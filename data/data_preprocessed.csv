"The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad. My dad actually recorded it off the TV. I must have watched is over 20 times, before the relatively recent release on DVD.<br /><br />I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is more comic.<br /><br />To put it another way, it's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese.<br /><br />I'm in no way complaining, the story and quality of animation are not detracted from, but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film.....",1,the first time i ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad  my dad actually recorded it off the tv  i must have watched is over 20 times  before the relatively recent release on dvd  i of course bought and watched the dvd and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed  in the first version  which i still have on vhs  the mood of the film  thanks to the dialogue  was actually very dark  however the new version  featuring van der beek et al  is more comic  to put it another way  its like watching the original us release of akira with that dub  before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the japanese  im in no way complaining  the story and quality of animation are not detracted from  but it does raise the question of whether miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film     
"This movie was just terrible, the first movie wasn't that great i mean it's ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one, why just not make this into an ongoing series like James Bond, i'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink, i don't understand, was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn't be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror, a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film.

"The one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel, was i would never get the time I used to watch this, back again. If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn try and earn what must have been then, the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned. Wooden acting, poor special effects, the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b-movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the Police, Military and Joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once. She must obviously be from another planet.

"I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then....<br /><br />Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where he meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life?<br /><br />Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if he's walked into Harrods. Then, he's bowled over at a T-shirt rack confirming he has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life.<br /><br />One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and ex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her ex hubbie. Does Freeman run to her defense....naw...he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. <br /><br />Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one or another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. <br /><br />Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis: uneducated, no white collar skills or experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills. In the end Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star',not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.",0,i had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews  then     heres my additional two cents to the already posted  excellent lost in translation review  premise  morgan is stuck in a dusty small town where he meets lovely scarlet who is working in the local supermarket  can morgan help elevate the lovely scarlet from her trailer trash life  realistic dialog  not  how about that shopping in target  first  freeman looks at the target interior as if hes walked into harrods  then  hes bowled over at a t shirt rack confirming he has never been in any store visited by lovely scarlet  morgan is detached from any and all aspects of scarlets reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in scarlets life  one reviewer enjoyed the scarlet and ex hubby fight scene where her survival  a car in this instance  requires she physically attack her ex hubbie  does freeman run to her defense    naw   hes cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real  sorry lot in life   freemans character believes a car wash and new very revealing  tight fitting blouse is the key to scarlets job interview  another sign that freeman is clueless  freemans endless stage talk where all aspects of scarlets reality are reduced to one or another stage related freeman experience was irritating   freeman is right to emphasize that scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis  uneducated  no white collar skills or experience  very poor  no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem  scarlet learns such life lessons from freeman as  some people pay  100 for a t shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills  in the end freeman offers scarlet little more than strange diversion with a star not even paying for gas for scarlets dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which freeman cares not to know 
"I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. The movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some Monastery, working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline. The acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be Thailand is eye-catching, but Claire Daines steals the entire movie, and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end, in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. The flaws are minute and I recommend the film, which seems buried sadly forever to rare TV showings. I for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only ""10"" rated films.

"This is an early film ""Pilot"" for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around ""exterminating"" peoples pets for money. If you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Rated R for swearing, violence, and drug use.<br /><br />Its not too offensive either (they dont actually show killing animals)",1,this is an early film  pilot  for the hit canadian tv show trailer park boys  it was played to executives at a few networks before showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series  great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films  the movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around  exterminating  peoples pets for money  if you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to  but they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout  watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series  i highly recommend it  rated r for swearing  violence  and drug use  its not too offensive either  they dont actually show killing animals 
"A demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life. Honest this is the plot of the movie. He try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body. For some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin. The sleaze style of the movie is laughable. No one in the movie can actually act including the head. The closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak and the ending is so badly done. Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move.

"This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film. The actors are all perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a different world. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough.

"""Cinderella"" is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried. Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. The duke searched every house, but finally found the women who it belonged to, Cinderella.<br /><br />Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950. This film is about a magical fairytale. In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her, but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love.<br /><br />My favorite thing about ""Cinderella"" is the music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I will never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love.

"I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. And my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut.<br /><br />It's watchable, but barely so. There are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would ya wrassle us up some Hamburger Helper Sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to MREs. Once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.<br /><br />The rationale for the encounter with the fearsome Rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. Yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned King to do exactly that. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie.

THE MATADOR is hit-man movie lite....if you can say that about a hit-man movie. The violence is never really shown but often introduced. At first I was scared I was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy BUT was happily surprised when I realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning. The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together. The writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes. This is a good film that I probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy.

"Viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence (now THAT is funny) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle, but, trust me folks, this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see, and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in, I'd say you've lost your sense of humor.<br /><br />David Niven plays a doomed and bravado-besotted RAF pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death. (Isn't it romantic...) Of course, he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance, and washes up on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle. (They immediately clinch).<br /><br />Looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts, (so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts, from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies'), the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love. We get it--fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like 'em back, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb...<br /><br />As for the quality of the production, the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing, and the lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. There are games played with Technicolor, (whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that), and foreshadowing, (so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck), and freeze-motion, (which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera).<br /><br />The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but, after that, it's all downhill. The (moving like an escalator is moving) staircase is hardly the Odessa Steps, to say the least, and I'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account. The movie overall is bad enough to be funny, and that's about the best thing I can say for it.",0,viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence  now that is funny  would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle  but  trust me folks  this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see  and if youre not laughing at it five minutes in  id say youve lost your sense of humor  david niven plays a doomed and bravado besotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable  female  air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love  just as hes plunging to his certain and fiery death   isnt it romantic     of course  hes spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance  and washes up on the beach  just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle   they immediately clinch   looking past the bizarre homo erotic subtexts   so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts  from a naked boy sitting bare butted in the sand playing the movies twilight zone esquire theme on his little flute  to a celestial courier so campy queen y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies   the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love  we get it  fly boys like girls in skirts and heels  and girls like em back  and  apparently  all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb    as for the quality of the production  the continuity editing is poor enough to induce cringing  and the lighting is  perhaps  even worse than that  but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad  there are games played with technicolor   whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that   and foreshadowing   so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the docs motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck   and freeze motion   which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera   the best shots are the early ones on the beach  but  after that  its all downhill  the  moving like an escalator is moving  staircase is hardly the odessa steps  to say the least  and id really caution anyone from feeling like theyd have to see this lame attempt at movie making on their account  the movie overall is bad enough to be funny  and thats about the best thing i can say for it 
"I was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible directing (the shot sequences do not flow) even though the director might say that that is what he is going for, it looks very uninspired and immature) the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs and the stock was low budget video. I would say that it wasn't even something as simple as mini digital video. <br /><br />There are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has, like through editing etc. But it is obvious that he just doesn't care.

"I really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie. This movie was not intended to be a ""deep thought"" movie, which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be. In fact, it would appear that if ANY movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2. Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people.<br /><br />This movie was an Action/Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be. And for an Action/Comedy, it was very well done. I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a Jamie Foxx fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.<br /><br />The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours, etc. etc. etc.) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist. Now the ""bad guys"" are actually the ""good guys"" and the REAL ""bad guy"" is an uber-geek.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.<br /><br />If you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in ""The Matrix"" or a drama such as ""Of Mice and Men"" then this movie isn't for you. But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you.

"This movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress. His head is chopped off and buried separately of his body...sounds like ""The Thing that wouldn't die"" doesn't it? Well it does play out a little like that, but once the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly. I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking ""When is it going to end""? The characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery. The only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track. Still I want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable. And don't read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town, there isn't...only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless. So for the most part I say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap.",0,this movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress  his head is chopped off and buried separately of his body   sounds like  the thing that wouldnt die  doesnt it  well it does play out a little like that  but once the body is reunited with the head  all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly  i mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and i kept thinking  when is it going to end   the characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid  the villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery  the only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track  still i want to see a horror movie  not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable  and dont read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town  there isnt   only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless  so for the most part i say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap 
"Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the lack of it), focusing on some seriously wacked, way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers. It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies. There was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. This film had cult classic written all over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet out on DVD. <br /><br />Hopefully soon.",1,saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system  a semi surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture  or the lack of it   focusing on some seriously wacked  way beyond the hollywood fringe dwellers  it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo  and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies  there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart  this film had cult classic written all over it  and im surprised its not yet out on dvd   hopefully soon 
"Although this is ""better"" than the first Mulva (which doesn't say much anyways, I would rather watch paint dry) it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these Low Budget Pictures guys. I was suckered into buying a few dvds to support some indy filmmakers and boy did I regret it. Some haven't even been officially ""released"" yet (not bootlegs-bought from the filmmakers themselves) and I can't even list how bad they all are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indy films that they are friends with. If you are friends of these guys, chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them. But for those that had to watch them? No way. Bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad plot...etc etc. These aren't even funny. I gave this one a 2 only because Debbie Rochon is in it and that is about it. Maybe it doesn't even deserve the 2. About a 1 1/16th star to show it was slightly better than the first (which I wish I could have rated in the negatives). If you want a decent no budget film, go pick up something from LBP's ""friends"" over at Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes.

"I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old ""sparkle"", however the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and Sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic",1,i used to love sabrina the teenage witch and have seen every single episode  i remember when i used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on nickelodeon  however when sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill  the best series has to be when she was friends with valerie  im not sure which one that is   from there the next series  friends with dreama  was still really good  but when she left high school it just didnt seem right  all the main characters seemed to have left  which meant that it didnt have as much of the old  sparkle   however the first series where sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable  however when her aunts leave and sabrina moves into their house it just isnt right  she is no longer a teenager  so therefore the name of the show isnt right and without hilda and zelda and josh the show just doesnt seem right  especially when sabrina nearly marries someone that isnt harvey  thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away  all in all i still love to watch the old episodes of sabrina the teenage witch  but i think the writers took it too far and should have left it with sabrina leaving high school  because after that the show definitely lost some of its magic
"Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, Emma (Grace Zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki), disappears. Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma's home, and she attempts to ""see how deep the rabbit hole goes"".<br /><br />Maybe it's a delayed influence from the success of M. Night Shyamalan's films, but slower-paced, understated horror films are a recent trend. In some cases, such as Hide and Seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as White Noise (2005), the pacing tends to kill the film. I didn't like The Grudge quite as much as Hide and Seek, but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.<br /><br />The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. One, it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with Ju-On (2000) (in particular, it's extremely close to the first half of Ju-On: The Grudge, aka Ju-On 3, from 2003). Two, as with many Japanese horror films, the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror, The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.<br /><br />Director Takashi Shimizu, also the director of the five Japanese entries in the Ju-On series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is atmosphere, creepiness, the uncanny, and for many viewers--scares. How well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to, or are used to, this different approach to film-making (although admittedly, some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the Ju-On series). Traditionally, American audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning ""rules"" for the ""monster"". A more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the U.S.<br /><br />However, even if you're not used to it, it's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give The Grudge a shot. This is a well written, well directed, well acted film, filled with unusual properties, such as the story interweaving a large number of ""main characters"" (which is done better here than the more episodic Ju-On 3), good cinematography, subtle production design touches (check out Gellar's clothes, which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emma's house, when Gellar first approaches), and beautifully effective horror material.<br /><br />Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing, and based on interviews on the DVD with Shimizu, have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore. Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture, it's interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.<br /><br />I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a ""here's what really happened"" flashback, but even that was fairly well done, and otherwise, this would have been a 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Now that I've said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: It's not that I'm anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release. There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, I'd rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just Japanese, but also Indian, Spanish, Chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.",1,karen  sarah

"And it's not because since her days on ""Clarissa Explains It All"" that I've had a bit of a crush on Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s, but was still able to get teenage roles. ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" was Hart's next big leap after her ""Clarissa"" days. Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life. She is aided in her endeavors by her two aunts and a wise-cracking black cat as she goes from high school, to college, and finally to her career in journalism.<br /><br />As usual, Hart is the show's heart & soul. ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" is quite moving and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was.

"Well well well. As good as John Carpenter's season 1 outing in ""Masters of Horror"" was, this is the complete opposite. He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with ""Cigarette Burns"" but ""Pro-Life"" is perhaps the worst I have seen from him.<br /><br />It's stupid, totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome, despite the less-than-an-hour running time. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd.<br /><br />And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD (one of them being me); did you see how Carpenter describes the film? He's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut, he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there. I fear the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope I'm proved wrong.<br /><br />I want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome, though. Technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and make up effects.",0,well well well  as good as john carpenters season 1 outing in  masters of horror  was  this is the complete opposite  he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with  cigarette burns  but  pro life  is perhaps the worst i have seen from him  its stupid  totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays its welcome  despite the less than an hour running time  the script is nonsense  the characters are irritable and un appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd  and for those suckers who actually bought the dvd  one of them being me   did you see how carpenter describes the film  hes actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time  and he praises the script  and in the commentary track  where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut  he just says he didnt feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there  i fear the old master has completely lost his touch  i sincerely hope im proved wrong  i want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome  though  technically speaking  this film is top notch  with effective lighting schemes and make up effects 
"My family and I screened Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog is ( my four year old loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie, was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face for making this movie. I will admit however, that the soundtrack was good. I wasn't sure if the movie was set in the 80's, but with the majority of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass.

"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** After two so-so outings (""Magnum Force"" and ""The Enforcer""), Dirty Harry seems to have regained his stride in ""Sudden Impact,"" a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes.<br /><br />For once, the case takes Harry outside his native San Francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his ""shoot first, ask questions later"" tactics), to the hamlet of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered, one at a time, by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack.<br /><br />The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke, and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. Locke's cold eyes and frosty voice, when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit.<br /><br />The rapists are a despicable lot, especially the leader, who has ""psycho nutjob"" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate. The flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are nightmarish enough, and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for Jennifer as she kills her assailants.<br /><br />Some will dismiss ""Sudden Impact"" as trash: a mindless, manipulative revenge tale. On a certain level this is true, but it's well-done trash. What works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the Sondra Locke performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view.<br /><br />You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to Harry (a realization that, wisely, is not spelled out with dialogue), he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare.<br /><br />The movie's other redeeming quality is Eastwood's direction. This is, after all, a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The movie is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff. Some of the best ""Harry moments"" in the entire series are here, including Harry's best-known line, ""Go ahead -- make my day.""<br /><br />""Sudden Impact"" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told. And it is certainly never dull.

"While a pleasant enough musical, what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as the has-been composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing a high strung, distracted artistic type (a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character looks like he couldn't find his way out of bed without help. And that help is Starbuck, played with his usual droll humor by Oscar Levant. Upon hiring Crosby's character as his ghost song writer, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck by saying, ""He does all my thinking for me."", to which Levant responds, ""Ah, it's only a part-time job."" Of course this goes right past (or over) Rathbone, who's too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny! Too bad he didn't have more opportunities to display his comedic talent.",1,while a pleasant enough musical  what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil rathbone  as the has been composer  and oscar levant as his assistant  playing a high strung  distracted artistic type  a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical sherlock holmes   rathbones character looks like he couldnt find his way out of bed without help  and that help is starbuck  played with his usual droll humor by oscar levant  upon hiring crosbys character as his ghost song writer  rathbone introduces him to starbuck by saying   he does all my thinking for me    to which levant responds   ah  its only a part time job   of course this goes right past  or over  rathbone  whos too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from  as another reviewer said  who knew rathbone could be so funny  too bad he didnt have more opportunities to display his comedic talent 
"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the ""Oddities"" program, after ""The Head"" and before ""Aeon Flux"" if I recall correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.<br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on. And then there's the other weird creatures...<br /><br />I use ""or"" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe they're all real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist. Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others. You'll have to wait and find out.<br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive. And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story... guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced. This was the best show to appear on ""Oddities"", hands down.<br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out.

"As Alan Rudolph's ""Breakfast of Champions"" slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when Keith Gordon's ""Mother Night"" came out. Now for all the talk of Kurt Vonnegut being ""unfilmable"" it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments (the other being ""Slaughter-house Five""). ""Mother Night"" is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and I cannot understand why. It's brilliant! It stays almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. How many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? Vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? Not only is it a beautiful film, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so American films of the 1990s. It's a mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I would sincerely encourage anyone to see ""Mother Night"" - it doesn't even take a familiarity with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as ""Slaughter-house Five"" sometimes does). It is a powerful, affecting piece of cinema.",1,as alan rudolphs  breakfast of champions  slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordons  mother night  came out  now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being  unfilmable  its surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments  the other being  slaughter house five     mother night  is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why  its brilliant  it stays almost entirely faithful to vonneguts book  without being stilted or overly literary  and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic  how many film adaptations of any authors work can claim that  vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film  and can you ask for a better endorsement than that  not only is it a beautiful film  it is a beautifully acted  written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s  its a mournful  inspired  surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected  i would sincerely encourage anyone to see  mother night    it doesnt even take a familiarity with vonneguts work to fully appreciate it  as  slaughter house five  sometimes does   it is a powerful  affecting piece of cinema 
"This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way(1993) is a great film. Goodgfellas it isn't but its one of the better crime films done. This movie should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe speed Zone. Remember those gems! The only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original. This movie lacked everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard on. There wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it.

"This is a strange sex comedy because there`s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex , most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES .

"Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle. Some men come looking for ivory and to take Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back...even if that means killing Tarzan.<br /><br />This is a rarity--a sequel that's better than the original. ""Tarzan, the Ape Man"" of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged. This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult. There is tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot to death point blank--and no one really cares) but this was 1934. There's also plenty of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and uncut prints have Jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude! There's also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing next to nothing and (it's implied) they sleep together and have sex--without being married. This wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme.<br /><br />That aside, the movie is well-directed, very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and Jane's outfit is pretty revealing too. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everybody else is OK.<br /><br />This is easily the best Weismuller--O'Hara Tarzan out there.

"Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana. Having seen the trailer, and being a thriller-lover, I expected to see first of all a fast moving, breath catching movie, which wisely dips in global policy-making and the relation between oil, power and corruption, from a fresh angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all characters were stereotyped, the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you don't care. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie.<br /><br />Robi Chernitsky",0,living in the middle east  in israel   i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana  having seen the trailer  and being a thriller lover  i expected to see first of all a fast moving  breath catching movie  which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil  power and corruption  from a fresh angle  well  i almost left the movie in the middle  the pace was painfully slow  almost all characters were stereotyped  the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult  but  as steve rhodes wrote in his review  in the end you dont care  save your money  save your time  choose another movie  robi chernitsky

Prince Charming, they all get excited, Cinderella overhears the exciting news and asks if she could come too.

Of course, she doesn't keep her promise and destroys a beautiful dress she and the mice made for the ball. Leaving poor Cinderella behind, a wonderful thing happens, Cinderella's fairy god mother appears and creates a beautiful dress and carriage out of things from around the house and even makes the mice and horses into elegant horses and a driver for the carriage. When the prince sees Cinderella at the ball, he has fallen hard for her. All the ladies are jealous, including her step mother and sisters. But Cinderella must return home at midnight when the spell is broken, all she leaves behind is her glass slipper.

"Contrary to another reviewer, I think that this is WELL-written, especially the more fictional it is, because greater imagination would be required; and well acted, because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen-minutes-plus, well-done monologues. But I'm just not entertained by such solemn, pious rememberances. Everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everybody has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, not-very-atypical stories and problems, exemplifying how anybody's life (or part of it) is fodder for film. Then again, I think poorly of TV's reality shows, too. So, if that's your bag, you may like this. It's the kind of stuff that would make for good 'phone and/or internet gossip; but absolutely without other-than-verbal action. And, although each of the speakers is female, I'm gonna leave gender outta this.",0,contrary to another reviewer  i think that this is well written  especially the more fictional it is  because greater imagination would be required  and well acted  because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen minutes plus  well done monologues  but im just not entertained by such solemn  pious rememberances  everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others  everybody has problems and some are more intense than others  these are just ten  not very atypical stories and problems  exemplifying how anybodys life  or part of it  is fodder for film  then again  i think poorly of tvs reality shows  too  so  if thats your bag  you may like this  its the kind of stuff that would make for good phone and or internet gossip  but absolutely without other than verbal action  and  although each of the speakers is female  im gonna leave gender outta this 
"""A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love"" describes this odd David Lynch film. This was especially ""odd"" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those ""dark"" films, too.<br /><br />This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an ""odd"" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that! <br /><br />Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released.<br /><br />The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his trip, the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill.<br /><br />I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this. Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way, such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada as ""Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but that's a joke: he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!<br /><br />The Iowa scenery is pleasant. I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil. It's a nice state with nice people....like this movie.",1, a truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love  describes this odd david lynch film  this was especially  odd  because it wasnt the kind of film lynch had been putting out in the last 15  20 years  those were dark and shocking films  blue velvet  wild at heart  mulholland drive  and this is the opposite  i know it disappointed a lot of his fans  others were delighted by it  count me as one of the latter  and i own all three of those  dark  films  too  this was another supposed true life story  here detailing an elderly mans trip in a seated lawnmower from western iowa all the way to wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasnt talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies  well  i guess that premise   an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles   still makes this an  odd  film of sorts  so lynch stays in character with that   richard farnsworth plays the title role  he is the type of guy  face wise  voice wise  low key personality wise  that just about everyone likes  the wrinkles on his face tell many a story  it was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released  the first 25 minutes of this film isnt much  and not always pleasant as it shows the main characters adult and mentally challenged child  sissy spacek  and her tragic past  but once alvin straight  farnsworth  begins his trip  the story picks up  i played this for several friends and they thought the film never picked up  but i am more generous with it  i think its a hidden gem  to them  it was a sleeping pill  i found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is not going to be a suspenseful lynch crime story  it is slow and if thats okay with you  you might like this  charm enters the picture in some of people alvin meets along the way  such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble   henry cada as  daniel riordan  is a standout in that regard   harry dean stanton gets third billing  but thats a joke  hes only in the final few minutes of the movie  the iowa scenery is pleasant  i lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil  its a nice state with nice people    like this movie 
"What I expected: A rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.<br /><br />What I got: An even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share.<br /><br />Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works! Barrymore is classic Barrymore: that perfect blend of sweet, strong, and adorable. We expect that from her and she delivered.<br /><br />But Fallon is the nice surprise in this film. He brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life, like caring about kids and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He can be caring (""You just ran across the field for me!"") and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the Red Sox (""How did the grass feel? Kinda spongy?"") at the same time. Fallon's portrayal ""made"" the movie. Hopefully, this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (i.e. Will Ferrell).<br /><br />In short, a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs. female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines, most delivered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon.<br /><br />Hey, I saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as I did.

"That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally , too.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad, too! One is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e'er she goes. The other is got up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual, slightly parted lips. And, not to give anything away, she is even more bad than the other.<br /><br />All three sisters are played by starlets. The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something of a career.<br /><br />This looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft-core porn ever marketed. Well, of course not the first but the raciest at that time.<br /><br />The girls wear as little as possible and let's not forget about the female audience members: Bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor -- whose fetish was this? -- bare-chested. He also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit.<br /><br />There's a real plot here, too: The girls' family, see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide -- or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide.<br /><br />The movie is not bad. I truly don't know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here. The women are scantily dressed. They often resemble lurid covers of mags like Police Detective or jackets of dime novels.<br /><br />But the guy seems to be the central focus.

"After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside, you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /><br />The warm feeling might still be there, but as others has said: The plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch. <br /><br />The movie gets sped up, and you get the impression that you're either fast forwarding through it, or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out.<br /><br />Realism isn't a goal onto itself, but as a viewer, I'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic, it just happens to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad script, I think that the actors performances are mainly good. If I could rate the first 25 minutes only, I'd probably give it an eight.

"this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i love Japanese movies, and i think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. i really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing. but i couldn't find anything entertaining about it.<br /><br />the movie takes forever for nothing to happen. and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting. a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything. this added nothing to the plot. a fellow Japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly. we couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was. and the finale was awful. i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this, but sadly i was mistaken.",0,this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen  i love japanese movies  and i think another film by the same director  electric dragon 80 000 v  is a masterpiece  i really wanted to like this movie   asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing  but i couldnt find anything entertaining about it  the movie takes forever for nothing to happen  and the effects the director used   like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion   merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting  a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary   like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesnt worship anything  this added nothing to the plot  a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly  we couldnt believe this film was as terrible as it was  and the finale was awful  i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this  but sadly i was mistaken 
"Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I don't typically go for military/war movies, but this was worth my time.<br /><br />It was serious, but it was also humorous.

He wasn't just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun.<br /><br />The ending through me a little though.

"I have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and I would first like to say that I understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well: viewed from an Israeli perspective, I can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie. What I would like to say is that 'Distortion' was shown at a film festival in Geneva in November 2005 (Festival 'Cinéma tout écran') where it won the award of the audience ('Prix du public'in French). For what affects me, I liked the 'nervous camera' work of Mr Bouzaglo, who, in my opinion, portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well, and I think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie. This perspective, however, might seem totally 'alien' to an Israeli viewer, but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers, because Switzerland is a country which has NEVER been subject to any terrorist attack. It therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in Geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached' perspective.I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a Geneva newspaper (I'm translating from French): ''After 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence, we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal.We might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living. We are like the characters in my movie,''on the edge of the edge''. This is the reason why the private detective, who is somehow ''voyeur'' is the happiest character in the movie, because he earns a living thanks to the system, he takes advantage of this situation'' This is, in substance, the main thing that I and the swiss public, in my opinion, pointed out in this movie, and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor. So, to sum up, different country=different perspective, but I think that this is somehow great, because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema, that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique' of 'formatted' way of thinking.",1,i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well  viewed from an israeli perspective  i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie  what i would like to say is that distortion was shown at a film festival in geneva in november 2005  festival cinéma tout écran  where it won the award of the audience  prix du publicin french   for what affects me  i liked the nervous camera work of mr bouzaglo  who  in my opinion  portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well  and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie  this perspective  however  might seem totally alien to an israeli viewer  but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers  because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack  it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more detached perspective i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper  im translating from french   after 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence  we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living  we are like the characters in my movie on the edge of the edge  this is the reason why the private detective  who is somehow voyeur is the happiest character in the movie  because he earns a living thanks to the system  he takes advantage of this situation this is  in substance  the main thing that i and the swiss public  in my opinion  pointed out in this movie  and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor  so  to sum up  different country different perspective  but i think that this is somehow great  because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema  that is to say that it well never be subject to a unique of formatted way of thinking 
"What the hell is this? ""Kooky drama""? ""Lawyers in Loony Tunes Land""? The world's thinnest, most duck-faced actress (even more duck-faced and anorexic than Michelle Pfeiffer) overacts her bony butt off, making cretinous grimaces that would shame Bugs Bunny, in one of the most animated non-animated TV series ever. This is also the most annoying one-hour-format TV show ever, hence the worst.<br /><br />All the men act like pansies, and I for one refuse to believe that even hip big-city shysters are all as delta-male-like as this sorry (short) bunch. Wuss Peter MacNicol manages to be even more irritating than Calista Flockofducks with his fake Hollywood ""shshshs"" speech impediment: it's the sort of pseudo-inability to pronounce the letter ""S"" by turning it into a moronic ""SH"" that the likes of Jon Shtewart and Christian Shlater also practice with zeal. Watching MacNicol talk, I always wonder how come his jaw doesn't dislocate... Human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the ""SH"" sound more than three times per second. He is a medical wonder.<br /><br />This badly conceived and written legal-drama/comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s PC. It has POLITICAL CORRECTNESS written with huge, neon letters. Is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of LAWYERS being full of ideals, high principles, and moral fiber? Laughable, but that's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in Hollywood since its inception. After all, what is more noble than defending a murderer, a rapist, or a thief? When a TV series as retarded as ""Ally McBeak"" starts preaching to America about how it should run the country, then it must be time for Paris Hilton to become President. ""Ally McQuack"" is both a product of recent and large-scale Western dumbing-down and a perpetrator of it.<br /><br />Those supposed touches of ""eccentricity"", like the UNBELIEVABLY annoying musical numbers, are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny. This is no Monty Python. Whatever ""new"" the talent-free makers of this garbage were aiming for, they failed with honours. ""Ally McBeak"" is a highly commercialized TV venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies, bored housewives, and bipolar lawyers.

"I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin. Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books I was very excited about this movie's premier, which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch. Normally I'm enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well. Usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the original's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying. It probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either. Most performances were ridiculously over the top, which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film. All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by. Really, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful. It was with out a doubt the low point of the film.<br /><br />What a joke. Don't see this movie.

"I'd never seen a Tarzan movie before so when I saw it on the tele I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not how I'd imagined Tarzan would look. And, unless I missed it while making myself a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell. Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine.<br /><br />Oh well, so much for expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - The monkey Cheeta was there.

"If an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts, and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts, it won't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex.

"Watching The Tenants has been a interesting experience for me. It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the (non)action - and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to Serbo-Croat indie and find them fascinating.<br /><br />The Tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over-orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue, apart from the set pieces where characters 'collide' in a very structured setting (to make this work, the film needed to feel more conceptual, which it didn't). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone seems two-dimensional.<br /><br />The worse for this is the character of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic. At one point, I even stopped the film because I got so annoyed by the character's aggressive, violent and monotonal delivery, the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary ""on"" switch (which gets really predictable after a while) and I so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities. However, one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film (supposedly 70s, it feels and looks more early noughties). If it had been more securely fixed in the 70s, his character might have seemed more understandable.<br /><br />The lighting of the film was also awkward. All the way through, the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty, jazz-infused atmosphere that just did not come off, largely because the set was too well-lit.<br /><br />The Tenants, to me, is an unbelievable film. It doesn't depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race, identity or the life of a writer, be they white or black.<br /><br />Strangely, I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his eerie, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable.",0,watching the tenants has been a interesting experience for me  it is the first film i have ever seen where i have shuttled at speed through parts of the  non action   and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to serbo croat indie and find them fascinating  the tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over orchestrated  one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue  apart from the set pieces where characters collide in a very structured setting  to make this work  the film needed to feel more conceptual  which it didnt   this leads to a lack of realistic character development  everyone seems two dimensional  the worse for this is the character of bill spear  aka snoop dogg  i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic  at one point  i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the characters aggressive  violent and monotonal delivery  the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary  on  switch  which gets really predictable after a while  and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities  however  one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film  supposedly 70s  it feels and looks more early noughties   if it had been more securely fixed in the 70s  his character might have seemed more understandable  the lighting of the film was also awkward  all the way through  the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty  jazz infused atmosphere that just did not come off  largely because the set was too well lit  the tenants  to me  is an unbelievable film  it doesnt depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race  identity or the life of a writer  be they white or black  strangely  i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch  his eerie  clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable 
"Robin Williams gave a fine performance in The Night Listener as did the other cast members. However, the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a ""must see."" I think the problem happens because there isn't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the Gabriel Noon(I had to spell it this way, because IMDb wants to auto correct the right spelling to ""No one"") character. The movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, Noon begins his search for Pete Logande, the boy caller.<br /><br />This happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversations aren't too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you... I'm in the hospital...why did you boyfriend move out... etc. In the book, the kid almost becomes Noon's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax.<br /><br />In the movie, Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left to wonder why? Since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between Noon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller doesn't exist? <br /><br />I know there's a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen, because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie. Since it doesn't, the movie falls apart.<br /><br />This is surprising because of Maupin's other work, Tales of the City.

"I was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters, however, I wasn't able to get around to it. So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I plopped the dvd in the player, settled in the for an evening of murder, and pressed play. What followed was one of the more engaging flicks I've seen in the last couple years.<br /><br />*SOME SPOILERS*<br /><br />This is the story of the Wonderland murders, which led to the seediest parts of LA and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70's, John Holmes (Val Kilmer).<br /><br />I was hooked from the beginning, and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after. Aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning, and the actual showing of the murders towards the end, the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting. Val Kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star, and even the ""beautiful but that's it"" Bosworth was a joy to watch (and just for her looks, mind you)<br /><br />I personally felt the best aspect of the movie was, as I mentioned, its lack of outright showing the murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you couldn't completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome. Furthermore, the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite. They were being beating with lead pipes, there's not much more that needs to be said.<br /><br />My only real problem was Carrie Fisher's brief appearence. Her portrayal of the overly-religious figure was, I think, a bit too cliche of her appearence. Maybe that person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but I wasn't sold, and for some reason, Fisher seemed a bit too ""akward"" in her portrayal.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent movie worth the watch, even if once!<br /><br />***8/10***",1,i was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters  however  i wasnt able to get around to it  so  finally  it hit the shelves  and i picked it up  not knowing exactly what to expect  i plopped the dvd in the player  settled in the for an evening of murder  and pressed play  what followed was one of the more engaging flicks ive seen in the last couple years   some spoilers  this is the story of the wonderland murders  which led to the seediest parts of la and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70s  john holmes  val kilmer   i was hooked from the beginning  and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end  i was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after  aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning  and the actual showing of the murders towards the end  the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting  val kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star  and even the  beautiful but thats it  bosworth was a joy to watch  and just for her looks  mind you  i personally felt the best aspect of the movie was  as i mentioned  its lack of outright showing the murders  it was shown in a very dark atmosphere  so you couldnt completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome  furthermore  the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite  they were being beating with lead pipes  theres not much more that needs to be said  my only real problem was carrie fishers brief appearence  her portrayal of the overly religious figure was  i think  a bit too cliche of her appearence  maybe that person was actually part of the story  maybe not  but i wasnt sold  and for some reason  fisher seemed a bit too  akward  in her portrayal  overall  an excellent movie worth the watch  even if once     8 10

"Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch are among the funnier women to have been on ""Saturday Night Live"". It's unfortunate that they, along with Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph, were on SNL during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch-making (circa 2002-2006) the show has ever had. Still, these two women most especially know what's funny, and they know how to write a funny movie.<br /><br />You'll notice in the credits of this movie that Dratch and director Ryan Shiraki wrote the story for ""Spring Breakdown"", but who wrote the actual screenplay, consisting of dialogue and all the important fill-in-the-blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie? Yep, just Shiraki. Just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie, and no women apparently wrote the script with him. The result is a pretty cliché spring break movie that doesn't so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as MTV does every year.<br /><br />If Dratch, Poehler, and even co-star Parker Posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay, it would have been far less cliché. The premise is original, being about three thirty-something women who were unpopular in high school (and apparently college, too) who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about. I say ""allegedly"" because you never quite know what fun is to these characters. They entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro-woman anthems like ""True Colors"", and spend their nights together holding make-your-own-pizza parties. Even though none of them are especially unattractive, the outside world appears to treat them like they are. There's a scene where a blind student of Poehler's (played by Poehler's real life husband Will Arnett) asks her out on a date, only to touch her face and immediately change his mind. If Poehler's character is supposed to be unattractive, they obviously hired the wrong actress.<br /><br />The movie continues to show promise, even though we have our doubts about the main characters, when Posey's boss, Texas Senator 'Kay Bee' Hartmann (Jane Lynch, funny as always) hires Posey to watch over her unpopular college-age daughter (Amber Tamblyn, playing yet another woman who's attractive in real life, but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie) while she goes to a Laguna Beach-like vacation spot for Spring Break. Poehler and Dratch come along, they reluctantly get boozed up, party like they apparently should have when they were in college, and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by Sophie Monk.<br /><br />Sophie Monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons. Unfortunately, her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny ""Date Movie"" (2006) and the disappointing ""Click"" (2006). Here, she plays a Southern belle, although her voice sounds like she stole Delta Burke's voice box. She hams it up a little too much, trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras.<br /><br />""Spring Breakdown"" was released straight to DVD despite the star power of Amy Poehler, but rightly so because the story is way too cliché. It may as well have been called ""National Lampoon's Spring Breakdown"", and the magazine probably wouldn't have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity. If director Shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input, especially Rachel Dratch, this movie would have been great and not nearly as run-of-the-mill as frat-house comedies we've seen before. I know Dratch will come up with another funny concept, and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself. She's funny enough, and she deserves better than this half-baked comedy that would accept Stiffler's brother with open arms.",0,amy poehler and rachel dratch are among the funnier women to have been on  saturday night live   its unfortunate that they  along with tina fey and maya rudolph  were on snl during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch making  circa 2002 2006  the show has ever had  still  these two women most especially know whats funny  and they know how to write a funny movie  youll notice in the credits of this movie that dratch and director ryan shiraki wrote the story for  spring breakdown   but who wrote the actual screenplay  consisting of dialogue and all the important fill in the blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie  yep  just shiraki  just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie  and no women apparently wrote the script with him  the result is a pretty cliché spring break movie that doesnt so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as mtv does every year  if dratch  poehler  and even co star parker posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay  it would have been far less cliché  the premise is original  being about three thirty something women who were unpopular in high school  and apparently college  too  who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about  i say  allegedly  because you never quite know what fun is to these characters  they entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro woman anthems like  true colors   and spend their nights together holding make your own pizza parties  even though none of them are especially unattractive  the outside world appears to treat them like they are  theres a scene where a blind student of poehlers  played by poehlers real life husband will arnett  asks her out on a date  only to touch her face and immediately change his mind  if poehlers character is supposed to be unattractive  they obviously hired the wrong actress  the movie continues to show promise  even though we have our doubts about the main characters  when poseys boss  texas senator kay bee hartmann  jane lynch  funny as always  hires posey to watch over her unpopular college age daughter  amber tamblyn  playing yet another woman whos attractive in real life  but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie  while she goes to a laguna beach like vacation spot for spring break  poehler and dratch come along  they reluctantly get boozed up  party like they apparently should have when they were in college  and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by sophie monk  sophie monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons  unfortunately  her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny  date movie   2006  and the disappointing  click   2006   here  she plays a southern belle  although her voice sounds like she stole delta burkes voice box  she hams it up a little too much  trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras   spring breakdown  was released straight to dvd despite the star power of amy poehler  but rightly so because the story is way too cliché  it may as well have been called  national lampoons spring breakdown   and the magazine probably wouldnt have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity  if director shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input  especially rachel dratch  this movie would have been great and not nearly as run of the mill as frat house comedies weve seen before  i know dratch will come up with another funny concept  and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself  shes funny enough  and she deserves better than this half baked comedy that would accept stifflers brother with open arms 
"A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a particular mention for the ""Portobello Ballet"" are gorgeous. As for the animated section, the match between animals has become an instant classic; the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating. I recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video. Here in Italy we have only the 98 minutes version, although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes. If possible, watch also the German videocassette: it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it's missing of every refer to World War II and of all the scenes between English people and their Nazi invaders!",1,a great movie  lansbury and tomlinson are perfect  the songs are wonderful  the dances  with a particular mention for the  portobello ballet  are gorgeous  as for the animated section  the match between animals has become an instant classic  the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating  i recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video  here in italy we have only the 98 minutes version  although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes  if possible  watch also the german videocassette  it was generated from the 98 minutes running but its missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders 
"If you are a Crispin Glover fan, you must see this. If you are a Sean Penn fan, you must see this. If you are a movie fan in general, you must see this. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this film will probably still have a lot of value, but the more work you've previously seen by Crispin or Sean, the better.<br /><br />This movie is so funny, but it is also pure genius. There is nothing that I know of that resembles this film. It is its own genre. I doubt that anything like it will ever be made again. I cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that. <br /><br />In response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review, I ask that you view the film again. In reality, there is no point at which this film could fairly be called ""boring."" This is possibly the funniest, most entertaining, and least boring film ever made. And it only gets better with age and repeated viewings. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim to have seen.<br /><br />Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover also stars in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent searching though, and there are a couple of ways to find it that I know of.

"La Coda Dello Scorpione (a.k.a. Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was director Sergio Martino's follow-up to the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the quintessential giallo, featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love. Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of Italian exploitation.<br /><br />A group of gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-Argento gialli around. There's the aforementioned Martino adding his touches as director, giallo great Ernesto Gastaldi as the writer, Bruno Nicolai creating the music, and a host of giallo stars and starlets, such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli, and the fetching Anita Strindberg.<br /><br />With all this talent behind it, does Scorpione deliver? You bet. The film works on many different levels. It's a thrilling murder mystery, a tense and violent horror film, and a suspenseful thriller. All in all one of the best gialli around.<br /><br />Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. At some points in the film, he almost seems to be channeling Argento in his approach. For example, there is a direct rip-off of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage where the killer tries to break through the door, that actually outdoes Argento's flick.<br /><br />Are there any problems with the flick? Hmmm... only minor ones. First, any scenes that aren't following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore. But just before you fall asleep, the killer will pop out of nowhere and you'll be right back in the swing of things.<br /><br />Also, towards the end, the twists get a little too bizarre. I mean, what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve? If you don't play close attention to the dialogue, you could easily become lost with the twisting, weaving storyline.<br /><br />But these minor quibbles aside, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, suspenseful, classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans.

"This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I feel better. This movie is poor from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad.

"This movie could have been a decent B-movie if 3/4 of the the movie wasn't so much focusing on the sex scenes. I mean, he's a sex addict, and I'm sure that there's a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what all he had to do, which wasn't much. At one point or another, one would have to laugh at him, because his character was so pitiful. Nastassja Kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist, she could've of done more though and I'm not suggesting her having sex. The person that stood out the most to me in this movie was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife. There's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me. She played that role and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her.<br /><br />""Diary Of A Sex Addict"" while not Oscar material or a modern classic to anyone's standards, is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of.",0,this movie could have been a decent b movie if 3 4 of the the movie wasnt so much focusing on the sex scenes  i mean  hes a sex addict  and im sure that theres a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis  michael des barres did a good job considering what all he had to do  which wasnt much  at one point or another  one would have to laugh at him  because his character was so pitiful  nastassja kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist  she couldve of done more though and im not suggesting her having sex  the person that stood out the most to me in this movie was rosanna arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife  theres something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me  she played that role and as you watched the movie  you start to feel bad for her   diary of a sex addict  while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyones standards  is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how ones personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of 
"I tried to watch this movie three separate times. The night I rented it. Got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night's rest. Watched 15 more the next day, almost vomited at how stupid it was... It wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the dumb thing and I didn't enjoy one single moment! Not even one. How did this script get greenlighted.

"Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was PAINFUL to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didn't work at all.",0,wow  i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast  justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had  his acting was painful to observe  the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors  heck  even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on  how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend  his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass  and he is supposed to be the hero    i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video  maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned  this may be ok  watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human kermit the frog act in a hollywood blockbuster  just didnt work at all

"The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killers location, Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. One is left to ponder would an FBP agent hand a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female. It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen.

"Say what you will about schmaltz. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about some Americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose.<br /><br />To me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny says, ""We've been shaken out of the magnolias.""<br /><br />In today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the 9/11 murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world.<br /><br />Today, we watch this film with a new awareness: That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things.<br /><br />Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote.<br /><br />A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals.<br /><br />Geoff",1,say what you will about schmaltz  one beauty of this film is that it is not pro american  it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion  it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose  to me  the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly  bette davis mother and brother   as fanny says   weve been shaken out of the magnolias   in todays political climate where  led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9 11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings  we sunk to the level of the 9 11 murderers to seek blood thirsty vengeance  it cant all be blamed on mr  bush   after all  we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re elected him after his lies had been exposed  now  with complete justification  we americans are reviled throughout the world  today  we watch this film with a new awareness  that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character  but  a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts  im not comparing george bush to adolph hitler  but  i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror  hatred  and hyper nationalism to do despicable things  sadly  the blackmailer  who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement  no matter how immoral  is most like the leaders of our country  those who support them  and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand  that they cant even be bothered to vote  a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be   a force for the betterment of humanity   and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals  geoff

"Greetings again from the darkness. Remember all the ""What happened to Woody Allen?"" jokes? Even Mr. Allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same ""funny"" films. As with any great artist, Mr. Allen's craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans, while picking up others. Last year's masterpiece ""Matchpoint"" showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan"". What is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that Mr. New York himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country. Apparently he actually likes England!! While filming ""Matchpoint"", Mr. Allen became enamored with Scarlett Johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor. This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years. Scarlett, while risking overexposure, must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light. She is unafraid to look and act like a real person. In ""Scoop"", she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and, in many scenes, delivers the real punchline to Mr. Allen's straight man. Of course, any time Mr. Allen decides to put himself in front of the camera, he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in - which is fine, because few do it better.<br /><br />Very nice support work from Ian McShane and Hugh Jackman. In fact, Mr. Jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace Brosnan as the new Bond. As with most of Allen's films, the star is the script, not the actors. Although Scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished Allen and Jackman, what makes this one crackle is the dialogue ... especially the banter between Allen and Scarlett. If you are not a huge Woody the actor fan, fear not. He does limit his screen time and he is quite effective, except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place. Another Woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and ""Scoop"" is no exception ... especially the Strauss composition.<br /><br />""Scoop"" is a nice cross between ""Annie Hall"" and the best of the Marx Brothers films or the Cary Grant comedies. Yes it is an adult comedy, but it is actually very cute ... especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy!!",1,greetings again from the darkness  remember all the  what happened to woody allen   jokes  even mr  allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same  funny  films  as with any great artist  mr  allens craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans  while picking up others  last years masterpiece  matchpoint  showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of  annie hall  and  manhattan   what is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that mr  new york himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country  apparently he actually likes england   while filming  matchpoint   mr  allen became enamored with scarlett johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor  this attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years  scarlett  while risking overexposure  must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light  she is unafraid to look and act like a real person  in  scoop   she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and  in many scenes  delivers the real punchline to mr  allens straight man  of course  any time mr  allen decides to put himself in front of the camera  he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in   which is fine  because few do it better  very nice support work from ian mcshane and hugh jackman  in fact  mr  jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace brosnan as the new bond  as with most of allens films  the star is the script  not the actors  although scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished allen and jackman  what makes this one crackle is the dialogue     especially the banter between allen and scarlett  if you are not a huge woody the actor fan  fear not  he does limit his screen time and he is quite effective  except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place  another woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and  scoop  is no exception     especially the strauss composition   scoop  is a nice cross between  annie hall  and the best of the marx brothers films or the cary grant comedies  yes it is an adult comedy  but it is actually very cute     especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy  
"The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are at it again. With ""Fever Pitch"" the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes, abandon that tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's film to the screen, something that it would have been hard to do. The novel, of the same title, dealt with a man's obsession with soccer, since it is set in England, where that sport consumes most of British sports fans. It's to the credit of the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell, to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most Americans, when they make their hero, a Boston Red Sox fan.<br /><br />""Fever Pitch"" is a film that presents an obsessive fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life revolves into the Red Sox season, and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them. When Ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm, he meets, and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who is going places, but at thirty, has no life of her own.<br /><br />The story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the Red Sox, at home games, in Fenway Park. This team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world, having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but, until 2004, never won a World Series. In fact, the ending, from what we heard, had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film. Ms. Barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a popular television comedian, turned movie actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in ""Taxi"", in our humble opinion.<br /><br />The Farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale.",1,the farrelly brothers  bobby and peter  are at it again  with  fever pitch  the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes  abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornbys film to the screen  something that it would have been hard to do  the novel  of the same title  dealt with a mans obsession with soccer  since it is set in england  where that sport consumes most of british sports fans  its to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell  to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans  when they make their hero  a boston red sox fan   fever pitch  is a film that presents an obsessive fan  ben wrightly  whose life revolves into the red sox season  and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them  when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm  he meets  and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks  a young woman who is going places  but at thirty  has no life of her own  the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox  at home games  in fenway park  this teams fans are probably the most loyal people in the world  having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but  until 2004  never won a world series  in fact  the ending  from what we heard  had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years  drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film  ms  barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera  jimmy fallon  a popular television comedian  turned movie actor  has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in  taxi   in our humble opinion  the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale 
"As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter, as AMC billed it as a comedy. I have never been more disappointed with a film! Cary's usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire movie; he comes across as strained, bored, and just not himself. Mississip's character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I have ever witnessed - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, according to which part of Mississippi he claims to hail from), and whenever he does deliver a line, it's several decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable, country-bumpkin goofball, but in the end, he manages only to detract from the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene blow-up doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability, this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with. Ray Walston's character was sugary and ultimately contrived. For four men on shore leave, it was the tamest leave I've ever seen. I watched this nightmare until its very end, and while I won't spoil that for anyone, I will tell you that it's the most absurd you'll ever see. The film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men, but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast. Sorry, Cary!",0,as an avid fan of cary grant  i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter  as amc billed it as a comedy  i have never been more disappointed with a film  carys usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie  he comes across as strained  bored  and just not himself  mississips character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed   his accent is terribly exaggerated  and incorrect  according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from   and whenever he does deliver a line  its several decibels higher than any other cast member  mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable  country bumpkin goofball  but in the end  he manages only to detract from the already weak plot  mansfield looks more like an obscene blow up doll than a hollywood sex kitten  and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability  this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with  ray walstons character was sugary and ultimately contrived  for four men on shore leave  it was the tamest leave ive ever seen  i watched this nightmare until its very end  and while i wont spoil that for anyone  i will tell you that its the most absurd youll ever see  the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men  but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast  sorry  cary 
"There's no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you'd use for other movies. This is because it isn't a movie. It's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film. What we see are not the unfoldings of a plot, but rather a sequence of events that we don't see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends. We we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us- no one we know, but we've doubtless heard of them in a book or on TV or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, driving, and inevitably, escaping. Only the escape is from something intangible- it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness, or...human nature. Set in late 1960s Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence. These creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any trait we can imagine if we desire. Although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible, , the characters are not themselves criminals. They are human beings seeking a return to a familiar, non-manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday. Not that they are ever happy or sad, but they achieve a type of self actualization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living. They only achieve true life in the natural world, even though that is the next victim of modern existence. At the end, 'Zabriski Point' is a eulogy of humanities attachment to the natural world. As even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress, we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit.",1,theres no way to confront zabriskie point from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions youd use for other movies  this is because it isnt a movie  its an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film  what we see are not the unfoldings of a plot  but rather a sequence of events that we dont see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends  we we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us  no one we know  but weve doubtless heard of them in a book or on tv or somewhere  so what do we see  events  we see people arguing  driving  and inevitably  escaping  only the escape is from something intangible  it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness  or   human nature  set in late 1960s los angeles  our players act against and in response to the self inflicted miseries of modern existence  these creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any trait we can imagine if we desire  although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible    the characters are not themselves criminals  they are human beings seeking a return to a familiar  non manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday  not that they are ever happy or sad  but they achieve a type of self actualization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living  they only achieve true life in the natural world  even though that is the next victim of modern existence  at the end  zabriski point is a eulogy of humanities attachment to the natural world  as even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress  we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit 
"Whilst I have loved haunted house movies such as Amityville and Poltergeist, this made for TV adaption of Susan Hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of Hollywood.<br /><br />With a brilliant cast (many of which star in Heartbeat and other TV dramas), great acting, and fantastic setting (which portrays 1920's life convincingly), it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost story.<br /><br />Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence, or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience. Using your own imagination, the Woman In Black is a figure of fear and dread, and whose presence is never absent once she first appears.<br /><br />The main character Arthur Kidd, a solicitor, learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate. The widow dies and Arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities, which may haunt him for some days. Some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic, particularly the locked room which opens itself, which turns the generator off and closes Arthur in darkness. The film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in Arthurs shoes, and his efforts to shake this ghost off. The writer puts many chilling additions into the story, an example being the tin soldier's re-appearance. One is eager to learn the meaning of it all. The fact we never really learn that much about the widow, leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettling.<br /><br />The widow for the most part, looks vicious and intimidating. The scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me, a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind  having been on such properties myself I can appreciate how isolating this is. And the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things I've seen, one I don't wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives. I have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep.<br /><br />The Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost gem. I agree to some extent the Internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of £50 on it, but I think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these over-exposed. I think it's still brilliant and fantastically acted and I consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century.",1,whilst i have loved haunted house movies such as amityville and poltergeist  this made for tv adaption of susan hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of hollywood  with a brilliant cast  many of which star in heartbeat and other tv dramas   great acting  and fantastic setting  which portrays 1920s life convincingly   it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost story  herbert wise did not need blood  violence  or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience  using your own imagination  the woman in black is a figure of fear and dread  and whose presence is never absent once she first appears  the main character arthur kidd  a solicitor  learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate  the widow dies and arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities  which may haunt him for some days  some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic  particularly the locked room which opens itself  which turns the generator off and closes arthur in darkness  the film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in arthurs shoes  and his efforts to shake this ghost off  the writer puts many chilling additions into the story  an example being the tin soldiers re appearance  one is eager to learn the meaning of it all  the fact we never really learn that much about the widow  leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettling  the widow for the most part  looks vicious and intimidating  the scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me  a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind  having been on such properties myself i can appreciate how isolating this is  and the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things ive seen  one i dont wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives  i have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep  the woman in black is a great tv movie and a lost gem  i agree to some extent the internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of £50 on it  but i think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these over exposed  i think its still brilliant and fantastically acted and i consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century 
"The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in his film ""Jawab'(1985) too. The problem here is Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action-thriller (viz. Khakee) or an emotions-rich heavy duty drama (Viz. Damini) and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome. If we ignore two of his-Pukar (2000) and Lajja(2001), this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value. Therefore this film comes as a surprise, as to what made this script sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of his protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over, audience didn't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with his own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee"" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character. That is not all, there is more to it. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don, operating from abroad looks quite illogical. His openly landing up at Mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable. Pitching a mediocre, newcomer actor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points. Ashok Mehta's fine camera-work, two good fight sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some light well-acted scenes of Akshay Kumar in the Ist half, Santoshi's fast-paced slick treatment and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character.

"I had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently. I believe that it will be in theaters in Canada some time around Mother's Day. If it is in a theater near you... GO! It's not a funny feel-good movie - it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie.<br /><br />The director does an excellent job of character development - letting you into the heart, mind and hurts of Hagar little by little. At first, her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes someone you can understand. As in life... understanding brings empathy. I found her likable by the end of the movie - particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake.<br /><br />Hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful - and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat - and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare.<br /><br />It's fun to see Ellen Page acting in this movie. She is so very different than the young woman that she plays in Juno. It gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability. If you loved her in Juno, you'll love her in The Stone Angel.<br /><br />Of course, there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played. Never once in the course of this movie did I ever think of Ellen Burnstyn - I always and only thought of Hagar.

"To my surprise I quite enjoyed 'Spacecamp', i remember seeing it about 13 years ago, and recently I hired it again. I was quite impressed. Obviously the special effects in todays space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story- a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it. But thats what I liked about it- they don't make films like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot. Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx, it was very cute, but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (i think).",1,to my surprise i quite enjoyed spacecamp  i remember seeing it about 13 years ago  and recently i hired it again  i was quite impressed  obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp  however  this film had a story  a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it  but thats what i liked about it  they dont make films like this anymore  so it was a refreshing change  it was interesting to see kelly preston  leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles  with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light   fluffy plot  absolutely loved the robot named jinx  it was very cute  but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters  the film was almost inspirational in its own way  and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama  i think  
"I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever. When I watched Valentine, I was amazed at how great the story line actually was. It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor, and I admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring, but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful. It had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets. I recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills.

"I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene. This film immediately leaves you scratching your head. as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are with hand throwing distance they can't be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away. His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it's opening. The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers. Avoid this film.

"It is not known whether Marilyn Monroe ever met and spoke with Albert Einstein (and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death, we may never know), but in their lifetime the opportunity was there.<br /><br />Scripted by Terry Johnson from his own play, Nicolas Roeg's Insignificance imagines an encounter in a New York hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus Joe DiMaggio (Busey), and Senator Joseph McCarthy (Curtis) - but only on one level. On another level, it elevates - or reduces - these 'personalities' (and what a lousy phrase that is) to mere avatars (the characters are deliberately unnamed), at once greater and lesser in status.<br /><br />The title Insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic; here, DiMaggio's net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card. Monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress, hair, lipstick, wiggle and voice. By uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles, the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity, exploding the cult of personality.<br /><br />Furthering the theme, there will be another explosion at the film's climax: Hiroshima in a hotel suite, in which 'The Actress' is burned to a cinder in seconds; a literal deconstruction of fame. Goodbye, Norma Jean. History informs the script, which in turn, shakes history upside down. As Roeg mused after watching Johnson's play for the first time, ""These characters were mythic, not invented by any single person, not the public or the press, probably not even by the characters themselves."" As played by Theresa Russell, Marilyn (a closet intellectual in real life), lectures a childlike Einstein ('The Professor', played by Emil) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight, while getting The Professor to show off his legs, in conscious parody of her own role in The Seven-Year Itch, the movie The Actress is seen to be working on in the film's opening.<br /><br />History records that Monroe's then-husband, fading baseball star DiMaggio (played by Busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton), was unhappy about her iconic dress-splaying scene in the film, precipitating their break-up. Right on cue, we discover the jealous 'Ballplayer' in a bar, bemoaning the fact that if, ""I want to see her underwear, I just walk down to the corner like all the other guys"".<br /><br />In contrast to The Professor, The Ballplayer believes the universe is round - a contention shared by Native Americans. But the Big Chief (Sampson, of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest fame) who operates the Roosevelt Hotel's elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture: ""I no longer Cherokee - I watch TV."" Meanwhile, 'The Senator' is investigating The Professor, who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the United Nations, but whom The Senator suspects is a Red. In fact, as he divulges to Monroe, Einstein is wracked with guilt over Hiroshima, and what the white heat future holds. Yet in a seemingly godless universe, all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher (atomic) power.<br /><br />Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson's stage play to the screen. Throughout, tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forwards (ka-boom!) draw unexpected connections between time, place and circumstance, with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time's passing - but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time; each moment co-existing. As evinced by his back catalogue, it's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity - see Don't Look Now in particular. Here, 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip-feeds into the 1980s, a period in which another 'Actor' has taken on his greatest role as the President of the United States.<br /><br />If all this sounds rather heavy going (quantum physics is surely involved), the execution is anything but, owing to Johnson's witty, zippy screenplay, Roeg's playful direction, opening out an essentially stagey set-up - and the cast themselves, who are on stellar form. Tony Curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid, impotent Senator, who is seen attempting congress with a Monroe impersonator (a real one, as opposed to Russell's), before being let down by his dwindling member.<br /><br />Of course, Curtis once co-starred with the real Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot, and whose embrace he memorably described as like ""kissing Hitler"". As Roeg commented, ""Everything suddenly seemed connected... when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking.""

"It wasn't notable enough to be truly horrible, it was just incredibly lame. The story was not half bad, but the execution was just horrendous.<br /><br />To start with, it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on. It was just paced badly. The dialog was so utterly un-sparkling, just flat and boring.<br /><br />And the characters, cripes almightly, they made Deadpool boring. How the hell do you make Deadpool boring? He wasn't even funny. He wasn't crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly.<br /><br />Gambit was boring. And since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around, or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air? And what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist within the realm of physics. A round bo staff is not a helicopter blade, you cannot fly by twirling super-duper fast. Which Gambit wouldn't be able to do anyway. Nor Deadpool, especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography.<br /><br />And this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know WTH they are doing, and know better than to use it in every. single. shot. as a replacement for real fight choreography.<br /><br />Three of the most physical fighters in Marvel comics (Logan, Creed, and Wilson), and some of the worst fight choreography I have ever seen in recent film memory. It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys.<br /><br />And then you had the break out, with all these mutants who did nothing. Even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a Quicksilver nod), did f-all when they got out. Only Emma-really-lame-for-this-film-Frost and Cyclops did something.<br /><br />And since when was Logan so pretty? And the stupid, ""The bullet will take his memory away."" Don't you think Xavier and the X-Men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they X-rayed him in X1? I felt sorry for Liev Schrieber man, he actually brought in a good Sabretooth considering the script. He made one of Marvel's more simple super villains feel real. But he could not save the film from it's own epic lameness.<br /><br />Seriously, this was ""Daredevil"" level of suck.

"It seems Hal Hartley's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences. This film will be no exception to that rule. Fay Grim acts as a sequel to Hartley's 'Henry Foole' from 1998. The focus this time is on Henry's ex wife (played to perfection by the always welcome Parker Posey), who is being pestered by CIA goons about Henry's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings. In the interim of all of this, Fay ends up on an odyssey,dealing with international spies,etc. The film does get a bit bogged down in the second half. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is one not to be missed. For the novice Hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique, you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one (especially if you haven't seen 'Henry' yet). I admired the camera work,which at times reminded me of certain early Man Ray photography.",1,it seems hal hartleys films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences  this film will be no exception to that rule  fay grim acts as a sequel to hartleys henry foole from 1998  the focus this time is on henrys ex wife  played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey   who is being pestered by cia goons about henrys unpublished book about all of his shady dealings  in the interim of all of this  fay ends up on an odyssey dealing with international spies etc  the film does get a bit bogged down in the second half  if youve been a fan of hal hartley in the past  this is one not to be missed  for the novice hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique  you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one  especially if you havent seen henry yet   i admired the camera work which at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography 
"Basically this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns. Watching the Detectives has none of that.<br /><br />The premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads, not to mention the lack of any real visual story-telling style. I mean, this film is centered around MOVIES, yet is itself incredibly uncinematic! That's a major failing right there.<br /><br />But the main problem is we simply don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way. So the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem, well, not terribly interesting.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, another thing: For a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And the romance isn't terribly romantic, either.<br /><br />So avoid it. Even at its 90-something minute running time it's just not worth sitting through...",0,basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity  which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns  watching the detectives has none of that  the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored  thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads  not to mention the lack of any real visual story telling style  i mean  this film is centered around movies  yet is itself incredibly uncinematic  thats a major failing right there  but the main problem is we simply dont care about the main characters because the script and the actors  murphy and liu  fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way  so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem  well  not terribly interesting  oh  yeah  another thing  for a romantic comedy  its not funny  and the romance isnt terribly romantic  either  so avoid it  even at its 90 something minute running time its just not worth sitting through   
"CREEPSHOW 2 is the ill-fated sequel to the George Romero's (overrated) original, CREEPSHOW. Any sequel following a Romero film that's not directed by Romero himself has got some large shoes to fill, mostly because of the Romero fans out there who think he's God. I didn't care much for the first film and funny enough, I didn't care much for the sequel. The film series had so much potential but it was short-lived because both films were less than stellar. <br /><br />The biggest problem with CREEPSHOW 2 was that it only had three stories (excluding the in-between story), and because the first story sucked beyond belief, it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be *really* good. I saw CS 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner. Anything dramatic with George 'I can't act' Kennedy is automatically doomed and the Indian Statue story was too hokey and simply didn't belong in this sequel. So after a really trite and dull start, there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories weren't great enough for me to forget the first story. THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER are moderately successful, moderately because though the two other segments have their moments, they still sorta fall flat. The two last stories are basically stretched out for too long. It's not that I wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast, but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized, more erratic and with punchier endings. Also, if the two last stories hadn't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction, they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch. Having only three padded segments made for a boring feast.<br /><br />The acting and writing in both THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER segments are from awful to good. I like Lois Chiles in the last segment. It's probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as Bond Girl Holly Goodhead in MOONRAKER and in DEATH ON THE NILE. But even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story. Are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her? Are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker? If the hitchhiker's body was found by other people on the road, what was he when he attacked Chiles? Was he a ghost or a zombie or what? How did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack Chiles? The whole thing is not very clear, even for a supernatural story. And the ending is rather dull and uneventful.<br /><br />As for the infamous THE RAFT story, well, the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting. The characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves. None of the actors are convincing in their specific roles. Paul Satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock he's playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut. She seems too timid. The same could be said with the two others who play the ""plain"" teens. The idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed. There should have been a fifth character to the story, maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monster's alter ego of sorts. As creepy as the oil slick is, it doesn't make for a compelling ""character"". And the way the story ends, everything seems pointless. No punch to it whatsoever.<br /><br />Except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile, seeing CREEPSHOW 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time. CS 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen.",0,creepshow 2 is the ill fated sequel to the george romeros  overrated  original  creepshow  any sequel following a romero film thats not directed by romero himself has got some large shoes to fill  mostly because of the romero fans out there who think hes god  i didnt care much for the first film and funny enough  i didnt care much for the sequel  the film series had so much potential but it was short lived because both films were less than stellar   the biggest problem with creepshow 2 was that it only had three stories  excluding the in between story   and because the first story sucked beyond belief  it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be  really  good  i saw cs 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner  anything dramatic with george i cant act kennedy is automatically doomed and the indian statue story was too hokey and simply didnt belong in this sequel  so after a really trite and dull start  there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories werent great enough for me to forget the first story  the raft and the hitchhiker are moderately successful  moderately because though the two other segments have their moments  they still sorta fall flat  the two last stories are basically stretched out for too long  its not that i wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast  but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized  more erratic and with punchier endings  also  if the two last stories hadnt been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction  they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch  having only three padded segments made for a boring feast  the acting and writing in both the raft and the hitchhiker segments are from awful to good  i like lois chiles in the last segment  its probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as bond girl holly goodhead in moonraker and in death on the nile  but even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story  are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her  are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker  if the hitchhikers body was found by other people on the road  what was he when he attacked chiles  was he a ghost or a zombie or what  how did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack chiles  the whole thing is not very clear  even for a supernatural story  and the ending is rather dull and uneventful  as for the infamous the raft story  well  the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting  the characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves  none of the actors are convincing in their specific roles  paul satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock hes playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut  she seems too timid  the same could be said with the two others who play the  plain  teens  the idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed  there should have been a fifth character to the story  maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monsters alter ego of sorts  as creepy as the oil slick is  it doesnt make for a compelling  character   and the way the story ends  everything seems pointless  no punch to it whatsoever  except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile  seeing creepshow 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time  cs 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen 
"Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day, she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about the large apes, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger, Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla, also, as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. But, Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one, in the film, but he is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary, as befitting the earlier era of the story, and the settings and production values outstanding. But, most importantly, animals are here in abundance, not only Buddy, but the adorable chimps, the ducks, the rabbits, and so forth. For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven, here on earth, this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a great family film, will go ""ape"" over Buddy.",1,trudy lintz  rene russo  was one very fortunate lady many years ago  she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money  her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds  trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children  they dressed in clothes and had many amenities  one day  she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla  knowing nothing about the large apes  she relies on her husbands medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorillas life  once out of danger  trudy decides she will raise the gorilla  also  as one of her children  this works well for years and buddy  the gorilla  is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home  but  buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous  will trudy be able to keep buddy under control  for those who love animals  buddy is a must see movie  based on a true story  trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore  of course  buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one  in the film  but he is very close to seeming totally real  russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice  the costumes are exemplary  as befitting the earlier era of the story  and the settings and production values outstanding  but  most importantly  animals are here in abundance  not only buddy  but the adorable chimps  the ducks  the rabbits  and so forth  for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven  here on earth  this is a great movie choice  all animal lovers  and even those who just want to watch a great family film  will go  ape  over buddy 
"I have nothing more to say but it was awful. I cannot imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if certain actors don't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one seen that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think what was going on that was cut from the film. SHUDDER to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. Shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind. Like I stated before its a degrading mess. Its not even funny.

"Another silent love triangle film from Hitchcock, not a mystery, but very English, very well-paced and photographed. Smooth boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits circus boxer ""One Round"" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep the pretty but fickle Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are lots of character actors and grotesquesat Jack and Mabel's wedding the verger, standing in the aisle of the church, registers shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men, the fat lady, the conjoined twins who, of course, argue about which side of the aisle to sit, and the wedding feast is amusing. The rest of the movie has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to her heart, or something like that. It was another era altogether, with the audience in evening dress, and the boxers dressing up, too, when out of the ring. The camera angles, the pace, the use of symbols, the cuttingall very stylish and masterful. The camera-work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping. Brisson's good looks are well-used in this one; his smiling is not so oblivious of what's going on around him as he is in Hitchcock's The Manxman, and so is not annoying. But can boxers have such dimples?",1,another silent love triangle film from hitchcock  not a mystery  but very english  very well paced and photographed  smooth boxer bob corby  ian hunter  recruits circus boxer  one round  jack sander  carl brisson  to be his sparring partner  partly to keep the pretty but fickle mabel  lilian hall davis  nearby  there are lots of character actors and grotesquesat jack and mabels wedding the verger  standing in the aisle of the church  registers shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men  the fat lady  the conjoined twins who  of course  argue about which side of the aisle to sit  and the wedding feast is amusing  the rest of the movie has jack losing mabel and boxing his way back to her heart  or something like that  it was another era altogether  with the audience in evening dress  and the boxers dressing up  too  when out of the ring  the camera angles  the pace  the use of symbols  the cuttingall very stylish and masterful  the camera work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping  brissons good looks are well used in this one  his smiling is not so oblivious of whats going on around him as he is in hitchcocks the manxman  and so is not annoying  but can boxers have such dimples 
"Now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly I'm appalled. For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to. Let me tell u something. I started watching many T.V shows like Lost, Prison Break, Dexter, Deadwood and even Invasion. But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season. Then we have The Sopranos. I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season, and more importantly all of its episodes. There is no department that this show doesn't excel in. Acting- Nothing short of superb. James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would've been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony. The raw emotion he displays is superb. Then we have everyone else, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco, Dominic Chianese (whom i remembered as Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part 2) and my personal two favourite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie 'Walnuts' Gualtieri and Silvio Dante. All of these actors perform to the best quality, and all giving an excellent performance in each episode. Then we have the story, never have i been so sucked into a T.V show before. The story is nothing short of excellent. Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic. I feel that The Sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of. Its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence, but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television, and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show. Not just say its too violent, or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral, i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day, i don't think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to God. I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you'll be hooked from the very first episode, i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show, hooked on it. Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on T.V. After you've watched the first season, you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television, and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.",1,now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly im appalled  for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then im afraid i dont know what the world has come to  let me tell u something  i started watching many t v shows like lost  prison break  dexter  deadwood and even invasion  but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season  especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season  then we have the sopranos  i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season  and more importantly all of its episodes  there is no department that this show doesnt excel in  acting  nothing short of superb  james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode  after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it wouldve been the better choice  however after watching the first few episodes  i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony  the raw emotion he displays is superb  then we have everyone else  edie falco  michael imperioli  lorraine bracco  dominic chianese  whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2  and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie walnuts gualtieri and silvio dante  all of these actors perform to the best quality  and all giving an excellent performance in each episode  then we have the story  never have i been so sucked into a t v show before  the story is nothing short of excellent  each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic  i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of  its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence  but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television  and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show  not just say its too violent  or they feel that the character of tony is immoral  i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day  i dont think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god  i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me  youll be hooked from the very first episode  i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show  hooked on it  trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t v  after youve watched the first season  youll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television  and no t v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos 
"Since was only a toddler when this show originally aired I just recently picked up the DVD set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed. This show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's TV series ""X-Files""- but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach. But don't get me wrong, some of these episodes have full on horror themes, many in which have some pretty greuesome plots (left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television).<br /><br />Some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting, but that is the charm and attraction to this series. Whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi/horror themes, this series brought all that together. Each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so (1 hour with commercials) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more.

"SPLIT SECOND might have been a good movie.

"You can call it a mystery, perhaps a small thriller, or an intelligent film.<br /><br />The story takes you through the life of one person who has lost his life and is looking to regain it.<br /><br />I have to say I was quite surprised that I truly did enjoy this film. It is not usually the genre I care for however the characters quickly became people to me and I wanted to know what they were about and what was going to happen to them.<br /><br />Just like many french films over English made, we are able to learn much more about the character and the affect of their surroundings on their person.

"SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Not really a very good movie... but I did like the idea behind it... and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with. The movie is ostensibly an ""episode"" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off ""danger zone"" and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune... everyone else just winds up dead. The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad. None of the ""real"" people seem real at all. The actors playing the killers are kind of fun... because they are portraying cheesy and over-the-top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types... and that's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show. The movie pretends to be done all in one take... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the ""danger zone"" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly (to hide the ""cuts"" from one take to another, I would imagine).",0,slashers  2 outta 5 stars  not really a very good movie    but i did like the idea behind it    and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with  the movie is ostensibly an  episode  of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off  danger zone  and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them  the survivor  if there is one  wins fame and fortune    everyone else just winds up dead  the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad  none of the  real  people seem real at all  the actors playing the killers are kind of fun    because they are portraying cheesy and over the top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types    and thats exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show  the movie pretends to be done all in one take    there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the  danger zone  and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera    but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly  to hide the  cuts  from one take to another  i would imagine  
"A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.<br /><br />I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.",0,a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town  cats and death soon follow them  that about sums it up  ill admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie  but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film  and believe me there is plenty of that to go around  it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience  the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on  fear  greed  pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people  although it can be argued that that seeming failing  in actuality  serves the telling of the story  the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not that i have anything specific against mr  king  are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work  makeup and quite suitable music  the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady  the otherworldly mother  king manages to take a simple story of outsider  or people who are a little different okay   a lot in this case   trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan 
"I must admit I burst out laughing when I saw one reviewer compare this to LOTR. Well yes, if you exclude the dwarfs, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the classy direction and everything else. Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a $20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk.<br /><br />As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.<br /><br />I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to walk dogs?",0,i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr  well yes  if you exclude the dwarfs  the cast of thousands  the great special effects  the big battles  the strong characterization  the decent plot  the good acting  the classy direction and everything else  which leaves you with the walking  and boy  does this film do walking  if mr piano had his way  this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside  but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble  youve never seen so much walking in a movie  if this really had a  20m budget  most of it must have gone on mr pianos shoes  because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does  which explains why theres no money left for decent effects  a decent video camera or proper actors  honestly  its like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes  even on fast forward  this is a looonnnggg walk  as for the sci fi stuff  i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film  they only get in the way of the walking  which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story  i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs 
"My Tutor Friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to My Sassy Girl.. there's no kissing/sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions. Sex is not always required in a good romantic movie.<br /><br />The movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon CG scenes blended into the movie. I like the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience.<br /><br />Mao points: 8/10",1,my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl   theres no kissing sex scenes  hollywood should learn more from korean productions  sex is not always required in a good romantic movie  the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie  i like the part when ji hoon almost kissed su wan  the funniest moment is when ji hoon punched su wans first love because he dumped su wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon  how he became a father was revealed in the next scene  which brings smiles to the audience  mao points  8 10
"This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the very start I was utterly hooked into the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a superb character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape, to the superlative performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 10/10",1,this is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement  from the very start i was utterly hooked into the  true  story when lt  viktor burakov  stephan rea  weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the childrens bodies  this then is the compelling story of andrei chikatilo  wonderfully played by jeffrey demunn  the green mile   in fact  he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him  until we remember what he is  the psychiatrist dr  alexandr bukhanovsky  wonderfully played by max von sydow was utterly believable in every detail  and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the soviet union  is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local communist commissar bondarchuk played by joss ackland  for me though  the outstanding performance was from donald sutherland  proving once again what a superb character actor he really is  i was almost in tears when he told burakov how the fbi had so closely followed and admired his work  this film puts silence of the lambs into the shade  from the atmospheric and bleak soviet landscape  to the superlative performances by everyone involved   i rate this film 10 10
"I was p***ed when I couldn't see this one when it was screening at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that it was going to be on cable tonight, I put it on remind as soon as I could. So was it worth the wait? Well let's backtrack a tad as I have yet to give you the plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray totally hammered asks Sean to off the guy that they had Sean following around. And it goes on from there. Which leads me back to the question posed. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the buildup was pretty good and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it.

"I jotted down a few notes here on THE FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell-fest ...<br /><br />1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison. I only hope that he can find Armani prison wear to go off in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in $4500 designer overcoats, a $7300 designer silk suit, and seeing his $3500/month Los Angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh.<br /><br />2) Leading lady Tracey Phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed, and amazing breasts that are hi-lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to Satan. At least back in the 1970's our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them, though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination. By the final 10 minutes of the movie all I could think about is what her breasts probably would look like.<br /><br />3) Professional Psychics living in Los Angeles can afford $4 million dollar condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide that he was roughing it. As a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR., which at least had the good sense to make it's condo resident a successful movie director. The only Professional Psychics I have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud.<br /><br />4) I forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his ""How's it going', Buddy Boy?"" line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since ""THANKS FOR THE RIDE, LADY!!"" from CREEPSHOW 2.<br /><br />5) Underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit Zippo lighter into them, which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous. And since Zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing, the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your $7300 Gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous.<br /><br />6) The stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal BOMB ratings from critics when released.<br /><br />7) Movie satanists always amaze me: Here is a guy who has tapped into some Luciferian bid for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him, he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people's apartments. Speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible, can fly, and is able to put his being inside of other people's bodies -- and yet he obliges star Lou Diamond Phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film's conclusion, yet does not have the good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to ensure that he wins.<br /><br />And on and on ... To be watched in the company of wise-cracking friends while consuming beer. You'll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously.<br /><br />4/10",0,i jotted down a few notes here on the first power  lou lambada diamond phillips 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell fest     1  lou diamond phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison  i only hope that he can find armani prison wear to go off in style with  one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in  4500 designer overcoats  a  7300 designer silk suit  and seeing his  3500 month los angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by mies van der roeh  2  leading lady tracey phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin  flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed  and amazing breasts that are hi lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan  at least back in the 1970s our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them  though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination  by the final 10 minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look like  3  professional psychics living in los angeles can afford  4 million dollar condos on mullholland drive overlooking los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was roughing it  as a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynchs mullholland dr   which at least had the good sense to make its condo resident a successful movie director  the only professional psychics i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud  4  i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful  and his  hows it going  buddy boy   line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since  thanks for the ride  lady    from creepshow 2  5  underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit zippo lighter into them  which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous  and since zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing  the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your  7300 gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous  6  the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least  and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released  7  movie satanists always amaze me  here is a guy who has tapped into some luciferian bid for power  and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him  he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of peoples apartments  speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible  can fly  and is able to put his being inside of other peoples bodies    and yet he obliges star lou diamond phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the films conclusion  yet does not have the good sense to inhabit arnold schwartzeneggar or apollo creed to ensure that he wins  and on and on     to be watched in the company of wise cracking friends while consuming beer  youll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously  4 10
"Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it ""only happening in the movies"" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.",0,tierneys an authentic tough guy  but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn  the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner  just count the times tierneys incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts  the old cliché about it  only happening in the movies  applies here in spades  then theres the guy playing the watchman  who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy  ruining the menacing mood in the process  the static one room sets dont help either  and neither does director feists obvious lack of feel for the material  then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay off  and the results are pretty flat  in fact the movie only picks up in the station house scenes where hard bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent looking gas station attendants  too bad that tieneys career never really gelled  i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another  his ice cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough guy best  anyway this project might have worked as a radio play  but as a movie with a promising noir title  its a disappointment 
"I saw this gem of a film at Cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight.<br /><br />Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun throughout, with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off. It's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison he meets a `lifer' who tells him of `the ultimate bellini'  which to you and me  is a sure-fire get rich quick scheme. It turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop  which could net millions. Sounds simple?  well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride!!  word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on Cosimos `bellini' lead by failed boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell  surely a star in the making) and reluctant crook Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud!!.<br /><br />Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna street) which also inspired a similar film to `Collinwood'  `Palookaville'. This knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the Russo brothers it definitely has shades of the Coen Brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker.",1,i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight  welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb  great fun throughout  with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off  its a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook  cosimo  played by luis guzman  who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison  while in prison he meets a  lifer who tells him of  the ultimate bellini  which to you and me  is a sure fire get rich quick scheme  it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop  which could net millions  sounds simple   well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride    word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos  bellini lead by failed boxer pero  superbly played by sam rockwell  surely a star in the making  and reluctant crook riley  william h  macy  who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud    based on the italian film i soliti ignoti  big deal on madonna street  which also inspired a similar film to  collinwood   palookaville  this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the coen brothers about it  produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney  who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker 
"Anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of Elk Hills. The town elders deputize tough, cagey Vietnam veteran Aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by Kris Kristofferson) and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place. The plan goes sour when Aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over Elk Hills after they get rid of all the bad elements. It's up to Aaron's decent do-gooder brother Ben (amiably played by Jan-Michael Vincent) to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand. Writer/director George (""Miami Blues,"" ""Gross Pointe Blank"") Armitage whips up a delightfully amoral, cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive-in exploitation contemporary Western winner: he expertly creates a gritty, no-nonsense tone, keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout, and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb (the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring). The first-rate cast of familiar B-feature faces constitutes as a major asset: Victoria Principal as Ben's sweet hottie girlfriend Linda, the fabulous Bernadette Peters as flaky saloon singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as the feckless mayor, David Doyle as a slimy bank president, Andrew Stevens as an affable gas station attendant, John Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as one of the 'Nam vets, Anthony Carbone as a smarmy casino manager, John Steadman as a folksy old diner owner, Paul Gleason as a mean strong-arm shakedown bully, and Dick Miller as a talentless piano player. Moral: Don't hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjager's slick cinematography, Gerald Fried's lively, harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score, and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy.",1,anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of elk hills  the town elders deputize tough  cagey vietnam veteran aaron  a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by kris kristofferson  and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place  the plan goes sour when aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over elk hills after they get rid of all the bad elements  its up to aarons decent do gooder brother ben  amiably played by jan michael vincent  to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand  writer director george   miami blues    gross pointe blank   armitage whips up a delightfully amoral  cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive in exploitation contemporary western winner  he expertly creates a gritty  no nonsense tone  keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout  and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb  the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring   the first rate cast of familiar b feature faces constitutes as a major asset  victoria principal as bens sweet hottie girlfriend linda  the fabulous bernadette peters as flaky saloon singer little dee  brad dexter as the feckless mayor  david doyle as a slimy bank president  andrew stevens as an affable gas station attendant  john carpenter movie regular charles cyphers as one of the nam vets  anthony carbone as a smarmy casino manager  john steadman as a folksy old diner owner  paul gleason as a mean strong arm shakedown bully  and dick miller as a talentless piano player  moral  dont hire other people to do your dirty work  william cronjagers slick cinematography  gerald frieds lively  harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score  and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy 
"Don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series. It is a six hour bore, an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It is a dry, boring, drawn out, and uninspired as they come. And it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency.

"Few films have left me with such a feeling of unease, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (How it ended there I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 mn of hateful, derivative garbage, the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie ""Don't answer the phone"" - but worse. The nastiness of it all, rape and all, is shown without any distance (unlike strong stuff like ""Last house on the left"") and utter contempt for the (perfect ?) victims and everybody involved, leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur. At the end I felt like taking a shower.

"This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly, Gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach, a drunken, diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson, an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. Of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into Linda Marolla, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father.<br /><br />The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty, acidic turn as Hobson, Arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role, Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation.<br /><br />A pre-""LA Law"" Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passive-aggressive note, while Barney Martin (Jerry's dad on ""Seinfeld"") steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated, overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately, the 1997 DVD, certainly in need of remastering, has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.",1,this 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud  sadly  gordon  only in his early forties  died soon after completing this  his only feature film  its an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible  it plays almost like a 1930s style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes  the plot centers on arthur bach  a drunken  diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his  750 million inheritance if he doesnt marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson  an heiress handpicked by his old money father and dotty grandmother  of course  he doesnt love her and by chance  runs into linda marolla  a working class waitress  and of course  aspiring actress  after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her father  the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by moore  that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielguds feisty  acidic turn as hobson  arthurs devoted but reality grounded valet  its the type of role he could play in his sleep  but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings  in probably her most likable film role  liza minnelli hands the picture to her male co stars by toning down her usual razzle dazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation  a pre  la law  jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passive aggressive note  while barney martin  jerrys dad on  seinfeld   steals all his scenes as lindas slovenly father ralph  the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald  who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother  and i have to admit that i still cant stand the very dated  overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that years best song  unfortunately  the 1997 dvd  certainly in need of remastering  has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes

"_Waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully. From the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality, masculinity and depression, the experience of disability is laid open.<br /><br />The diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined - Joel, the writer, Raymond, the black man with a murky past, and Bloss, the racist biker. At first, these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries, but retain their competitive spirit. Over time, shared experience, both good and bad, brings them together as friends to support one another.<br /><br />Most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by Joel, who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses, headphones and curtains. As he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life, Joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward.<br /><br />The dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one's head above water; to give up the dance is to reject life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.",1, waterdance  explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully  from the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality  masculinity and depression  the experience of disability is laid open  the diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined   joel  the writer  raymond  the black man with a murky past  and bloss  the racist biker  at first  these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries  but retain their competitive spirit  over time  shared experience  both good and bad  brings them together as friends to support one another  most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by joel  who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses  headphones and curtains  as he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life  joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward  the dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep ones head above water  to give up the dance is to reject life   waterdance  is a moving and powerful film on many levels  and i do not hesitate to recommend it

"This utterly dull, senseless, pointless, spiritless, and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post-""Trainspotting"" movies: ""The Beach"" already took care of that. What this low-budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs, booze, ego, self-delusion, bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once-promising director's quick demise.<br /><br />The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper, likely) meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit-making duo - which they become. A friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video-camera by which he films them in ""action"", and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage. Now, I know that the UK in recent years has put out incredible junk, but this is ridiculous; the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles. During the studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - change lyrics in every take and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it, and quite absurdly they do take it. Not only is the music total and utter trash, but its ""performers"" are anti-social; these NEWCOMERS are supposed to be calling the shots. It's just too dumb. It's plain awful.<br /><br />The dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere, and this rags-to-bitches story has no point and makes no sense. It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of trash is so bad it's embarrassing to watch. Ecclestone's I.Q. also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense.

"I've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time, and while this isn't the worst of the bunch, it's certainly in the lower half. The script starts off OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife. Cute huh? The movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. Turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's harvesting people's souls. It's the job of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs, do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out, and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects. At this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid, I was begging for it to be over. There was still an hour to go. It looked like a half an hour ""Tales From the Crypt"" episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap-fest. From Tiny Lister doing his best John Coffey (The Green Mile) impersonation to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet, this movie fails in every possible level. I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reason. 1) His fiancé is pretty hot, she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2) The movie actually looks OK, a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal-mart quality home cameras.<br /><br />In the end, avoid this turd even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As a bonus drinking game, you and your buddies take a shot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking.

"Offering a killer combo of terrible writing, terrible acting and terrible direction, it's a tossup whether Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad. It's almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest, seediest Cannon film. As if a glance at a cast list including characters like 'Lesbian Pedophile,' 'Perverted Gentleman,' 'Porno Actress' weren't enough, it's your only chance to see Charles Bronson's cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo - but don't worry, it's okay, as the offscreen screams make clear he's only torturing him for information. After all, even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice Catholic daughter, he's a nice Catholic cop who regularly brings local Catholic priest William O'Connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice - or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine. But then that's what you get for telling him ""Look, I think you're a little bit unstable."" Still, when later offered a bribe, he may snarl ""I'd like to shove this up your ass, but I don't want to get my hands dirty,"" he's clearly learned where to draw the line: instead, he just makes him eat a $25,000 watch and sets fire to his Cadillac. The anal obsession even follows through to the film's title: despite the poster featuring a naked Japanese girl on a porn film set, the film's only direct example of Kinjite/forbidden subjects, as Alex Hyde White's English teacher explains to a group of Japanese businessmen, is, er talking about your bowel movements in polite society.<br /><br />Bronson isn't just too old for this, as the opening fight makes only too clear, he's too old for love interest Peggy Lipton, and she looks old enough to have grown-up kids. A better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material, here's he's given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks. When he's not widening the circles of suspects he's accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings. He's definitely not a P.C. copper, with a special loathing for the Japanese - as if it wasn't bad enough that they're buying up American businesses, what's worse, they double-park on a public thoroughfare! No racial minority goes unassaulted, be they black pimp or Pakistani hotel clerk, no cop cliché unrecycled, be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner (Perry Lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye that's so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own). The twin plot strands - Bronson's L.A. cop trying to take down Juan Hernandez's pimp who deals in underage girls and James Pax's porn-obsessed Japanese businessman  take forever to intertwine, and then in the most unlikely of ways: after copping a feel of Bronson's daughter on a bus (""Some Oriental guy touched my holy of holies!""), in the film's idea of poetic justice Pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by Hernandez. You half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say, ""How d'ya like them apples?""<br /><br />Somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is, but the execution is pure Rising Sun: the Archie Bunker Version, shot like out-takes from an R-rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot-'em-up-and-blow'em-up finale that sees a small army of machine-gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count. The last of Bronson's mostly bad to in different collaborations with J. Lee Thompson  and sadly Thompson's last film as director - it's a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to.",0,offering a killer combo of terrible writing  terrible acting and terrible direction  its a tossup whether kinjite  forbidden subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad  its almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest  seediest cannon film  as if a glance at a cast list including characters like lesbian pedophile  perverted gentleman  porno actress werent enough  its your only chance to see charles bronsons cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo   but dont worry  its okay  as the offscreen screams make clear hes only torturing him for information  after all  even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice catholic daughter  hes a nice catholic cop who regularly brings local catholic priest william oconnell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice   or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine  but then thats what you get for telling him  look  i think youre a little bit unstable   still  when later offered a bribe  he may snarl  id like to shove this up your ass  but i dont want to get my hands dirty   hes clearly learned where to draw the line  instead  he just makes him eat a  25 000 watch and sets fire to his cadillac  the anal obsession even follows through to the films title  despite the poster featuring a naked japanese girl on a porn film set  the films only direct example of kinjite forbidden subjects  as alex hyde whites english teacher explains to a group of japanese businessmen  is  er talking about your bowel movements in polite society  bronson isnt just too old for this  as the opening fight makes only too clear  hes too old for love interest peggy lipton  and she looks old enough to have grown up kids  a better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material  heres hes given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks  when hes not widening the circles of suspects hes accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings  hes definitely not a p c  copper  with a special loathing for the japanese   as if it wasnt bad enough that theyre buying up american businesses  whats worse  they double park on a public thoroughfare  no racial minority goes unassaulted  be they black pimp or pakistani hotel clerk  no cop cliché unrecycled  be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner  perry lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye thats so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own   the twin plot strands   bronsons l a  cop trying to take down juan hernandezs pimp who deals in underage girls and james paxs porn obsessed japanese businessman  take forever to intertwine  and then in the most unlikely of ways  after copping a feel of bronsons daughter on a bus   some oriental guy touched my holy of holies     in the films idea of poetic justice pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by hernandez  you half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say   how dya like them apples   somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is  but the execution is pure rising sun  the archie bunker version  shot like out takes from an r rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot em up and blowem up finale that sees a small army of machine gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count  the last of bronsons mostly bad to in different collaborations with j  lee thompson  and sadly thompsons last film as director   its a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to

"Well, you'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish, bland, and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like. Set in Tunis, mom piddles around the flat, gets antsy, and decides, albeit reluctantly (she just can't help herself), to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer. This film is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles, fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking (they walk everywhere) and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring, uneventful, low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits.

"Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in August of 1939. So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.<br /><br />The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.<br /><br />Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.<br /><br />Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.<br /><br />Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.<br /><br />The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Davis's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist background. <br /><br />His suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.<br /><br />Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.<br /><br />Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.<br /><br />Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other anti-fascist classic, Casablanca. <br /><br />Though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern anti-fascist message that bears repeating infinitely.",1,watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non aggression pact signed in august of 1939  so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line  the line didnt change until a couple of months later  lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work  the play watch on the rhine ran from april 1941 to february 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler  eric roberts as the youngest son  lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas  lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an oscar  a golden globe  and the new york film critics for best actor  probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well  the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against  humphrey bogart for casablanca  gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls  mickey rooney in the human comedy  and walter pidgeon for madame curie  every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was  lukass nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field  jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukass wife was given to bette davis  davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her  but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it  its the same reason she did the man who came to dinner  a much lighter play than this one  davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days  after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe  davis lukas  and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war  theyre made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren  the fly in this ointment are some other house guests  a friend of daviss from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe  a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris  coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukass anti fascist background   his suspicions are quite correct  its the reason that the family has been the vagabonds theyve become  lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there  his health has not been the same since  his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes  those decisions affect all the other members of the cast  adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellmans significant other  coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell  kurt katch  clyde fillmore  erwin kalser and rudolph anders  coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count  he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad  lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in 1943  but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls  dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti fascist classic  casablanca   though its an item firmly planted in those specific times  watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti fascist message that bears repeating infinitely 
"I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.<br /><br />I was a youngster at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The entire world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on each day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moon liftoff, all the way to splashdown, in a multitude of languages. In school, some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV. During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate. You couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was. The world was truly one community. <br /><br />Now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down.

"Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production, BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any ""cliffhanger"" list, utterly lacking the style, imagination, and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor, BATMAN.<br /><br />The producer, Sam Katzman, was known as ""King of the Quickies"" and, like his director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement. (Unfortunately, this team also produced the two Superman serials, starring Kirk Alyn, with their tacky flying animation, canned music, and dull supporting players.) The opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come: thoroughly inane titles (""Robin Rescues Batman,"" ""Batman vs Wizard""), mechanical music droning on, and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around, either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap Halloween masks. Batman's cowl, with its devil's horns and eagle's beak, fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes. His ""utility belt"" is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments, from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments!<br /><br />In any case, the lead players are miscast. Robert Lowery displays little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman. He creates the impression that he'd rather be somewhere, anywhere else! John Duncan, as Robin, has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue. He is too old for the part, with an even older stuntman filling in for him. Out of costume, Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink, without one ounce of the chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 serial.<br /><br />Although serials were not known for character development, the earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast. This one offers a group going through the motions, not that the filmmakers provide much support. Not one of the hoodlums stands out, and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever, ""The Wizard."" (Great name!) Actually, they are led by someone sporting a curtain, a shawl, and a sack over his head, with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing. The ""prime suspects"" -- an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying.<br /><br />Even the established comic book ""regulars"" are superfluous. It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the perils she faces, Vicki displays virtually no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is none-too-bright. Unlike in the previous serial, Alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is ""Mr Wayne's residence."" They are props for a drawn-out, gimmick-laden, incoherent plot, further saddled with uninspired, repetitive music and amateurish production design. The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom, the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel. The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing. (The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!)<br /><br />Pity that the filmmakers couldn't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure. While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious ""Batfan,"" one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box. They capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined.<br /><br />Now for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version!",0,granting the budget and time constraints of serial production  batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any  cliffhanger  list  utterly lacking the style  imagination  and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor  batman  the producer  sam katzman  was known as  king of the quickies  and  like his director  spencer bennett  seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement   unfortunately  this team also produced the two superman serials  starring kirk alyn  with their tacky flying animation  canned music  and dull supporting players   the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come  thoroughly inane titles   robin rescues batman    batman vs wizard    mechanical music droning on  and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around  either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks  batmans cowl  with its devils horns and eagles beak  fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes  his  utility belt  is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments  from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments  in any case  the lead players are miscast  robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne  and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman  he creates the impression that hed rather be somewhere  anywhere else  john duncan  as robin  has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue  he is too old for the part  with an even older stuntman filling in for him  out of costume  lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink  without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serial  although serials were not known for character development  the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast  this one offers a group going through the motions  not that the filmmakers provide much support  not one of the hoodlums stands out  and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever   the wizard    great name   actually  they are led by someone sporting a curtain  a shawl  and a sack over his head  with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing  the  prime suspects     an eccentric professor  a radio broadcaster    are simply annoying  even the established comic book  regulars  are superfluous  it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne  despite the perils she faces  vicki displays virtually no emotion  commissioner gordon is none too bright  unlike in the previous serial  alfred the butler is a mere walk on whose most important line is  mr waynes residence   they are props for a drawn out  gimmick laden  incoherent plot  further saddled with uninspired  repetitive music and amateurish production design  the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle class home in any sitcom  the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel  the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing   the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet   pity that the filmmakers couldnt invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure  while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious  batfan   one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box  they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combined  now for the good news    this is not the 1997 version 
"in one of Neil Simon's best plays. Creaky, cranky ex-Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are teaming up for a TV comedy special.

"""Moonstruck"" is a movie that I liked the first time I watched it. I really liked it the second time. I loved it the third time. Now it is one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />The humor is subtle but really good. The film offers a lot of warmth humor. the story takes place in a old school Italian neighborhood in NYC. Cher's search for love is enjoyable to watch. This film is, by far, the best job Nicholas Cage has done on film. The old man character is fantastic. He lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. But, perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis.<br /><br />The film's climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and wrap up.",1, moonstruck  is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it  i really liked it the second time  i loved it the third time  now it is one of my all time favorites  the humor is subtle but really good  the film offers a lot of warmth humor  the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc  chers search for love is enjoyable to watch  this film is  by far  the best job nicholas cage has done on film  the old man character is fantastic  he lights up the screen without saying a word  the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic  but  perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakis  the films climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen  exceptional direction and wrap up 
"I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene. He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.<br /><br />Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie. He is just inspired.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. He has some really cool lines though.<br /><br />About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good.

"I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary ""edginess"" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.",1,i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers  i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot   i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared  yet i remember it pretty well  with a nice twist or two  and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm  michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career  and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead  i definitely recommend it as a rental  although some of the themes  which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989  now may seem tame  which is a shame  considering that contemporary  edginess  is often just used as a necessary marketing tool  sort of like clamoring just to get noticed 
"I must give How She Move a near-perfect rating because the content is truly great. As a previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this film has found itself in IMDBs bottom 100 list! That's absolutely ridiculous! Other films--particular those that share the dance theme--can't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top-notch, believable acting, and amazing dance routines.<br /><br />From start to finish the underlying story (this is not just about winning a competition) is very easy to delve into, and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this are 2-dimensional by any means and, by the end of the film, it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And, even if you're not the crying type, you might get a little weepy-eyed before the credits roll.) <br /><br />I definitely recommend this film to dance-lovers and, even more so, to those who can appreciate a poignant and well-acted storyline. How She Move isn't perfect of course (what film is?), but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and/or characters who lack substance. The actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers!",1,i must give how she move a near perfect rating because the content is truly great  as a previous reviewer commented  i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list  thats absolutely ridiculous  other films  particular those that share the dance theme  cant hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top notch  believable acting  and amazing dance routines  from start to finish the underlying story  this is not just about winning a competition  is very easy to delve into  and surprisingly realistic  none of the main characters in this are 2 dimensional by any means and  by the end of the film  its very easy to feel emotionally invested in them   and  even if youre not the crying type  you might get a little weepy eyed before the credits roll    i definitely recommend this film to dance lovers and  even more so  to those who can appreciate a poignant and well acted storyline  how she move isnt perfect of course  what film is    but its definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half baked plot and or characters who lack substance  the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers 
"This film is really bad. It maybe harsh, but it is. It really is. Poor script, every vampire cliché in the book is used, and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... i.e. ole Dracula. There have been some truly brilliant Dracula/vampire movies in the past, but this doesn't even make it into the ""dire"" slot.<br /><br />Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move, add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious/surreal day-dreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a film - Dracula 2000.<br /><br />I really cannot find any good things to say about this movie, as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent ... Whats the problem with that I hear you cry ... Well, he is English, but he sounds like an American trying to do an English accent.<br /><br />All in all you may as well say your money (if you were thinking of buying it), or rent it out, watch it, and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the Tellytubbies.<br /><br />P.S.

"For some reason, in the late 70's and early 80's the local CBS affiliated station in New York kept playing this movie in it's late-night slot on Friday or Saturday nights for several years, usually at 2 a.m. or some such time. It's a fitting movie for that time slot since it's really hard to follow and quite odd (see the other reviews for specific story info). Anyway, after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV (And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming), I kept catching this little oddity. After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it is only available (from every search i've conducted anyway)in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label ""Brentwood Video"" as part of a 4-pack of movies (4 movies on 2 double sided discs)called ""Alien Worlds"" if anyone is interested. It's usually available for around $10-but even much less if you shop around. The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies, so no need to comment on them here. But I haven't seen ""Eyes"" available anywhere else. Though hardly a ""restored"" version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once IMDb's stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct. Even with the 92 minute running time it's not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed. It seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story. Would a longer version make in any less confusing? Who really knows-unless you've seen it in it's native language... By the way, my attempts to watch this during the day don't work and I end up just turning it off.

"Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German-TV adaptaion of his classic play. It's obvious that very little money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set. The movie was ineptly dubbed into English, with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway?

"The history of the FBI, as told from the point of view of Agent Stewart via flashbacks, interwoven with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as is Hamilton as an earnest agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who's who cast of gangsters. Some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's daughter's school sequence). Overall, it goes on way too long. Nevertheless, it's worth a look for its handsome production values.",1,the history of the fbi  as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks  interwoven with his personal life story  stewart and miles  as his wife  are pretty good  as is hamilton as an earnest agent  the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved  its like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a whos who cast of gangsters  some of the episodes are too long  some too short  and some just look out of place  stewarts daughters school sequence   overall  it goes on way too long  nevertheless  its worth a look for its handsome production values 
"Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production. I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing. Whilst James Stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance, and the supporting cast are magnificent, it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was. Her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best. Watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take - breathtaking.",1,every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production  i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made  everyone involved is perfect  script  acting  direction  sets and editing  whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance  and the supporting cast are magnificent  it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was  her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve  lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best  watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take   breathtaking 
"Okay, let's face it. this is a god-awful movie. The plot (such as it is) is horrible, the acting worse. But the movie was made for one reason and one reason only, like all of those awful Mario Lanza movies...just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in his prime. Okay, so maybe the Lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women, but this movie is about hearing Luciano. That alone is worth watching the movie. A big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and belts out a lot of hit numbers, too.<br /><br />I must admit I'm prejudiced on a number of levels. I'm Italian. I'm a big Pavarotti fan (is there anything about Pavarotti that isn't big, including his fan base?). And when I first saw this movie I was going out on my own, seeing the height and depth of Life's possibilities and in love for the first time. So as awful as this movie is, the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again.<br /><br />Yes, it's corny and awful. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it's all about. So I give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he is now gone. Like Italian food that you've never tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep.",1,okay  lets face it  this is a god awful movie  the plot  such as it is  is horrible  the acting worse  but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only  like all of those awful mario lanza movies   just to hear the voice of the star  in this case pavarotti in his prime  okay  so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women  but this movie is about hearing luciano  that alone is worth watching the movie  a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears  finds humility and love along the way  and belts out a lot of hit numbers  too  i must admit im prejudiced on a number of levels  im italian  im a big pavarotti fan  is there anything about pavarotti that isnt big  including his fan base    and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own  seeing the height and depth of lifes possibilities and in love for the first time  so as awful as this movie is  the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again  yes  its corny and awful  but the voice is immortal and timeless  and the voice is what its all about  so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love  especially since he is now gone  like italian food that youve never tried before  try it  you may be pleasantly surprised  as a luciano lover or prospective pavarotti peep 
"Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin's directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. Unlike Harlin's ""Elm Street 4"", and ""Die Hard 2"" which I really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie. That, my friends, is a script. The dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful, but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. There are so many awful lines in this movie, I don't even want to have to remember any of them. Not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. It's almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script. Wrong again.<br /><br />The sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. Stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around Lithgow, Turner, and the worst of the bunch Rooker, there is something wrong with this picture. Lithgow played one of the best villains in ""Ricochet"", yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here. How is that possible? I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance. Turner's part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. Michael Rooker CAN act. I know this because I have witnessed it in ""Days of Thunder"", but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards. Has it come to this? When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. Unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.<br /><br />Which brings me back to Harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. It's his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act. The script is not very good, but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. I don't care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting. <br /><br />Plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off. The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but I really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene. If the bad guy's would have won early, maybe I wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever!",0,let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlins directing style  for the most part  and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots  unlike harlins  elm street 4   and  die hard 2  which i really liked  there is something that is missing from this movie  that  my friends  is a script  the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful  but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity  there are so many awful lines in this movie  i dont even want to have to remember any of them  not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure  its almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said  they could improve the script  wrong again  the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue  stallone has never been a favorite of mine  but when he is acting circles around lithgow  turner  and the worst of the bunch rooker  there is something wrong with this picture  lithgow played one of the best villains in  ricochet   yet comes across as someone who cant act to save his life here  how is that possible  ive always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone  who himself still phoned in his performance  turners part is so small and pointless  but she still manages to appear lost on screen  michael rooker can act  i know this because i have witnessed it in  days of thunder   but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards  has it come to this  when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking  i just wanted the movie to end right there  or have them both amazingly find their acting ability  unfortunately  neither of those things occurred  which brings me back to harlin  who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters  its his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all  because he should have made the people actually act  the script is not very good  but still the actors performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director  i dont care how much was paid for the special effects  which for the most part are good  you still cant just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting   plus  the pacing of this movie seems to be off  the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done  but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all  i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene  but i really didnt care if they got the money or not in that scene  if the bad guys would have won early  maybe i wouldnt have had to witness one of the worst movies ever 
"A few weeks ago the German broadcaster ""SAT1"" advertised this movie as the ""TV-Event of the year"" - sorry, but I've seen better things on TV this year.<br /><br />I didn't thought much of the movie but I soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when I watched the commercial - namely Titanic and Pearl Harbor because the picture looked so familiar: The ""heroine"" (if I can really call her that) in the middle and her two ""loved-ones"" next to her - Pearl Harbor, anyone? In fact the love-story is a poor man's version of the one in Pearl Harbor and that one was already poor!<br /><br />But as I like watching movies and analyzing their patterns I eventually decided to watch that rubbish. The movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against Russia near the end of the Third Reich promising his wife that he will return. Now fast forward to Spring 1948: Germany lost the war and the allies & Russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies: capitalism versus communism. Well, I guess you already know the story because you have to know it - The movie doesn't really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts. The movie tries to depict the US government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially Great Britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they're trying to help.<br /><br />What was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroine's mother tells her daughter that Germany might be parted in two with a response like: ""That's impossible!"" Or when Stalin (where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he WILL look like him) says that Russia has to stop ""Coca Cola"" from spreading in Germany. Yeah right, if Stalin has ever said something like this. Or there is this one US pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it - please! Burgers were invented WAY before that time.<br /><br />In the movie you once see a map showing the airlines, funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer - in '48. The US general Lucius Clay who's main idea was to stay in Berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character Phillip Turner, the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects: Not enough African-American soldiers in the movie, there were like two in the whole film! Also relationships between US soldiers and German civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the US soldier would've been sent home. I don't want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married, If it wasn't for the death of the pilot in his fake CGI plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the CGI fire!<br /><br />If it wasn't enough all Americans in this movie spoke accent-free German although they only were in Germany for a couple of months - look I'm also American living in Germany for my whole life and even I have a little accent. Notably bad was also the child acting - the kids had like two expressions on their faces: ""Normal-I-look-monotonous-like-a-robot"" and grinning.<br /><br />All in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in Pearl Harbor just with half of the dialogue. The sad part is that the movie was very successful - 8.97 millions watched the first part and 7.83 millions the second part the day after thus SAT1 receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group.

"This was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It hit the exact spot of what Bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting. It showed how people with Bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life, friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is, is when Beth says,""It's not about you!"" That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It showed that people with Bulimia don't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else. It has to do with them and them only. It shows that it's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves. It showed that Beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom's attention at that time the most.",1,this was the best movie ive ever seen about bulimia  it hit the exact spot of what bulimia is really about and how its not always about being skinny and dieting  it showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life  friends and themselves  the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is  is when beth says  its not about you   that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem  it showed that people with bulimia dont have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else  it has to do with them and them only  it shows that its time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves  it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her moms attention at that time the most

"A drama at its very core, ""Anna"" displays that genuine truth that all actors age, and sometimes, fade away. Anna is a character that believes America is her safety net, her home, and it can do her no wrong  but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn't believe in. She is hard-nosed, optimistic, stubborn, and arrogant when it comes to her life, yet not afraid to let others in, yet drop them at a moments notice. Anna flip-flops between personalities, which makes this film ideal of an aging star, but not idea of the viewing audience. ""Anna"" has been praised for its star Sally Kirkland, and her ability to get ""grungy"" for the role, but a month into 2008, ""Anna"" does not remain a staple of film culture. It is dated, dull, and formulaically chaotic.<br /><br />Director Yurek Bogayevicz has a message hidden within ""Anna"" about the falsehoods of Czechoslovakia, both politically and socially, but Kirkland refuses to let them upstage her. Bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera, to use wooden frames to allow Kirkland to stand out, and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film, it is Kirkland you remember. If it isn't obvious, this film didn't sit well with me. From the opening of the first act and deep within the second, ""Anna"" felt like a high school theater production. The characters were non-existent, there was no enlightening pre-story, and there was no definition of time or place. There was Sally Kirkland, stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants. Randomly she encounters a friend, a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to America for the glitz and glamour, and two of them (within the span of 20 minutes) build a friendship that could break all walls. It is emotionally boring and unbelievable. Again, randomly, we meet Anna's boyfriend Daniel (played by the weak Robert Fields), who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character  only to boost the attention onto Kirkland's Anna. Through the course of nearly two hours, we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads  and SALLY KIRKLAND. Arg, it pains me to continue to say this but ""Anna"" could have been a fantastic film had Bogayevicz presented equal time between Anna, Daniel, and Krystina, but instead we are forced into a one-sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot.<br /><br />Is this where Charlize Theron found inspiration for her beauty-less role in ""Monster"", or Halle Berry in ""Monster's Ball""? Was Sally Kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character Oscar will shine in their direction? Throughout this film I was disgusted by Kirkland's portrayal of Anna, and Bogayevicz's lack of excitement for anything else fluent. Bogayevicz gives us an Anna that doesn't work hard for her parts, doesn't care for others, and is generally mean spirited  yet we are to feel sympathy for her? Near the beginning of the film, she forces what she wants to do onto others, and gets upset when she doesn't get her way. Sure, aging actresses my have that appeal to them, but Kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one. That is where ""Anna"" could have improved. If this was a mature Kirkland, I would have gobbled it up, but this stammering childish Anna was impossible to believe. While my favorite scene was near the end where Anna goes to watch one of her older films playing (included is absurd make-out characters) and the film burns, this scene is also one of my least favorite. Anna has made a phenomenal life for herself, creating films and building the dream, yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight, she gets jealous and outraged. This didn't make for a character I wanted to stand behind nor win Oscars. Coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer, the outrageous over-the top wardrobe, and the displaced ending (where did that come from and what happened??)  ""Anna"" slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema. It was a show-piece, an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time. In this one it worked, but I don't think I will be fooled again.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with this film. ""Anna"" is not a film about an aging film star; it is about Sally Kirkland, and ONLY Sally Kirkland. Bogayevicz tries to do more with the story, but fails either because Kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story. There are one or two decent scenes in this film, but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential. Bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe, tear up for, or dedicate a Sunday afternoon with  he created an annoyance. Kirkland wasn't Anna, she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides. Perhaps I missed the scope of this film, but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved. That wasn't the case here. In ""Anna"", Kirkland orders Daniel to act like a dog (apparently as a symbolic act) and yet during the entire emotional scene, I couldn't help but think that was what Kirkland was like to those on the set. She didn't make this into a film, she transformed it into her own production, and because of it ""Anna"" failed. I cannot suggest this to anyone  from one Czech to another  skip it! <br /><br />Grade: * ½ out of ***** (for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out)",0,a drama at its very core   anna

"If Todd Sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre, I would change my rating to an eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line, and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody. I could probably crap out alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have a better script. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's dad and the other dad walk, I repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies. This is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the ex-marine turns around, says ""God you're a horny bastard"", and shoots only one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds, while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm's length away. She then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Still, I enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny. Kudos to Todd Sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else.",0,if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre  i would change my rating to an eight  try to imagine a movie where every scene  line  and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody  i could probably crap out alphabet soup  rearrange what was left of the letters  and still have a better script  two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie  spoiler alert  one is when mikes dad and the other dad walk  i repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies  this is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead  nothing happens to them  when they reach the end  the ex marine turns around  says  god youre a horny bastard   and shoots only one  the other is in the military complex  the girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded  the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds  while she is surrounded by zombies at an arms length away  she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans  spoiler alert over  these scenes must be seen to be believed  still  i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because its so damn funny  kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else 
"The good fellas at Webster's Dictionary define Logophobia as the fear of words'. I may just be Logophobic. For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film, credits contain the words `Produced, Written and Directed by:', and are followed by a single individual's name. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few jack-of-all-trades. Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films. But there I was, all nestled in my theatre seat, popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball, were the words `Produced, Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland'. Whoa! <br /><br />Being a film buff, I knew of Brian Helgeland. As a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom company's stock price in 1998. There were as many theatrical unpleasantries (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory) as there were critical and award winning successes (L.A. Confidential, Mystic River). They seemed to alternate  one good, one bad, so knowing that his last film, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I took a breath and hoped for the best. In retrospect, I should not have exhaled. <br /><br />The Order stars Heath Ledger (Helgeland's A Knights Tale), as Alex Bernier, a priest in an order known as the Carolingians, who is summoned to Rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the Arch Bishop deems curious'. Meeting up with Father Thomas (also of the Order and played wonderfully by Still Standings' Mark Addy), they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priest's untimely death.<br /><br />Complicating matters is a sub plot involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience, they travel to Rome together.<br /><br />Nary a good nights sleep goes by and Alex is confronted by William Eden (Benno Fürmann) who claims to be a centuries old Sin Eater. A Sin Eater, as we are told, are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not, thus allowing entrance into Heaven. William, as luck would have it, is tired of a life of healing and looks for Alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties. Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex resorts to the ritual of the Sin Eater to save her and the transformation is complete. Alex then searches for answers to his many queries while Father Thomas unveils the Vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator. <br /><br />The Order is not a terrible film, but it is terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - that of Alex walking in on the dying Mara - is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couple's plight. Everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film.<br /><br />So, Mr. Helgeland, I plead with you not to try this again. Share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self-serving. Until then, there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade. Two stars.<br /><br />",0,the good fellas at websters dictionary define logophobia as the fear of words  i may just be logophobic  for no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film  credits contain the words  produced  written and directed by   and are followed by a single individuals name  think about it  there are carpenters  electricians and plumbers  but so few jack of all trades  even the most seasoned of directors like speilberg and scorsese rarely take such control of their films  but there i was  all nestled in my theatre seat  popcorn in hand and about to watch the order when hurled at me like a nolan ryan fastball  were the words  produced  written and directed by brian helgeland  whoa   being a film buff  i knew of brian helgeland  as a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom companys stock price in 1998  there were as many theatrical unpleasantries  assassins  the postman  conspiracy theory  as there were critical and award winning successes  l a  confidential  mystic river   they seemed to alternate  one good  one bad  so knowing that his last film  bloodwork was one of the most wasted efforts in clint eastwoods career  i took a breath and hoped for the best  in retrospect  i should not have exhaled   the order stars heath ledger  helgelands a knights tale   as alex bernier  a priest in an order known as the carolingians  who is summoned to rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the arch bishop deems curious  meeting up with father thomas  also of the order and played wonderfully by still standings mark addy   they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priests untimely death  complicating matters is a sub plot involving mara sinclair  played by shannyn sossamon  who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill alex during an exorcism  alex has feelings towards mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience  they travel to rome together  nary a good nights sleep goes by and alex is confronted by william eden  benno fürmann  who claims to be a centuries old sin eater  a sin eater  as we are told  are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not  thus allowing entrance into heaven  william  as luck would have it  is tired of a life of healing and looks for alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties  alex is reluctant  but after the death of his new love mara  alex resorts to the ritual of the sin eater to save her and the transformation is complete  alex then searches for answers to his many queries while father thomas unveils the vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator   the order is not a terrible film  but it is terribly boring  there were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters  even in the most dramatic scene   that of alex walking in on the dying mara   is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couples plight  everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film  so  mr  helgeland  i plead with you not to try this again  share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self serving  until then  there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade  two stars 
"In the fifties the age restrictions for films in Brazil were the following: no restriction, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. Usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old, when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14, but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18. Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average. The hero, James Stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from virtuous, she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited for a western. It was to be made into a Fritz Lang film, which did not come through. When it was offered to Mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of western, but still maintaining all its traditions. Winchester still is a great film to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released.",1,in the fifties the age restrictions for films in brazil were the following  no restriction  10 years old  14 years old and 18 years old  usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old  when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14  but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18  winchester 73 was one of those  and i think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average  the hero  james stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father  he was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized  far from the average good guy  anthony mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with stewart  shelley winters  the leading lady was far from virtuous  she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle  dan duryea as waco johnnie dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered  the story of the film  which always follows the man who stays with the rifle  is one of the best suited for a western  it was to be made into a fritz lang film  which did not come through  when it was offered to mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for lang  with winchester  mann created a different conception of western  but still maintaining all its traditions  winchester still is a great film to see again and again  but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released

But in all seriousness, it was good. First episode is obviously finding it's feet, but it's got that Silverman weirdness running all the way through it. It's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy, but that's good thing, too much has a laughter-track to it, and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh, it's to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all. I can easily see this as being the bizarro Drew Carey show with it's weird characters and incredibly strong central character. Well worth a watch, look forward to the following episodes.

"As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my ""to rent"" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want ""fair"" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last.

"Six GIs, about to be send home and discharged, get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hooded figures, two male dancers pretend to have a fight. Behind them, on an altar, a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake, finally biting one of the dancers on the neck. The imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights. (This is definitely a female imitation snake.) The cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and, most definitely, no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed. Naturally, the GIs take a flash photo, send the cult members into an angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the ""snake"" and run off with it into the Asian night.<br /><br />One of the guys, the most offensive and snarky, dies from a cobra bite on the neck, though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room.<br /><br />Back in New York, it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives, still maintaining their bond with one another. Their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley (David Janssen) to graduate research student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a nice blond girl friend. Kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer. But they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy.<br /><br />Then a dark, shifty-looking, mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) shows up and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group.<br /><br />Guess what happens. First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash. Then Kelly gets a visit from Domergue. Something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths. They also reckon that maybe she's turning into a cobra, which is the case. Dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point.<br /><br />By this time Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled, particularly Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him, too, although he must explain to her what ""love"" is. No matter. A final reckless attack by the cobra woman against Long's girl friend -- not one of the six original offenders -- and Thompson must throw the snake out the window. On the pavement below, the body changes to that of Domergue. The end.<br /><br />I think I'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises. I'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing. Who paid for Domergue's fare from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who's paying her utility bills in the hotel? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? How come she speaks American English so well? What the hell's going on? The writers and director have clearly seen some of Val Lewton's modest horror films and, though not much effort has gone into this production, they've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from Lewton. In Lewton's ""The Cat People"", for instance, the woman is transformed into a black leopard but, with one tiny exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it. Most of the transformations here use shadows too, but unlike Lewton's, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous.<br /><br />Lewton also made occasional use of what he called ""buses"". Lewton's first ""bus"" was a literal one. A potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps. Something or someone is following her. She freezes with fright under a street lamp. Something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her. She looks upward. There is a loud, wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end. It's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her. The producers used at least two ""buses"" in this film and they amount to nothing. A guy is walking distractedly across an intersection, for instance, and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him. There is no set up to the shot. It's jammed in with a shoe horn.<br /><br />I don't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy, ugly, venomous, and phallic. As a matter of fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful. Furthermore, they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals. You want a reptilian symbol for masculinity? Try a six-lined racerunner. It's a really fast lizard. When it sees something to eat, it rushes up and gobbles it down.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to see some fine, low-budget scary films, don't bother with this one.

"""Happy Go Lovely"" has only two things going for it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with second tier stars. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy. The predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is way over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.<br /><br />The choreography is boring, but Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a ""dancing stand in"" in several of her pictures"". But when she did dance, it was just entrancing.<br /><br />It's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine.<br /><br />4 out of 10",0, happy go lovely  has only two things going for it  and those two things are vera ellens legs  this is a british  excelsior films  version of an m g m musical complete with second tier stars  i would imagine that vera ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star  but  im sorry to say  ms  ellens chance did not pay off  opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune  this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy  the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin  and with the exception of david niven  cesar romero  who is way over the top in his role of a producer  and bobby howes  who is totally wasted in a nothing role  the rest of the cast is totally forgettable  the choreography is boring  but ms  ellen gives it her all  she was never as famous as most of the other musical stars and she shouldnt be since she couldnt sing and even had a  dancing stand in  in several of her pictures   but when she did dance  it was just entrancing  its too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine  4 out of 10
"My God, what an incredible movie it is! Reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's movie ""We were Soldiers"" when ""the Company is not lost, they're just cut off"" And the other scene in Pearl Harbour when the British officer says to Ben Affleck ""If all Americans are like you, then God help the nation that goes to war with America!<br /><br />Put all 3 movies together and you would have enough BULLSHIT to fertilise the entire Sahara Desert.<br /><br />The story of the cut-off Battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that American preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it.

"""Stargate SG-1"" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG-1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.<br /><br />Having seen this series sporadically for it's first few seasons when it first came out, I didn't know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. ""Stargate SG-1"" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premise.<br /><br />This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time restriction of film. The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.<br /><br />""Stargate SG-1"" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: <br /><br />- The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goaul'd threat. <br /><br />- From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth. After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of Goaul'd/replicator/ori conflicts<br /><br />- The 8th season is probably the most mixed one. It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. <br /><br />- The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O'Neil. They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and human/Jaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.<br /><br />Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.<br /><br />Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.<br /><br />In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to find that it ends. The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG-1.",1, stargate sg 1  follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg 1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole  having seen this series sporadically for its first few seasons when it first came out  i didnt know how good this series would really be  10 years after i had last seen an episode  my old impression was that the series was great  but my impression was far from the truth   stargate sg 1  is more than just a simple sci fi series  it is one of the most well made  interesting  long running  exciting sci fi ever produced  and why  because it runs on an amazing premise  this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television  as a medium  with a suitable premise  is able to provide something that doesnt work on the time restriction of film  the sense of familiarity created by a long running series  watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief  and its all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show   stargate sg 1  kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years  but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show     the first few seasons  perhaps up to the 4th 5th  focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations  keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goauld threat     from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goauld and preventing attacks on earth  after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg 1 in a place of goauld replicator ori conflicts   the 8th season is probably the most mixed one  it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned  but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments     the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack oneil  they are both good continuations  although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak  because they seem to be about little more than sg 1 and human jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori  basically  after season 7  exploration was pushed to the background  which in many ways was a shame  because of the potential and mystery each planet episode  presented  on the other hand  it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were  even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest  the feeling i have is that it could go on  the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer  a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome  but ultimately things are as they are  in the end  because of the fact that i enjoyed everything  its a little hard to find that it ends  the big picture  however  the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years  is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew  those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg 1

"""Back of Beyond"" takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. Afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. Even the ending, of which plays out like a trite campfire tale (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), is almost just as ridiculous.<br /><br />It may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing, but are in the mood, at least, for something a little different than the usual.",0, back of beyond  takes place at a dive diner gas station in the middle of the australian desert run by tom mcgregor  paul mercurio   a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive  we get what  at first  confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister  though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film  are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle  afterwards  he appears as a terribly quiet  and sometimes  moody character in the presence of the arrivals  we know one thing is for sure and that is mcgregors sort of spiritual sense  his foresight of danger and such  his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story  the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves whos car breaks down and who rely on tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way  of course  tom falls for one of the thieves  a young woman named charlie  and suddenly  it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other  but not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action  in fact  the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant  but really fails to do so  even the ending  of which plays out like a trite campfire tale  and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws   is almost just as ridiculous  it may be worth trying if you dont mind the terribly slow pacing  but are in the mood  at least  for something a little different than the usual

I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but I believe this misses the point. All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception. It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. Betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody. Pym upbringing is so close to my own that I find it chilling watching. Peter Egan is in his finest role and the late lamented Ray McAnally is unbelievably good. Even the smallest roles played by such as Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are spot on. This cast is a Theatre Impresario's Dream. The Story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason. All my sympathies lie with Magnus Pym and his sole (non sexual) love for Poppy (Rüdiger Weigang-as wonderful as always. His only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals. OUTSTANDING!

"It must be assumed that those who praised this film (""the greatest filmed opera ever,"" didn't I read somewhere?) either don't care for opera, don't care for Wagner, or don't care about anything except their desire to appear Cultured. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan-song, or as a movie, this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster, with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy, lugubrious realisation of the text.<br /><br />It's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera (or, for that matter, a play, especially one by Shakespeare) is ""about"" should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionably, but without the smallest justification from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is ""about"" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the latter stages, transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe, though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face (but not heard as the voice) of Amfortas, and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the playing of the Good Friday music -- in which, by the way, the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf, an expedient which baffles me. In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can't think why Syberberg couldn't splice in, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music...<br /><br />The sound is hard to endure, the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording, and Knappertsbusch, though his tempi are often very slow, had what Jordan altogether lacks, a sense of pulse, a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and, after half a century, the orchestral sound in that set, in modern pressings, is still superior to this film.",0,it must be assumed that those who praised this film   the greatest filmed opera ever   didnt i read somewhere   either dont care for opera  dont care for wagner  or dont care about anything except their desire to appear cultured  either as a representation of wagners swan song  or as a movie  this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster  with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy  lugubrious realisation of the text  its questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera  or  for that matter  a play  especially one by shakespeare  is  about  should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio  syberberg  very fashionably  but without the smallest justification from wagners text  decided that parsifal is  about  bisexual integration  so that the title character  in the latter stages  transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe  though one who continues to sing high tenor    few if any of the actors in the film are the singers  and we get a double dose of armin jordan  the conductor  who is seen as the face  but not heard as the voice  of amfortas  and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music    in which  by the way  the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill laid turf  an expedient which baffles me  in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts  but i cant think why syberberg couldnt splice in  for parsifal and gurnemanz  mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of music    the sound is hard to endure  the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual  someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording  and knappertsbusch  though his tempi are often very slow  had what jordan altogether lacks  a sense of pulse  a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music    and  after half a century  the orchestral sound in that set  in modern pressings  is still superior to this film 
"Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself baffled. How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in a few reviews; simply put it is a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending.<br /><br />While many characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them, the worst by far is Paltrow. I have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, nasal, slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect Emma could not have saved this film.",0,reading through all these positive reviews i find myself baffled  how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel  there are many problems with the film  already mentioned in a few reviews  simply put it is a hammed up  over acted  chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending  while many characters are mis cast and neither ewan mcgregor nor toni collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them  the worst by far is paltrow  i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles  but here she is abominable   she is self conscious  nasal  slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her  an extremely disappointing effort   though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film

"Very slow-paced, but intricately structured and ultimately very touching. A nice, very true-to-life look at a small Florida beach town in the dead of winter -- I've been there, and this is absolutely accurate.<br /><br />It's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe this film is 12 years old -- I remember seeing it in theaters, and I recently rented ""Ruby"" again. Except for the 80's looking clothes, it has held up very nicely. Ashely is so radiant and touching here, that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing. Boy, talk about failing to fulfill your early promise! Anyone seeing Ashley here in ""Ruby In Paradise"" would assume this elegant, natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting -- instead she has become the ""go to"" girl for dumb action films and slasher movies! Very disappointing, but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise.<br /><br />As some other commenter's say, this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced. This is not an action film, nor is it really a romance. The director (Victor Nunez, ""Ulees Gold"", another excellent character study) treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect, allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail. In that way, I think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming-of-age stories about young women that I can recall -- it's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or ""how she lost her virginity"", but about her life choices and her growing maturity.<br /><br />A lovely film, if you take the time to watch it...I think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls (or boys for that matter) and give them a chance to think about and discuss it.<br /><br />Particular kudos to director Nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and nicely detailed that I assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female-written novel or memoir, but in fact it's Mr. Nunez's original work.

"Holy crap this movie was bad. I watched it just as a joke. It isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way. This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry. It worked really well at doing that. It's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST, added in a bunch of ugly dudes, took out anything interesting, funny, or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction, and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese. That's all this is. Cheese. There isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to. There isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in. Why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy? Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is? Why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film, or even a B-movie. Now that I think of it, what they hell were they trying to do with this film? I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all!!! No, I'm not joking. That's what it's about. Does that sound good? This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion, with it's stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed, rude, and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible. A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks. The film, however, is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well. These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game. It's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film. The makers of this train-wreck had no strategy for set design, acting, camera angles, lighting, script, authenticity, or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting. There isn't even a single sex scene, or at least not a believable one. Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all, but his good looks were sadly put to waste. This is trash. In a perfect world, this film would get voted a 0.0. It's worth 0 as a film alone. A mentally handicapped nun who is blind, deaf, and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write, direct, and produce a better film, and she'd probably be a better actor as well. the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word ""film"" itself. This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format. I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x-mas tree and then record that and I've already made a film that will always be better than BEN & ARTHUR by at least half. There are only two things worse than death. Torture and watching BEN & ARTHUR. I'm a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me, and I don't think I've ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone. If this movie was a mistake, I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase ""It's okay to make mistakes"" to ""It's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN & ARTHUR."" You know how people always say things like, ""Good things come out of everything!""? I think that BEN & ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of. To call this movie the worst movie I've ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit. It's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own. There are good movies, there are bad movies, and then there's BEN & ARTHUR.

"I still wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces,overall.<br /><br />The ending was also very smart. I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone. It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.",1,i still wonder why i watched this movie  admittedly  before i viewed this film  i knew practicly nothing about the beatles  i didnt even know all their names  all i knew was that they had a ton of fans  they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever  they broke up  john married yoko ono  and john was murdered  also  vh1 isnt even my favorite music station  mtv is  still  for some reason or another i decided to watch it  not expecting much  surprisingly  i enjoyed it very much  the dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up  this is very important  because john and paul talking is pretty much the whole film  allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities  and to keep you watching  jared harris and adien quinn give good performaces overall  the ending was also very smart  i enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the snl performace  and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go  and end it on a good note  my favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene  overall  i recommend this film to almost everyone  it is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up paul just showed up on johns doorstep  which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film  settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup 
"I've barely just made it through one episode (""Crouch End""). The dialog was stilted and down-right cringe worthy. The acting was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expressionless. His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random, meandering plot. Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget. But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability. I get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare it's overall quality to something else, I'd put this episode of ""Nightmares and Dreamscapes"" on par with the NBC's Hercules.",0,ive barely just made it through one episode   crouch end    the dialog was stilted and down right cringe worthy  the acting was tragic  eion bailey  despite his best attempts to be dramatic  remains mostly expressionless  his eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment  claire forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie  the characters were cartoons  each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random  meandering plot  cheesy special effects can be excused given the tv miniseries budget  but attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability  i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising  but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story  if i had to compare its overall quality to something else  id put this episode of  nightmares and dreamscapes  on par with the nbcs hercules 
"Falls into the film category of ""Way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously"". Whereas Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth or My Boyfriend's Back know they are bad, Scarecrows doesn't. Evil Dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre, that Scarecrows is simply out of place. <br /><br />Suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane.

"Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He's known throughout the world as a globetrotting TV reporter. Less well-known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full-time philanderer.<br /><br />I saw `Vivre pour Vivre' dubbed in English with the title 'Live for Life.' Some life! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life: one mistress on her way out, one on her way in, and the cheated wife at home. It helps that Robert is a glib liar. Among his most useful lies are `I'll call you tomorrow' and `My work took longer than planned.' He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons. You wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down.<br /><br />Some may find his life exciting, but I thought it to be tedious. His companions, including his wife, Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful, you wonder if he's enjoying all this.<br /><br />Adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesn't further the plot. There are extended sections with no dialogue or French-only dialogue. We see documentaries of wars, torture, and troop training interspersed with the live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal.<br /><br />Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this film. Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can't find fault with Yves Montand's performance of what was basically an amoral bum.<br /><br />I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch's novel techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera pans around the room as Robert and his mistress argue. We catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room. In another scene set on a sleeping car of a train, Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower. Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news, but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train. I sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of those scenes and of those in Amsterdam was superb.<br /><br />I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I've named the project FIFTY: 50 Notable Films Forgotten Within 50 Years. As best I can determine, this film, like the other forty-nine I've identified, has not been on video, telecast, or distributed in the U.S. since its original release.

"This film is terrible. Every line is stolen from 8MM (the Italian dubbed version, at least). If you like trash... real trash, give it a try; but beware: this ain't the ""so bad it's good"" kind of flick. In its cheapness, it may really look like a porno but, believe me, if you're looking for ""snuff"", s & m, hardcore, softcore... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in store! I'm telling you this, 'cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, plot, dialogues (the only good lines, as I said before, are the ones they stolen from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the ""happy ending"" is absolutely revolting! I'll give it one star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after ""the eyes of the victim"" monologue (stolen from 8MM as well) and a half for mom & daughter's sexy bodies (that didn't manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)",0,this film is terrible  every line is stolen from 8mm  the italian dubbed version  at least   if you like trash    real trash  give it a try  but beware  this aint the  so bad its good  kind of flick  in its cheapness  it may really look like a porno but  believe me  if youre looking for  snuff   s   m  hardcore  softcore    or even an ordinary erotic thriller  go find something else in store  im telling you this  cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting  acting  plot  dialogues  the only good lines  as i said before  are the ones they stolen from joel schumachers 8mm   will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the  happy ending  is absolutely revolting  ill give it one star  a half for the sudden shot in the back scene  after  the eyes of the victim  monologue  stolen from 8mm as well  and a half for mom   daughters sexy bodies  that didnt manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey  anyway  
"This is your standard musical comedy from the '30's, with a big plus that it features some well known '30's actors in small fun cameo's.<br /><br />There is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and 'no-worries' overall kind of atmosphere, with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it. Appereantly it's a 'Cinderella story' but I most certainly didn't thought of it that way while watching the movie. The story gets very muddled in into the storytelling, that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance, when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios.<br /><br />Of course the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free. Also Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as the director of the short.<br /><br />It's certainly true that all of the cameo's and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem, since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character.<br /><br />The movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period, though the rating on here would suggest otherwise.<br /><br />7/10",1,this is your standard musical comedy from the 30s  with a big plus that it features some well known 30s actors in small fun cameos  there is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and no worries overall kind of atmosphere  with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it  appereantly its a cinderella story but i most certainly didnt thought of it that way while watching the movie  the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling  that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance  when the main characters hit the hollywood studios  of course the highlight of the movie is when laurel   hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines  its like watching a movie and getting a laurel   hardy short with it for free  also laurel   hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson  without a mustache this time  as the director of the short  its certainly true that all of the cameos and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem  since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character  the movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period  though the rating on here would suggest otherwise  7 10
"I wondered why I didn't like Peggy Sue Got Married more than I did, when it first came out in 1986, with all the hype. Somehow I found Nic Cage's character off-putting. Way off-putting. Then the plot didn't seem to make sense. Then by the end of the credits, the question came to mind: What point was this movie making? What was it saying? The answer, unfortunately, was not much, if anything. I really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was ""your life is your life, you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole"". Not a very profound statement, and I'm sorry, not profoundly made in this movie. The writing simply isn't that good. The direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times. Kathleen Turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make. <br /><br />She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I didn't enjoy this movie more. She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola's direction every step of the way, doing it ""his own way"" (not a good idea for a new actor), and putting on a goofy voice she called ""stupid"". His voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. I understand what he was attempting to do: play a young-guy ""hot shot"" who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure. But he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of ""fighting the Man"", we would have had a more enjoyable film. Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others. But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety, I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put-on) scenes. <br /><br />The movie doesn't aim for a statement, doesn't make a point, is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression (but without the voice), and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time. Given all this, Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. I can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. Believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense. <br /><br />Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments, which proves that she's strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other people's comments. You go, Turner! I'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first-rate actor or actress, but her candor is refreshing. Cage's acting can be good to annoying, and here it doesn't work. At least, in this film, now we know why.",0,i wondered why i didnt like peggy sue got married more than i did  when it first came out in 1986  with all the hype  somehow i found nic cages character off putting  way off putting  then the plot didnt seem to make sense  then by the end of the credits  the question came to mind  what point was this movie making  what was it saying  the answer  unfortunately  was not much  if anything  i really dont think this movie aimed at making a statement  unless it was  your life is your life  youre gonna make the same mistakes no matter what  so keep your eye upon the doughnut  and not the hole   not a very profound statement  and im sorry  not profoundly made in this movie  the writing simply isnt that good  the direction is uneven  and is strangely overblown at times  kathleen turner was the best  and in my opinion  only worthwhile thing in this movie  and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre  unexplained circumstances  with a script that had no apparent statement to make   she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didnt enjoy this movie more  she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppolas direction every step of the way  doing it  his own way   not a good idea for a new actor   and putting on a goofy voice she called  stupid   his voice was annoying  abrasive and unnatural  and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy  i understand what he was attempting to do  play a young guy  hot shot  who is not as hot as he thinks he is  setting up his own karma for future failure  but he goes overboard  the way he does it is abrasive  not effective  and if he had listened to his uncle instead of  fighting the man   we would have had a more enjoyable film  cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person  and those scenes are more watchable than others  but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety  i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l a  to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected  put on  scenes   the movie doesnt aim for a statement  doesnt make a point  is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression  but without the voice   and is  ultimately  confusing and a waste of time  given all this  kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie  i cant recommend anyone spending two hours watching this  unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes  believe me  you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes  and it will make just as much sense   kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments  which proves that shes strong enough to be honest  and to hell with other peoples comments  you go  turner  im not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first rate actor or actress  but her candor is refreshing  cages acting can be good to annoying  and here it doesnt work  at least  in this film  now we know why 
"Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. Don't expect the production values of a theatrical release, but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release.<br /><br />It is set up as Timon & Pumba begin watching the original Lion King in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story. This is done with frequent comedic interruptions. For example, during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined Pumba realizes he has sat on the remote. These little moments pepper the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor. If you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie, than this may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Animation is the best they've invested in the Disney DTV line, and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material. The newer, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original. The voice talents are all well performed, though I couldn't help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner.<br /><br />Many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations, but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive.<br /><br />The music has made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a Disney feature. The toe-tapping opening feature of 'Dig A Tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious. Timon and Pumba's take on the Lion King's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing. The only problem was the reprise of the 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the movie, switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting.<br /><br />Story line is pretty well done, and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly, though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little. The new story doesn't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well, and does better when it is resorting to full comedy. <br /><br />Overall, worth purchasing. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, then go for it. For the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick, wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away. <br /><br />Damion Crowley.",1,lion king 1 1 2 is a very fun and addictive sequel  dont expect the production values of a theatrical release  but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release  it is set up as timon   pumba begin watching the original lion king in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story  this is done with frequent comedic interruptions  for example  during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote  these little moments pepper the movie  and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor  if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie  than this may not be your cup of tea  animation is the best theyve invested in the disney dtv line  and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material  the newer  independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original  the voice talents are all well performed  though i couldnt help thinking of marge simpson every time i heard julie kavner  many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations  but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive  the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature  the toe tapping opening feature of dig a tunnel is well choreographed and hilarious  timon and pumbas take on the lion kings opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing  the only problem was the reprise of the dig a tunnel at the end of the movie  switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting  story line is pretty well done  and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly  though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little  the new story doesnt seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well  and does better when it is resorting to full comedy   overall  worth purchasing  if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2 disc set  then go for it  for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick  wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away   damion crowley 
"Run away from this movie. Even by B-movie standards this movie is dreadful. It is also insidious in it's theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie, see it instead.<br /><br />No normal kid would do what Trent does. State Troopers do not work as they do in this film etc. Seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche. Mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker,who yes, has had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her.<br /><br />Usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for, in this case there is none. It is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters. The acting is adequate by B-movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting.",0,run away from this movie  even by b movie standards this movie is dreadful  it is also insidious in its theme  the main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring  people who treat others with respect are losers  guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie  see it instead  no normal kid would do what trent does  state troopers do not work as they do in this film etc  seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker with a heart of gold cliche  mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker who yes  has had a terrible life  however  she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her  usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for  in this case there is none  it is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters  the acting is adequate by b movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting

"This is an absolutely charming film, one of my favourite romantic comedies. It's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful. Though Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre. He manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor, who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways, to the lovesick puppy that falls for Lady X played by Merle Oberon effortlessly. The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting. Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well. I highly recommend it.",1,this is an absolutely charming film  one of my favourite romantic comedies  its extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful  though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre  he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor  who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways  to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly  the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting  ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well  i highly recommend it 
"""Red Rock West"" was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script (by John and Rick Dahl) that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured a marvellous cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance) making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed. The film never had much publicity on release (in fact I first caught up with it on TV) and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock. Mistaken for a contract killer named Lyle from Dallas he is shocked to be offered $10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double dealings - that Cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of! Then just to complicate matters even further the real Lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing (played by everyone's favourite heavy Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what has happened he goes after Cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow.<br /><br />Some favourite lines from the film:<br /><br />Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): ""I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money"".<br /><br />J. T. Walsh (to Cage): ""Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this"".<br /><br />Boyle (to Cage): ""You're not a killer?"". Cage: ""That's right, no. But the guy I'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here"".<br /><br />Boyle (to Cage): ""O.K. How you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $10,000 from my husband?"".<br /><br />An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (just 98 minutes) with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals. Any film featuring J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and ""Red Rock West"" was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period for ""film noir"" was without any doubt the forties but ""Red Rock West"" is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my ""Top Ten"" list of all time favourite films. I look forward to more like this from director John Dahl. 10/10.

"FULL OF SPOILERS.<br /><br />This is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) that plot the murder of one's rich wife (Cannon) to get the property and the insurance. The plot succeeds but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder -- with only slight changes in the details. Reeve allows that Easthampton, Long Island, can become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for instance. The rest of the play's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth Reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon's apparently accidental death. It will boost the revenues and his own Warhol quotient.<br /><br />Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play, perhaps with Reeve's input, that would redeem his reputation. He cannot permit Reeve's scandalous play-a-clef to be produced. So -- what else? -- he tries to murder him. In the end they wind up killing one another, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she makes a million bucks selling it to Broadway.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One is the production design. That multi-roomed, multi-storied house with the big windmill atop, situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) would be a splendid set of digs anywhere. You wouldn't be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is not overly large or baroque in its decor. It's just magnificently modest, although it's a little tidy for my tastes, the kind of house that's so clean you're afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot.<br /><br />Next, the acting could hardly be improved upon. Caine, Cannon, and Fred Jones are superb. Dyan Cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they'd been sprayed on, which is okay given her assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer. Irene Worth, as the psychic neighbor Helga, was in some way hard to define, a mistake. Granted she -- or someone like her -- was necessary to the plot, but, my God, what an offensive snoop her character is, going around and claiming, ""I feel pain in zis woom!"" I suppose in order to make her a little more interesting, she's got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it. Still, she's a nuisance from beginning to end.<br /><br />You have to love Ira Levin's bitchy dialog. The distraught Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all play. ""Because it's THERE, Sidney!"" says Reeve, and Caine shouts, ""That's MOUNTAINS, not PLAYS! Plays aren't there until some ***hole WRITES them!"" Great too is Caine's call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright, as planned.

When he hangs up, his face assumes its usual placid expression, he blows his nose into his handkerchief, and walks away, all business again.<br /><br />The climax, though suitably ironic, is confusing and noisy and full of artifice, lacking in the wicked charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes.

"This movie is completely ridiculous. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrendous. The special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. Yet, it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic. I highly recommend this movie, just because of its utter idiocy. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!",1,this movie is completely ridiculous  not only is the plot atrocious  but the acting is horrendous  the special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post apocalyptic desert  yet  it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced  it is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000  or any el caminos  there are also other aspects which i will not spoil  just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic  i highly recommend this movie  just because of its utter idiocy  i have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature  but if a good laugh is what you need  watch exterminators of the year 3000 
"i like Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm half way through Mansfield Park. But i couldn't stand Emma. I gave up on the book after 2 chapters, and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about Emma. She didn't seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows acting (which as excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest for the movie. Dunno. <br /><br />The costumes are nice, but the dancing was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly is bloody gorgeous, and although it as a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor, i liked his singing.",0,i like jane austin novels  i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies  and im half way through mansfield park  but i couldnt stand emma  i gave up on the book after 2 chapters  and by the end of the movie i couldnt care less about emma  she didnt seem to change at all  maybe it was paltrows acting  which as excellent in se7en  or my lack of interest for the movie  dunno   the costumes are nice  but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin firth and jennifer ehle  i gave it a 2 basically for the fact knightly is bloody gorgeous  and although it as a rather patchy performance for ewan mcgregor  i liked his singing 
"A gave it a ""2"" instead of a ""1"" (awful) because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork. But that wasn't enough to save it.<br /><br />The ""sepia"" toned, washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies. Nothing new there. I can see there were some hat-tips to other old, classic movies. OK. No problem with that.<br /><br />But a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting, not something that would put you to sleep.<br /><br />The story line and the script of this movie WAS awful, the characters two dimensional.

"Watching CBS's ""Surrender, Dorothy"", I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it's a television movie--with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses, it isn't any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV--but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine). A single mother, grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes upon--and gradually becomes friends with--the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid. Aside from being coarse and dim, these phony people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside (one young man, who wears muscle shirts to tell us he's gay, hears Diane Keaton say, ""Surrender, Dorothy"" and actually asks, ""That's from ""The Wizard of Oz"", right?""...no, genius, it's from ""Citizen Kane""!). Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death. She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage (lots of kooky outfits), but it doesn't sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way. Here, she's a crazed harpy who doesn't learn many lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the movie quickly forgets it's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom, who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat, ""It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there"". I can't imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer, muddled and baffling.

"I'm always surprised about how many times you'll see something about World War 2 on the German national television. You would think they don't like to open old wounds, but there isn't a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war. Perhaps it's a way of dealing with their past, I don't know, but you sure can't blame them of ignoring what happened. And it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies (think for instance about ""Der Untergang"" or ""The Downfall"" as you might now it) which are also very realistic.<br /><br />One of those movies is ""Rosenstrasse"". It tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war, even though the movie starts with a family in the USA, at the present day. After Hannah's father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn't been very religious before. She doesn't know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from, but as she starts digging in her mother's troubled childhood, Hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother's past.<br /><br />The fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising. For as far as I know, there hasn't been another movie that deals with this subject. (For those who didn't know this yet: Being married to a so-called pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they weren't immediately sent to one of the concentration camps, but that they had to work in a factory). But it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages, it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives. How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything within their power to free their men, once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrasse...<br /><br />The acting is really good and the story is very well written, although the way it was presented in the beginning didn't really do it for me (and that's exactly the only part that you'll get to see in the trailer). Perhaps it's just me, but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day. At least of the part that is situated in the USA, because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother's past, definitely works.<br /><br />If you are interested in everything that has something to do with the Second World War, and if you aren't necessarily looking for a lot of action shots, than this is definitely a movie you should see. This isn't a movie in which you'll see any battles or gunfights, but it certainly is an interesting movie, because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of. I give it an 8/10.",1,im always surprised about how many times youll see something about world war 2 on the german national television  you would think they dont like to open old wounds  but there isnt a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war  perhaps its a way of dealing with their past  i dont know  but you sure cant blame them of ignoring what happened  and it has to be said  most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies  think for instance about  der untergang  or  the downfall  as you might now it  which are also very realistic  one of those movies is  rosenstrasse   it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war  even though the movie starts with a family in the usa  at the present day  after hannahs father died  her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasnt been very religious before  she doesnt know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from  but as she starts digging in her mothers troubled childhood  hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mothers past  the fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising  for as far as i know  there hasnt been another movie that deals with this subject   for those who didnt know this yet  being married to a so called pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they werent immediately sent to one of the concentration camps  but that they had to work in a factory   but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages  it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives  how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people  most of the time women  did everything within their power to free their men  once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrasse    the acting is really good and the story is very well written  although the way it was presented in the beginning didnt really do it for me  and thats exactly the only part that youll get to see in the trailer   perhaps its just me  but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day  at least of the part that is situated in the usa  because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mothers past  definitely works  if you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war  and if you arent necessarily looking for a lot of action shots  than this is definitely a movie you should see  this isnt a movie in which youll see any battles or gunfights  but it certainly is an interesting movie  because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of  i give it an 8 10

"This is one of those horror flicks where twenty-somethings fool around with the dark arts around a camp fire, getting into a heap of trouble for doing so. A portal was opened containing a world of demons known as the Kelippoth of the Sitra Achra by a man whose daughter, Summer, gets kidnapped by something, taken into it. Summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters. This is a portion of the plot which lends itself to scrutiny. Anyway, three wannabee witches, who went to high school together, Renea, the most enthusiastic, serious practitioner in the dark arts, and her lesbian cohorts, Jasmine and Marlene(..it's more or less a passing fad with them, though..) join up with buddies, Jason and Ricky, on a trip in the wilderness where Summer vanished from her home ten years ago. Opening the portal through a spoken text written in an ancient book, a demon is set free, as is Summer, now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world.<br /><br />Low budget contains a loopy, but ambitious story, restraining it into a confined setting. These young adults spend a lot of time running around in the woods hoping not to be fodder for a beast. As can be the case in these movies, the demon stands on the sidelines while the story develops as Summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass, while befriending Jason who wishes to help her restore the lost time. The action is shot mostly in the dark, making any violence hard to decipher. Brigitte Kingsley(and the rest of the female cast for that matter), is some mighty nice eye candy, dressed scantily clad as a female Conan, a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie. Some lesbianism(..some kissing and fondling)and nudity spice things up nicely, and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot..it's so preposterous that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material.<br /><br />Might be of interest for co-starring World Wrestling Entertainment's ""Captain Courageous"" Christian(real name, Jason Reso)as one of the group, spoofing his alter ego, as a chicken, quivering at the sound of a snapping tree twig. Landy Cannon is likable as unlikely hero, Jason, a lovestruck, naive young man whose ex-fiancé, Jasmine(Vanessa James)is now bi-sexual and in love with Marlene(..Jasmine's cruelty is in toying with Jason's feelings by hiding her affair with Marlene from his knowledge), while Ricky and Renea attempt to steer him away from this idea that he can rekindle a dead flame that gone out, never to ignite again. The Kelippoth demon is mostly darkly lit, I guess to refrain from showing how ludicrous/laughable it looks if presented in full. The lesbian antics of Jasmine and Marlene(Haley Shannon) is mostly tame, their love making, once alone in the woods up against a tree, is toned down and also lighted using the blackness of night. My rating is a bit favorable towards it, almost solely because of Kingsley, for purely superficial reasons, rather than the plot or film-making. The movie aims to please and is marketed to the boys(and girls who love hot women).

"It could have been a better film. It does drag at points, and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix's death, but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil. His stories are all morality tales, due to his own considerations of Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world view), and the human condition.<br /><br />Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist, who has sided with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He has been sent to England to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed. Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain. In particular Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez) a grim boarding house keeper, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras) a teacher of an ""esperanto"" type international language. Wanda Hendrix is the drudge of a girl (Else) who works for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a willing associate of the Falangists.<br /><br />The Brits (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander, and best - if not worst - of the lot, George Coulouris) don't give much hope to Boyer's cause (which he soon grasps may be Britain's before long). Herbert and Mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald's and Stanley Baldwin's governments during the Civil War. Coulouris here is a typical Col. Blimp type - always impeccable in his native English diction, he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general.<br /><br />The one ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she can't really. She's an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord. It was Bacall's second film, and (sad to say) almost sank her long career. She does act well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is a fine actor, but he's not Bogie, and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks. Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again, and her star resumed it's ascendancy.<br /><br />It's a bleak film (as was the novel). Boyer's mission never succeeds, as he has too many hidden foes all over the place. But the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives.<br /><br />With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her).

"Priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That is what this man is known for, or rather, was known for. After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't recollect for now. Now with hideous films like Dhol, the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture'.<br /><br />Dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. <br /><br />Speaking of the acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.<br /><br />The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. And at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine.

"I thought this was an utterly charming film. The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong does well in the lead, but the best performances are by his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and, of all people, Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are way off base on this one. They seem to be taking Pecker's worst valuation of his work as gospel, when I think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist.",1,i thought this was an utterly charming film  the story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of john waters  peckers greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places  edward furlong does well in the lead  but the best performances are by his grandmother  mink stole  a hilarious cameo  and  of all people  patty hearst  i think the reviewers are way off base on this one  they seem to be taking peckers worst valuation of his work as gospel  when i think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist 
"In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as a career, family, friendship, and love. In this way, we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small necessities. If you act in an inverse way, you will not have enough room for larger stones. The five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large ""stones"" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish motion picture director defines his first feature Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, conflicting trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954-).All are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or, worst, that are in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) who also stars in ""20 Centimeters,"" ""Busco,"" ""Crimen Ferpecto,"" ""Entre Vivir y Sonar,"" ""Hongos,"" and ""Octavia.""

"The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. The different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times.<br /><br />It may sound weak and cliché but it's true; You're way better of watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. I'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure. For a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin just aren't good actors, not even when they play themselves! Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.<br /><br />The movie had quite some potential, I mean Steve Irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was; brilliant! The movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. The movie does has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still, I must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie.<br /><br />Watching this movie felt like a waste of time. Still this movie might be watchable just once, when it gets on TV, on a rainy afternoon. It does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.<br /><br />4/10",0,the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters  the different story lines dont feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times  it may sound weak and cliché but its true  youre way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin  its more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is  im sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesnt give us the viewers much pleasure  for a comedy it simply isnt funny enough and steve and terri irwin just arent good actors  not even when they play themselves  their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scenes feel long  distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times  the movie had quite some potential  i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch  so when i first heard that they were making a movie about the crocodile hunter my first reaction was  brilliant  the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters  the movie does has a certain entertainment value  at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still  i must certainly wouldnt recommend this movie  watching this movie felt like a waste of time  still this movie might be watchable just once  when it gets on tv  on a rainy afternoon  it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential  4 10
"Ooverall, the movie was fairly good, a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes, but Chuck Norris did hardly anything, except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. The movie was very similar to the events of Sept. 11, with a bin laden-like terrorist sending a video to the president (Urich) and threatening to detonate it. Judson Mills had some superb action roles, taking out Rashid's compound and various kick-butt roles but, there was a lack of Chuck Norris. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on her computer. But, overall, it was realistic and didn't lack the action, but only did it on Mr. Norris' part. I gave the film 7/10.",1,ooverall  the movie was fairly good  a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes  but chuck norris did hardly anything  except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters  the movie was very similar to the events of sept  11  with a bin laden like terrorist sending a video to the president  urich  and threatening to detonate it  judson mills had some superb action roles  taking out rashids compound and various kick butt roles but  there was a lack of chuck norris  judson took over most of the action  leaving joshua  chuck  with que on her computer  but  overall  it was realistic and didnt lack the action  but only did it on mr  norris part  i gave the film 7 10 
"Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours, the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional, thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding. There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their 'love' is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel;you are given no impression of Jane's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him.<br /><br />Despite to poor scripting, I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, however overall the production was poor. Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See ""Jane Eyre"" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.",0,having read the novel before seeing this film  i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot  i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of brontes work  and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story  in the condensing of the film to a short 2hours  the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional  thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding  there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre  so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their love is superficial  this is such an injustice to brontes novel you are given no impression of janes quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her  and his arrogance which attracts jane to him  despite to poor scripting  i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely  namely mrs fairfax and grace poole  however overall the production was poor  given a better scripting  perhaps the film would have been more successful  see  jane eyre   1970  with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production

If you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get.

A few other faces you most likely won't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you won't remember them or care about them after the movie is done.<br /><br />Supposedly based on a book called ""The Terrible Game,"" which, if I could find a single trace of it's existence anywhere I would be interested in reading it, to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book apparently is a figment of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse made up in order to sell his lame idea.<br /><br />Pick this one up and Yakmallah it for yourself.

"The Good Earth is not a great film by any means, it is way to ordinary. Maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer. It is not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long. I could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act. In short Wang Lung (Muni) a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him. Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds. The film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next. Also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments, it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis.",0,the good earth is not a great film by any means  it is way to ordinary  maybe it was different in the 1930s but who would want to see the life of a farmer  it is not very interesting to me  yes  luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long  i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act  in short wang lung  muni  a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him  both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds  the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next  also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments  it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis

"I haven't seen anything this bad since I walked out of the James Bond movie ""Moonraker"" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this beast.<br /><br />As a cross between ""Pi"", ""Orlando"", and ""Tron"", this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking. The characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy. The plot was wholly unbelievable. The acting was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. The computer graphics were worse than in ""Tron."" Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what's the point.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it.

"Kim Novak's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover, and James Stewart's her choice. Scintillating comedy of manners, from the Broadway stage; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and performed by a sterling cast.

"This is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips/commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie. On one hand the imagery, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly ""expensive"" look and feel. Even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot.<br /><br />In this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all.<br /><br />So 50% of the dialog consists of ""What the hell was that ?"", ""What was that ?"" and ""What the hell was that ?"". In none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though. In most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them.<br /><br />The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with. That way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to. I mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this:<br /><br />Ben: Is this real, huh ? Emily: Stop it. Ben: A mass psychosis, huh ? Jon: Somebody has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can't be controlled. Not by you, not by anybody. Emily: Not by you either. Ben: No<br /><br />Got me goosebumps. But not for horror, more for the horrible attempt. In some moments I felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita.<br /><br />2 stars for the excellent technical work.",0,this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie  on one hand the imagery  camera  lighting  cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly  expensive  look and feel  even the actors show a certain amount of potential   unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot  in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all  so 50  of the dialog consists of  what the hell was that      what was that    and  what the hell was that     in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though  in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasnt ever explained to them  the only reason why skye bennets performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didnt allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with  that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldnt even get close to  i mean theres not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this  ben  is this real  huh   emily  stop it  ben  a mass psychosis  huh   jon  somebody has to take control of this situation  ben  this situation cant be controlled  not by you  not by anybody  emily  not by you either  ben  no got me goosebumps  but not for horror  more for the horrible attempt  in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita  2 stars for the excellent technical work

"Never even knew this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy of it, hidden deep in my dusty horror closet. The title on the box said ""Insect"" and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie. They can surely be fun, of course, as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make-up effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in ""Blue Monkey""! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense. Following the always-popular trend of ""big-bug"" movies, ""Blue Monkey"" handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. The makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! All we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. Other than this, there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! Like I said, don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. The first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) but the second half (when the entire hospital is put to quarantine) is dreadfully boring. It is also near the end that ""Blue Monkey"" begins to exaggeratedly rip-off older (and better) films. Approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore. ""Blue Monkey"" is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made.

"I am not a very good writer, so I'll keep this short. World at War is the best WWII documentary that I've seen. I've seen different WWII documentaries (not only English/North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary that I've seen. I think it could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why/how Hitler got to power, but it does a very good job at covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective/fair to everyone.

"Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving, it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic. Mai's graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps. Tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character. You can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing ""The King and I"". Aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right.<br /><br />This film is truly a keeper.",1,everyone in the cast  from sugiyama to aoki and toyoko is someone we know in everyday life  they were so natural  and sugiyamas transformation is incredibly believable  the score is so moving  it brought me to tears  the choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic  mais graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps  tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character  you can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing  the king and i   aokis character is both hilarious and pitiful  masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife  you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right  this film is truly a keeper 
"Kalifornia is disturbing. I believe there is no reason for this story to be told. It is neither entertaining nor does it have social value. Technically, the movie is very well make, the performances are top rate and first class. The story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest. But at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency. I recommend Kalifornia to no one.",0,kalifornia is disturbing  i believe there is no reason for this story to be told  it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value  technically  the movie is very well make  the performances are top rate and first class  the story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest  but at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency  i recommend kalifornia to no one

Darkman ranks up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get the point. There isn't too many good horror, thriller, sets out there. Many thanks to the whole crew, and set for giving us the Darkman trilogy. By the way if your wondering how I came across this one on DVD. I purchased it through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most US DVD players are region 1.

"A meteor crashes into Crater Lake, the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch.<br /><br />Alright, so the plot is just trash. But despite its obvious low budget, this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-on-the-loose films in existence. There are also some good moments of humor. In an age filled so-called 'monsters' which are no more than laughable men-in-rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces (cheap exploitation-style), it's refreshing to discover that the Plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent Harryhausen-style stop-motion creature.<br /><br />Quite a hard film to find, but it's worth finding.",1,a meteor crashes into crater lake  the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch  alright  so the plot is just trash  but despite its obvious low budget  this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster on the loose films in existence  there are also some good moments of humor  in an age filled so called monsters which are no more than laughable men in rubber suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces  cheap exploitation style   its refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen style stop motion creature  quite a hard film to find  but its worth finding 
"Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon do the gambling world proud. The various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself.<br /><br />There are a few surprises. AS cynical as we are today, I fully expected the 'good girl' to be crying over his grave, instead of his Buddy's. Especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend', when she first meets Matt. And then of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (interesting role by Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG!!! some of the other Hollywood endings DO happen, but the writing is so excellent, the acting so carefully wrought that you're blissfully unaware.<br /><br />And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first being unleashed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a little racism raring its ugly head in Chicago, but at a club called, wonderfully, 'Biloxi' with a Confederate flag backing up the racist remarks. I'll be watching it again, just to hear the music. Good thing I have the FACTOTUM sound track, so I can listen to that in the car. Watch both together, and you'll see how Matt has matured....playing bar room characters in both. NOw that he owns a bar in the Paramount HOtel in NYC, he probably has great opportunity to do his studies. Great actor, just coming into his own. He shows finely nuanced performances ...the good and the bad in his characters. His 'young boy off the farm' is a great study, made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes. He makes love, convincingly as well. Since he was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teen-ager, I wonder how that it ...making love to an actress you kinda grew up with.

"""In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. One year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. It took him 45 years to go back."" Supposedly, ""Keep the River On your Right"" is ""a modern cannibal tale"". In reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed.

"This movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, great music, and excellent visuals without significant special effects. It is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. That's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: ""1984"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey (compare its space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimov's ""I Robot"" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's).",1,this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast  a gripping story with a chilling ending  great music  and excellent visuals without significant special effects  it is interesting to note though that  like so much science fiction  its predictions for the future dont appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted  thats not to say were out of the woods yet  but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition  it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics   1984    2001  a space odyssey  compare its space station with our international space station  and isaac asimovs  i robot   positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990s  
"This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation, while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York. He manages, however, to leave behind some clues, scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspects her at once, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon's secretary and would-be blackmailer. Hartley is, I believe, the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner anyway.<br /><br />The murder is well handled. It's a good plot, and none of the performers or crew fluff anything. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, only a skosh over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked it. There are moments when she almost teeters, but she consistently exudes charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when she's being serious or when she's putting Columbo and the audience on. She's given some good lines too. What humor there is comes from Gordon. Columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments.<br /><br />All in all, a nice job by everyone concerned.",1,this is the one in which the diminutive ruth gordon plays an agatha christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe  gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation  while gordon is traveling back and forth to new york  he manages  however  to leave behind some clues  scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well hidden note  columbo enters the case  suspects her at once  and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers  oh  and mariette hartley is on hand as gordons secretary and would be blackmailer  hartley is  i believe  the grand daughter of the psychologist b  f  skinner  im not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button  which is on display during a belly dance sequence  but ive always admired skinner anyway  the murder is well handled  its a good plot  and none of the performers or crew fluff anything  but the outstanding figure here is ruth gordon  only a skosh over five feet tall  she was over 80 years old and looked it  there are moments when she almost teeters  but she consistently exudes charm  her acting is idiosyncratic  you can never be sure when shes being serious or when shes putting columbo and the audience on  shes given some good lines too  what humor there is comes from gordon  columbo doesnt have any of his frequent comic moments  all in all  a nice job by everyone concerned 
"Drawing Restraint 9. dir: Matthew Barney.<br /><br />How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art film? Is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment. Or, when you're about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal, and still annoying, version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies. At 135 minutes, it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot. I would call the use of color stunning, and the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. That is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but that will be coming up later.<br /><br />Actually, the documentary-esquire portions were the best parts of it. The surface plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual about making whale fat. Then, there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passed-out head shaving (think frat boy pranks), nicotine patches, and giant furry pita hats. Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and lets not forget the giant turd.<br /><br />Matthew Barney has written that this is about ""the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity."" That's almost like saying, ""if you don't get it, then you're not creative in your interpretation, so sod off because I'm an artist."" Oh, wait, that's the POST-modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was POST-modern. But, its supposed to be Modern art. Which is about the art itself.<br /><br />So, let's start this whole interpretation bit, shall we? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie.<br /><br />The first half-hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp. Obviously, the ramp is symbolic of the need for self-elevation to whatever standards you hold dear, and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then, on a whaling ship, they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale. Obviously a crude element of foreshadowing.<br /><br />On the ship, they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale, and take out the fins portion. They replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd. These are supposed to be the states of the movie itself. When its fat, its entertaining but bad for you. When it is the spinal column, its the ""important"" parts of the movie, or the backbone so to speak. Then, the giant turd is the bowels of the movie, or when the movie is crap.<br /><br />Bjork and Matthew Barney the arrive on separate ships, are put into strange humiliating outfits which AREN'T EVEN WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL, one suspects that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking. SO, they put patches on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese wise man, who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it; a crash or intersection, if you will. This inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, to start cutting each other's legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person. They intersect. Oh, did I forget to mention that this has been done in a Robbie Williams video? Then, the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid Venn Diagram. Barney made it through 8th grade geometry, obviously. Or, maybe at least some social studies.<br /><br />Oh, and did I forget Bjork's ear-gouging I-want-to-kill-her score? At times it is hypnotic, but at others you just want to assassinate her.<br /><br />Art film is one thing, but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people, it becomes a self-destructive joke. When do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and/or entertaining than this piece of trash. Un Chien Andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour.<br /><br />So, can I recommend this? Only if you like dull HIGH ART films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery.<br /><br />D+",0,drawing restraint 9  dir  matthew barney  how do you know when youre in the middle of a pretentious art film  is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film  is it when bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudo asian ritual  maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment  or  when youre about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal  and still annoying  version of a philip glass score  in any case  drawing restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies  at 135 minutes  it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot  i would call the use of color stunning  and the opening sequence interesting  but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a discovery channel documentary  that is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of p ss christ  but that will be coming up later  actually  the documentary esquire portions were the best parts of it  the surface plot is about a whaling ship  and then there is a ritual about making whale fat  then  there are the guests in the form of bjork and matthew barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passed out head shaving  think frat boy pranks   nicotine patches  and giant furry pita hats  then there is mutual evisceration  cannibalism  and lets not forget the giant turd  matthew barney has written that this is about  the relationship between self imposed resistance and creativity   thats almost like saying   if you dont get it  then youre not creative in your interpretation  so sod off because im an artist   oh  wait  thats the post modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was post modern  but  its supposed to be modern art  which is about the art itself  so  lets start this whole interpretation bit  shall we  the following lines are only 3 4 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie  the first half hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp  obviously  the ramp is symbolic of the need for self elevation to whatever standards you hold dear  and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom  then  on a whaling ship  they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale  obviously a crude element of foreshadowing  on the ship  they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale  and take out the fins portion  they replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd  these are supposed to be the states of the movie itself  when its fat  its entertaining but bad for you  when it is the spinal column  its the  important  parts of the movie  or the backbone so to speak  then  the giant turd is the bowels of the movie  or when the movie is crap  bjork and matthew barney the arrive on separate ships  are put into strange humiliating outfits which arent even well made or symmetrical  one suspects that they ran out of money and barney was trying to quit smoking  so  they put patches on his head  they go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a japanese wise man  who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it  a crash or intersection  if you will  this inspires bjork and barney  who are different on the outside  to start cutting each others legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person  they intersect  oh  did i forget to mention that this has been done in a robbie williams video  then  the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid venn diagram  barney made it through 8th grade geometry  obviously  or  maybe at least some social studies  oh  and did i forget bjorks ear gouging i want to kill her score  at times it is hypnotic  but at others you just want to assassinate her  art film is one thing  but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people  it becomes a self destructive joke  when do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art  dali and bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and or entertaining than this piece of trash  un chien andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour  so  can i recommend this  only if you like dull high art films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery  d 
"This early Sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, is a minor film, yet showcases the flair of the German director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art. Set in the 1910's, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her small-town husband and family for the lure of the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions, and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre (a high school production, that is). Back in her old town she once again comes up against small-mindedness, and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, bewildered (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and ex-lover. The plot is nothing new but Sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions, with every frame carefully shot, and he is aided immeasurably by having Stanwyck as his leading lady. It runs a crisp 76 minutes, and that's just as well, because the material doesn't really have the legs to go any further.",1,this early sirk melodrama  shot in black and white  is a minor film  yet showcases the flair of the german director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art  set in the 1910s  barbara stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her small town husband and family for the lure of the chicago stage  she never fulfilled her ambitions  and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre  a high school production  that is   back in her old town she once again comes up against small mindedness  and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter  bewildered  and boring  husband  richard carlson  and ex lover  the plot is nothing new but sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions  with every frame carefully shot  and he is aided immeasurably by having stanwyck as his leading lady  it runs a crisp 76 minutes  and thats just as well  because the material doesnt really have the legs to go any further 
"Had I been familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before seeing the movie, I might not be as fond of it as I am. Although in all fairness, I would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite the actor as well, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.)<br /><br />As for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and though Isabel Bingley's voice outshines that of Jean Simmons, it is not more pleasant. I find it to have a rather shrill quality. Jean Simmons' voice is much more realistic, though admittedly, that is not always a huge concern in musicals. Also the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of ""Luck Be A Lady"" and only there because I was previously familiar with Sinatra's version. I also find Vivian Blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on Broadway. And Sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others, if they indeed were in need of redemption. (They weren't) It is infinitely better than Sam Levene's, particularly in my favorite song, 'Sue Me'. <br /><br />Also, the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs, I beg to differ. 'A Bushel and a Peck' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it, 'Pet Me Poppa"" and its accompanying performance is more Hot Box material. I personally do not care for 'Marry the Man Today' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie. I adore 'I've Never Been In Love Before', and though it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. The song 'A Woman In Love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach. And the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included on Broadway. In fact, if the movie soundtrack were available for sale, I'd recommend purchasing it instead of the Broadway. <br /><br />Though I have not seen the original production, I cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors. <br /><br />The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so.",1,had i been familiar with the stage production of guys and dolls before seeing the movie  i might not be as fond of it as i am  although in all fairness  i would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both brando  for his acting  and sinatra  for his voice  although he is quite the actor as well  see the manchurian candidate or from here to eternity   as for some of the other reviewers statements about the songs  i have the broadway soundtrack and though isabel bingleys voice outshines that of jean simmons  it is not more pleasant  i find it to have a rather shrill quality  jean simmons voice is much more realistic  though admittedly  that is not always a huge concern in musicals  also the only time i particularly noticed marlon brandos particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of  luck be a lady  and only there because i was previously familiar with sinatras version  i also find vivian blaines voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on broadway  and sinatras voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others  if they indeed were in need of redemption   they werent  it is infinitely better than sam levenes  particularly in my favorite song  sue me   also  the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs  i beg to differ  a bushel and a peck is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it  pet me poppa  and its accompanying performance is more hot box material  i personally do not care for marry the man today at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie  i adore ive never been in love before  and though it was not sung in the movie  the instrumental version can be heard when nathan is in adelaides dressing room  the song a woman in loveexpresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach  and the movie wouldnt be the same without the song adelaide  not included on broadway  in fact  if the movie soundtrack were available for sale  id recommend purchasing it instead of the broadway   though i have not seen the original production  i cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movies lead actors   the important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so 
"This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. As a man married for 26 years, I empathize with Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that. I also enjoy his monotone delivery; never gets too excited or too low. A nice ensemble of characters. This will be a nice addition to the Monday night line-up.<br /><br />I don't know how David Spade will be in his role. He is best enjoyed in small doses. He also seems a little old to still be trolling for women.<br /><br />I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to seeing how the series develops.",1,this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship  as a man married for 26 years  i empathize with patrick warburtons character  he loves his wife  but he assumes she knows that  i also enjoy his monotone delivery  never gets too excited or too low  a nice ensemble of characters  this will be a nice addition to the monday night line up  i dont know how david spade will be in his role  he is best enjoyed in small doses  he also seems a little old to still be trolling for women  i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops 
"Or released on DVD or screened on a cable channel like Amer. Life TV network. I have been watching another favorite, ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", as well as ""Lost in Space"" and Land of Giants"". They've been showing them forever but aren't receptive to suggestions for other shows. My father and I were big fans as I was already a big science/electronics nut, (still am) and my father was an old school chum of Nader. They both attended Oxy together. I still have memories of several of the episodes even though I was only 9. More so than any show that old. I think it was televised on Sat. after ""Bonanza"". Some of the episodes I recall are the one where he takes the experimental drug that slows down action. Or the one where he body surfs the big ones, (I did that too!)

"Yes, even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice, this show is pretty bad. I didn't mind the first couple of shows, but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place.The antics of Alex and Aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show.<br /><br />Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on television, and she definitely wasn't the smartest girl around (very media savvy, but I doubt there's much more there).<br /><br />I haven't really watched any of the shows since, apart from the occastional re-run on daytime TV. I think the point of reality TV is to treat it as ""entertaining trash"". View it as something you can laugh over, and don't have to think too hard about ( I don't watch CSI its like reality TV-tired and clichéd, but you have to think too much anyway while watching).<br /><br />A couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show. At the very first 'the woman tell all"" Woman such as Amy ( who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her. Hey Amy, how about joining a club? getting a hobby? doing charity work? changing your job to one where you meet more guys? gees, all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.<br /><br />Amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting ""the perfect man'. Clue to ladies: he doesn't exist. There are, however, many great guys out there that would make great husbands, some who may be right for you! they may not earn six figures a year or be a JFK junior look alike, but they are great guys all the same. The shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable. Im still a youngster, at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner. This show is proving otherwise.<br /><br />Overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society. It really is a terrible show and I think all of these types of shows should just stop being made. The best dating shows by a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun. Nothing is manned more between the ""couples"" than a simple night out. the bachelor, sadly takes itself way too seriously.",0,yes  even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice  this show is pretty bad  i didnt mind the first couple of shows  but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place the antics of alex and aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show  ryan  you can have trista  she had the most annoying voice ive ever heard on television  and she definitely wasnt the smartest girl around  very media savvy  but i doubt theres much more there   i havent really watched any of the shows since  apart from the occastional re run on daytime tv  i think the point of reality tv is to treat it as  entertaining trash   view it as something you can laugh over  and dont have to think too hard about   i dont watch csi its like reality tv tired and clichéd  but you have to think too much anyway while watching   a couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show  at the very first the woman tell all  woman such as amy   who had a lot of class about her  commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasnt happening for her  hey amy  how about joining a club  getting a hobby  doing charity work  changing your job to one where you meet more guys  gees  all i know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner  amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting  the perfect man  clue to ladies  he doesnt exist  there are  however  many great guys out there that would make great husbands  some who may be right for you  they may not earn six figures a year or be a jfk junior look alike  but they are great guys all the same  the shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable  im still a youngster  at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner  this show is proving otherwise  overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society  it really is a terrible show and i think all of these types of shows should just stop being made  the best dating shows by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel because they are fun  nothing is manned more between the  couples  than a simple night out  the bachelor  sadly takes itself way too seriously 
"An entertaining kung fu film, with acting, plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky. All of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy antics are fun to watch, and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills. For me, the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast -- at times, things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots, and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed-out as one might wish.<br /><br />But a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple definitely delivers on that count. The film climaxes with a high-bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent.<br /><br />Overall, Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li film, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10.<br /><br />Misc notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video release I saw was (predictably) poorly dubbed, and lacked full cast & crew credits.",1,an entertaining kung fu film  with acting  plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky  all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists  alexander fu shengs proto jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch  and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills  for me  the films only glaring flaw is the size of the cast    at times  things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots  and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might wish  but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action  and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count  the film climaxes with a high bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent  overall  shaolin temple is an enjoyable low budget kung fu movie  not up to the quality of a good jet li film  but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre  my rating  8 10  misc notes  the 1987 warner home video release i saw was  predictably  poorly dubbed  and lacked full cast   crew credits

"Schlocky '70s horror films...ya gotta love 'em. In contrast to today's boring slasher flicks, these K-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.<br /><br />This is a B movie about the making of a B movie...that went horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) stars as an over-the-hill, B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home. Her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule. The Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add ""realism"". Unfortunately, ""realism"" is something they could have done without.<br /><br />John Carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate. He goes about his daily work, but always seems to run afoul of the director.<br /><br />The horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (At least there's truth in advertising.) It's just sad that the ghoul didn't understand that there was a movie being made above him. How was poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chants would actually work?

"This is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron. The acting is second rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film. And god help Gina Gershon. Her accent is too over the top. It sounds nothing like an true English woman. It sounds forced and phony, much like her acting. She should stick to what she does best, lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are no better. They are two dimensional. empty, vapid and silly. How are we to supposed to care about these people. At one point Christy Scott Cashman get's lost in Central Park. Really? It's not that hard to navigate Central Park. Just follow any path out. Not only did I not care about ANY of the characters,I downright hated them. The only reason I even stayed with this train-wreck of a film was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying Fish.

"I love this movie!!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and it has had my heart since I can remember. Prince is so tight in this movie. I went to a special showing of Purple Rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued, it is really one of the greatest movies of all time. The music is untouchable. The movie is about ""The Kid"", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in town, and he has his eyes on the Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no question why purple is my favorite color I can thank ""The Kid"" for that. So if you have not seen this then you are need to asap.

"Protégé runs in a linear fashion; expect no fast-paced action, and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating-on-the-edge moments.<br /><br />There is not much of a crux, so don't expect one either. I would not fault the acting - the show would have been much worst if not for Wu's acting which was the film's only saving grace. And, oh that cute little girl too.<br /><br />The humour is at best, weak, and the show must as well pass off as an anti-drug campaign which employs the usual shock-tactic (esp in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us stuff that we already know - i.e. drugs break up families, heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to wean off, you will fall into a vicious cycle.<br /><br />I know it may seem all a little harsh, but I feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy (*SPOILER ALERT*: Take for example when Andy Lau got brought to the police station: what? we were just told 'oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997', and THAT is how he got caught. Nope, no chasing-car action, just a jump-of-scene, which kind of undermined Wu's role as an undercover in the first place.)

"This is an amateur movie shot on video, not an ""electrifying drama"" as the DVD liner notes falsely boast. I have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with a proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English, e.g., ""Where you go now?"" To say the production quality is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared away yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.",0,this is an amateur movie shot on video  not an  electrifying drama  as the dvd liner notes falsely boast  i have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students  the bulk of the story unfolds with an all nite taxi ride around jakarta  this movie could have been made using a single video camera  but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later  the editing is extremely rough  the final edit was probably done with two cameras  bouncing content back and forth  instead of with a proper editor  perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too  the english subtitles were written by someone not fluent in english  e g    where you go now   to say the production quality is on a par with blair witch is generous  if youre not scared away yet  this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor  with lots of cool and funky images from all over jakarta 
"What a fun filled, sexy movie! They certainly don't make them like this anymore. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and have all sorts of sexual misadventures. The tone is oddly innocent, as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations, rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters. It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant. Richard O' Sullivan literally gets 'Randi'(sic). The film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school. My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I am a huge fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress has ever looked better naked (she's slim but wonderfully curvy), or clothed, come to that (I've loved her since the original run of UFO - who else could carry off a purple wig!), I'll eat my hat.",1,what a fun filled  sexy movie  they certainly dont make them like this anymore  4 sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures  the tone is oddly innocent  as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations  rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters  it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant  richard o sullivan literally gets randi sic   the film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school  my special interest in au pair girls is that i am a huge fan of gabrielle drake  if any actress has ever looked better naked  shes slim but wonderfully curvy   or clothed  come to that  ive loved her since the original run of ufo   who else could carry off a purple wig    ill eat my hat 
"Despite the excellent cast, this is an unremarkable film, especially from the aviation perspective. It may be somewhat better than the egregious ""von Richthofen and Brown"" but not by much.

"What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized! This is the first filmed version of 'Hamlet' to use the full text of Shakespeare's play, but Branagh didn't do it just because ""it was there."" His intention, I believe, was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down, so to speak. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves, a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain.<br /><br />The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well, it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding, which helps immensely when you're watching a four-hour movie. Branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of 'Hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work.<br /><br />Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors, if not always the best, since he made his big splash with 'Henry V.' One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work. Let's face it, 'Hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before, he or she needs help even if they've read the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film, even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word. This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />There are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention, but some of them must be acknowledged. Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise. Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling, made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time! She looks to me like the finest young actress around. Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney, and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, respectively. Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie, Charlton Heston, and Robin Williams, who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The one cast member who doesn't, inexplicably, is Jack Lemmon. In the very opening scene he appears, and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood, Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor. You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh, since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a perfectionist.<br /><br />Not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie, but it does seem just a tad too long. Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit, if I may be so bold, and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.<br /><br />Did I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle's score? No doubt I did. I'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'Hamlet,' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.",1,what an ambitious project kenneth branagh undertook here and how well it was realized  this is the first filmed version of hamlet to use the full text of shakespeares play  but branagh didnt do it just because  it was there   his intention  i believe  was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down  so to speak  in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves  a fair enough proposition and one thats a bargain  the setting is a generic 19th century european one and this does more than work well  it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself  the production design and cinematography and both outstanding  which helps immensely when youre watching a four hour movie  branaghs casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise  the direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play  since so much of hamlet is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels  battles  etc   this can be a daunting task  but everything branagh tries to do seems to work  branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor writer directors  if not always the best  since he made his big splash with henry v  one quibble i had with him was what i saw as a tendency to ham it up at times  in his portrayal of hamlet here he might be accused of that again  but there is a method at work  lets face it  hamlet is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before  he or she needs help even if theyve read the play  hamlet has the most lines of any shakespearian character and branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film  even if you dont know the literal meaning of every arcane word  this performance by branagh was at the very least worthy of an oscar nomination  there are so many other outstanding performances here theyre almost too numerous to mention  but some of them must be acknowledged  derek jacobi as claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to kate winslet when it comes to handing out praise  her portrayal of ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling  made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time  she looks to me like the finest young actress around  other super performers in no particular order are richard briers  nicholas farrell  michael maloney  and reece dinsdale and timothy spall as guildenstern and rosencrantz  respectively  honorable mention goes to julie christie  charlton heston  and robin williams  who manages to do his thing here successfully  even billy crystal as a gravedigger works  the one cast member who doesnt  inexplicably  is jack lemmon  in the very opening scene he appears  and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood  lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor  you know this must have been a real dilemma for branagh  since everything else about the movies screams out that its the work of a perfectionist  not to be facetious when speaking of a four hour movie  but it does seem just a tad too long  some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit  if i may be so bold  and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome  did i forget anything  other than patrick doyles score  no doubt i did  ill just sum up by saying that kenneth branagh may have made the definitive film version of hamlet  and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one 
"Given the title, this first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff, here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as Noel Langley (though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected, much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled “The Colonel’s Lady”). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time), it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain.<br /><br />“The Verger” tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because he’s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! <br /><br />The second episode, “Mr. Know-All”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick), British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate)!; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford’s position if he were to tell, so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! <br /><br />As can also be deduced from the title, “Sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous (the ‘feud’ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie), one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naïve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ‘lifer’ while Rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar).",1,given the title  this first follow up to quartet  1948  obviously reduces the number of w  somerset maugham stories which comprise the film  the author still turns up to introduce the episodes  but there’s no epilogue this time around  by the way  while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r c  sheriff  here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation  as well as noel langley  though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison   as can be expected  much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members  namely naunton wayne  wilfrid hyde white and felix aylmer  the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled “the colonel’s lady”   while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor  slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running time   it’s still done with the utmost care  acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain  “the verger” tells of a church sexton  james hayter  – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest  michael hordern  simply because he’s illiterate  rather than rest on his laurels  despite his age  he not only takes a wife  his landlady  played by kathleen harrison  but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and  with business flourishing  this is developed into a whole chain  the last scene  then  sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who  not only is surprised to learn of hayter’s lack of education  but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy  and respected  tobacconist replies  with some measure of irony  that he had the calling to be a verger   the second episode  “mr  know all”  is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging  a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man  nigel patrick   british despite his foreign sounding name of kelada  who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun  naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife  anne crawford   during a fancy dress party  however  the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on kelada by having one of them impersonate him  a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate    still  it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation  wayne challenges patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford’s position if he were to tell  so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer   as can also be deduced from the title  “sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by andre morell  the protagonist is a new intern  roland culver  who wistfully observes the various goings on  the narrative  in fact  highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous  the ‘feud’ between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium  played by finlay currie and john laurie   one melodramatic  the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies  and one bittersweet  the romance between naïve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which  in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a ‘lifer’ while rennie only has a few years left to him  leads the couple to the altar  
"This story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last Harem of the Ottoman empire, well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone, and learn about the people who lived there.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story, characters, acting and scenes. A few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece.<br /><br />The main character Safiya is played wonderfully by Marie Gillain who I am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and lovely.<br /><br />I recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating.",1,this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire  well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone  and learn about the people who lived there  i enjoyed the story  characters  acting and scenes  a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly  otherwise a wonderful piece  the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it  the scenes with her and alex descas  nadir  are charming and lovely  i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating 
"The 1930s. Classy, elegant Adele (marvelously played with dignified resolve by Debbie Reynolds) and batty, frumpy Helen (the magnificent Shelley Winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache) are the mothers of two killers.

The super cast have a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist, Yvette Vickers as a snippy, overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star, Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective, and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum. An elaborate talent recital set piece with Pamelyn Ferdin (the voice of Lucy in the ""Peanuts"" TV cartoon specials) serving as emcee and original ""Friday the 13th"" victim Robbi Morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on Mae West impression qualifies as a definite highlight.

"I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. The singing just kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT.<br /><br />Furthermore, I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in.<br /><br />Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.",0,i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a while   what with all its raving reviews  nominations and media attention  and i must say  the first quarter of the movie was good  it really portrayed the black music scene back then  however  as the movie wore on  me and my whole family were bored out of our wits  the singing just kept coming  one after the other  i mean seriously  just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent  furthermore  i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters  i just didnt care what happened to them  even when eddie murphys character died of a drug overdose  i knew i should have been sad  but i just couldnt feel any emotion for that character  the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot  but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in  finally  the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care  which goes along with the lack of character development  this movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on ray  chicago  and rent  ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion   overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story  yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances

"Watching John Cassavetes film, Opening Night, I was reminded of something that Quentin Tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting. He referred to an example of, say, if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldn't be the end of his life but that it would affect him, and that, without a doubt, he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy. ""Otherwise,"" as he said, ""what am I doing?"" I couldn't help but think of his words when watching Gena Rowland's character, Myrtle Gordon, who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario. There is more to this in Cassavetes' film, of course, since it's about how the theater works around a star actress, what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character, and how one lives when all one has (like Myrtle Gordon) is the theater.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the film, after exiting a performance, Myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named Nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to Myrtle. It's a touching little moment, but it doesn't last as she has to get in the car (pouring rain and all). She then watches in horror as the girl, who stood right next to the car as it drove off, gets hit by another car in an auto accident. She's not sure really what happened, but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit. From then on she's sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it's out of her system. At first this shows in small ways, like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor (played by Cassavetes) and can't seem to stand being hit - she blames it on the lack of depth in the character (the writer: ""What do you think the play lacks?"" ""Hope,"" says Myrtle)- but then Nancy starts to show up to her, an apparition that to Myrtle is all to real, until she's suddenly gone.<br /><br />Cassavetes, as in the past films, is after a search for what it means to have emotion, to really feel about something and feel it, or the lack thereof, and how it affects others around the person. This isn't exactly new ground for Rowlands, who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in Woman Under the Influence (in that case because of alcohol), nor would it be alien territory for costar Ben Gazzara, who just came off starring in Killing of a Chinese Bookie. But the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene; Cassavetes doesn't tell them how to get from A to B in a scene, and he doesn't need to. There's a mood in a Cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work. You know Myrtle, for example, should be content somehow, even if it isn't with the plot. But she's haunted, and is unsatisfied with her character's lack of depth and the tone of the play (""Aging, who goes to see that?"" she asks the playwright), and it starts to affect those around her too.<br /><br />The question soon becomes though not what is the usual. A conventional dramatist would make the conflict 'Will she be able to go on stage, will the show go on?' This isn't important for Cassavetes, even if it's there, as is the question 'Will she be alright?' Perhaps going through such a grueling play as ""The Second Woman"" could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality (seeing Sara and attacking her in front of total strangers, who wonder what the hell is going on)? Or will the play's lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her? The depths Rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing, and that it's expected doesn't mean it's any duller than Woman Under the Influence- if anything, it's just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession, and consequently the other performances are just as true, from Gazarra to Nancy played by a subtle Laura Johnson. Cassavetes answers to his own posed questions aren't easy.<br /><br />One of the real thrills of Opening Night, along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script, is to see Cassavetes take on the theater the way he does. We see the play performed- and it's apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what it's about. When we see the actors on the stage performing it, we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on (relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence) and the improvisation of the actors. I wondered watching how much really was improvised, how much Cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where Myrtle starts to go loopy or, in the climax, is completely smashed. He's on the stage, too, so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen.<br /><br />It's funny, startling, chilling, and edge-of-your-seat stuff, some of the best theater-on-film scenes ever put in a movie, and we see the lines between actor on stage, actor on film, actor with actor, blur together wonderfully. Opening Night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness, reality and fiction, where the love is between people, and really, finally, what does 'acting' mean?",1,watching

"I only recently found out that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD. The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several times.<br /><br />Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well cast, with a likable (if too pretty) Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /><br />The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene. Unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead) and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. Mrs Whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here. I could go on and on, nearly every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.<br /><br />This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films. What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it's sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.",0,i only recently found out that madeleine lengles novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd  the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times  despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel  the murry family is well cast  with a likable  if too pretty  meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating   the first half hour is promising enough  doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene  unfortunately as soon as the non human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart  alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit  think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead  and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive  she must have visited faye dunaways plastic surgeon in recent years  for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west  in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction  i understand that this is a tv movie  but the cgi looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier  mrs whatsits centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast  who in the novel is a velvety  elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here  i could go on and on  nearly every artistic choice is a disaster  presumably because there wasnt a large enough budget to do this justice  but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement  this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films  what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting childrens literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and its sequels for the big screen  giving it the scope it deserves 
"This is easily one of the worst martial arts films I've ever seen, and that's saying something. The chant of viva Chiba, viva Chiba is heard at the title, soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid, stupid. The basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into Japan and one man vowels to stop them, of course that's our man Sonny Chiba. The Karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords. A woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard, but what are her true intentions? Let me say at this point who cares? Soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment. Sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills, end of story. Oh yeah the woman was corrupt too. Congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever.<br /><br />As stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films I have ever seen. What makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be. Some have already mentioned the infamous American intro put into the film. That's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it's beyond funny. I would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70's karate scene was at the time. Watch as Aaron Banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student (bad editing) punching him in the throat. But everything is badly done in this film. Terrible unbelievable fights, fake I mean fake blood, bad acting, dubbing, wardrobe, and let's not forget the story. One man to take out an entire drug problem in a country? I bet. Fight after fight is laughable. This was the 70's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight, but Chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie. Let's see he kicks a gun in half, kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene, give me a break. Not to mention the fact that it's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it's filmed so poorly. One part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture. OK. As the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood, really fake blood. Too say it looked poorly made is and understatement. The acting is totally non existent in this film. I don't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good, but it wasn't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor. Was it my imagination or did they dub the Asian go go dancer with a black accent? As expected from a 70's wardrobe you'll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks. Also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time? Don't try and hide it now. The characters were stupid as well. The pimp club owner's one of whom is decked out in a Japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie. Also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling. It was very annoying.<br /><br />Overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making. That doesn't mean that it's not entertaining. With a film made so poorly it's hard not to laugh through most of this film, if you can stomach it. This was an old favorite watch with my best friend. If it was purely bad I would give one star, but the laughs it delivers bumps it up. 4 out 10.",0,this is easily one of the worst martial arts films ive ever seen  and thats saying something  the chant of viva chiba  viva chiba is heard at the title  soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid  stupid  the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man vowels to stop them  of course thats our man sonny chiba  the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords  a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard  but what are her true intentions  let me say at this point who cares  soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment  sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills  end of story  oh yeah the woman was corrupt too  congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever  as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen  what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be  some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film  thats probably the most entertaining part of the film and its beyond funny  i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70s karate scene was at the time  watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student  bad editing  punching him in the throat  but everything is badly done in this film  terrible unbelievable fights  fake i mean fake blood  bad acting  dubbing  wardrobe  and lets not forget the story  one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country  i bet  fight after fight is laughable  this was the 70s when people still believed karate was effective in a fight  but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie  lets see he kicks a gun in half  kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene  give me a break  not to mention the fact that its very hard to tell what happens in the fights because its filmed so poorly  one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture  ok  as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood  really fake blood  too say it looked poorly made is and understatement  the acting is totally non existent in this film  i dont expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good  but it wasnt and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor  was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent  as expected from a 70s wardrobe youll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks  also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time  dont try and hide it now  the characters were stupid as well  the pimp club owners one of whom is decked out in a japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie  also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling  it was very annoying  overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making  that doesnt mean that its not entertaining  with a film made so poorly its hard not to laugh through most of this film  if you can stomach it  this was an old favorite watch with my best friend  if it was purely bad i would give one star  but the laughs it delivers bumps it up  4 out 10 
"Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film of Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion piece to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in the 2005 CAPOTE. They really play well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well. These two truly enhance each other. Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces blend well. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name then Capote. I'd suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It makes for a powerful experience!",1,richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman capotes novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffmans oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote  they really play well together  try them on separate nights   it is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well  these two truly enhance each other  even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock  the two pieces blend well  only the part of the writer  played by paul stewart  in the brooks films is weaker  as they give him a different name then capote  id suggest watching capote first  followed by in cold blood  it makes for a powerful experience 
This was another great Tom Berenger movie.. But some people are right it was like another SGT BARNES character but it was still awsome.. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungles Of Panama! Billy Zane was a wuss at first just like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end! Sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it.. I remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick.. i got this one on DVD too and it is excellent!,1,this was another great tom berenger movie   but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome   tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama  billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end  sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it   i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick   i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent 
"This is a low budget Roger Corman horror/creature flick. A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. An engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. None of the characters have any depth, but then they are not the focal point. We only get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best ""kill"" scenes in a small budget film.<br /><br />My favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. Nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. With no real stand out roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed with the alluring Joanna Pacula as the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming as a crock of pickles.",0,this is a low budget roger corman horror creature flick  a dinocroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok  an engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping  none of the characters have any depth  but then they are not the focal point  we only get a few glimpses of the huge two legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best  kill  scenes in a small budget film  my favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself  nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet  with no real stand out roles  jane longendecker  bruce weitz and charles napier  most pathetic is matt borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter costas mandylor  i was most impressed with the alluring joanna pacula as the respectfully feared dr  p  dinocroc is redeeming as a crock of pickles 
"I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all.<br /><br />I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comments. <br /><br />Quoting: ""From the ""Dune"" inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected.""<br /><br />The Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving, well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. I mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $100,000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. As far as ""repeat viewing is not unexpected"" I think he made a typo.<br /><br />Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: ""The acting is also a strong aspect of the film.""<br /><br />With all due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton.<br /><br />The catchy Tagline: ""Beware the hour between dusk and darkness""<br /><br />That's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie.<br /><br />MPAA rating ""Rated R for some violence/gore""<br /><br />The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. As far as I know it might be a clump of grass.<br /><br />In summation, I have seen horror flicks from the 50's, 60's and 70's. I have seen what I thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempt, was asleep, or took a hit of acid. Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. I would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'B' movie.",0,i rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen  i read the comment from gumby 8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew  unless gumby 8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all  i couldnt believe gumby 8s comments   quoting   from the  dune  inspired opening animation to the quick pace   this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected   the animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving  well thats because you keep looking for any type of suspense  i mean give me a break halloween was shot with a budget of  100 000 00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic  as far as  repeat viewing is not unexpected  i think he made a typo  another quote from gumby 8 the only fan   the acting is also a strong aspect of the film   with all due respect for the actors  their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of robert napton  the catchy tagline   beware the hour between dusk and darkness  thats because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie  mpaa rating  rated r for some violence gore  the only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see  as far as i know it might be a clump of grass  in summation  i have seen horror flicks from the 50s  60s and 70s  i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good  the director of this film either did not make any attempt  was asleep  or took a hit of acid  whatever the case i think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction  i would give this film a rating of  5 for a b movie 
"Well I'll start with the good points. The movie was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad it was funny. Now for the low points. My first warning sign came with an actual ""warning"" on the film. When it started the following ""warning"" was displayed: ""The film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images. Because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun, pretty or romantic."" I should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then. The first words of the film were: ""I'm at the glue factory."" It was some guy talking on his phone, and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. I don't know why. So the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and starts imitating him. The budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The acting was worse than me reading straight from a script. That's what is looked like they were doing. The script was horrible, and the big ""twist"" was that this guy who wrote a biography on the Zodiac Killer was actually the Zodiac Killer. Of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes. Without any more painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights of the movie. They try to make the Zodiac Killer compare himself to an ""army of one"" because soldiers are really just murderers. Then they tried to make an attempt at ""Satanic Worship"" by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting. The great ""computer hacker"" was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number. For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get someone address. I'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason. I also learned that no matter where you get shot, blood will come out of your mouth within seconds.<br /><br />So if you like really bad acting, sub-par scripts, bad camera work and an obvious plot, you'll love Zodiac Killer!",0,well ill start with the good points  the movie was only 86 minutes long  and some of it was so bad it was funny  now for the low points  my first warning sign came with an actual  warning  on the film  when it started the following  warning  was displayed   the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images  because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun  pretty or romantic   i should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then  the first words of the film were   im at the glue factory   it was some guy talking on his phone  and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory  i dont know why  so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him  the budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find  the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script  thats what is looked like they were doing  the script was horrible  and the big  twist  was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer  of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes  without any more painful details of the plot  here were some horrible highlights of the movie  they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an  army of one  because soldiers are really just murderers  then they tried to make an attempt at  satanic worship  by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting  the great  computer hacker  was able to get this kids address when someone gave him the kids name and phone number  for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address  im not sure why he didnt just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages com  there was also a random allusion to 9 11 for no reason  i also learned that no matter where you get shot  blood will come out of your mouth within seconds  so if you like really bad acting  sub par scripts  bad camera work and an obvious plot  youll love zodiac killer 
"With its companion piece MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS.<br /><br />Of course, part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience, instead aiming at TEN-YEAR-OLDS, who are only able to count body-bags, and scarcely that. And so grossness is king, and King is grossness.<br /><br />Stephen King is simply illiterate  in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of Bart Simpson. Since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies.<br /><br />True, the cinema is not such a bad place to start, since it has generally escaped the onslaught of ""Realism"". But these films are only the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you have to dig deeper.<br /><br />Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. But even so, it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi.<br /><br />At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something SCARY.<br /><br />Not, mind you, trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part, making the stupid stupider, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose, you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things! Wouldn't that be gross? And that, boys and girls, is the story.<br /><br />What about characterization? Oh yes, he's one of these suits, who never really appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he's shouting  well, they can't actually hear him, you know  he's saying that he's going to sue the hospital, but he's not such a big shot anymore, you see, lying there (or is it laying, I can never remember) and all. And he's thinking: Oh no please, please don't cut me and this is terrible, lying (or laying) like that  now, wouldn't that be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was that great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh yeah, a BOOMSLANG  has quite a ring to it, doesn't it.<br /><br />Let's make it a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, that's great  except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you moron! But how can you really tell that the target audience is children, and not simply mental defects? It's easy: There's no sex.<br /><br />Well, there is, but it's the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent's bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase.<br /><br />But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON they have no idea what's going on. All that's really left is the giggling outside the SM club and the Fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil.<br /><br />In spite of a certain discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her.<br /><br />And since there's no real titillation in that, he has to torture her first  not in any way that might excite her, you understand, since that would upset our puritan sentiments. And so, horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths.<br /><br />Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber gloves (giggle). And that's what they use in autopsies, and that's how they discover that he is, in fact, you know.<br /><br />Obviously, this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers.

"Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play so-so, with an exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like ""I want to *beep* you "" and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: ""Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?"" All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema. It was provoking, sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie, badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories.

"I'd just like to say that i've seen this film twice now and i love it! The acting is great and even though it is a similar plot to ""Raise Your Voice"" I think that the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing. It has some great lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything if we try. An incredible film. I am sure that this is one i will be watching for a long time to come. Even though Britney Spears write the book it is quite a realistic plot, maybe not about the falling in love part, but the part about being different and struggling but coming out best in the end is very true to real life. The only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average?

"Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. However, when ""Robotboy"" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled. The characters are generic and stereotypical (Do they REALLY need to make an African-American man wear tiger-stripe print clothing and speak in a Jamacian accent? WHY are all the Asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting? Does the mother HAVE to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, gross and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities to, even stabs, at Astro Boy. Allow me to explain (dub names for the young): Robotboy/Astro, Kamikaze/Tenma, Constantine/Shadow, Gus/Abercrombie, Tommy/Alejo, Lola/Zoran+Kennedy, Moshimo/O'Shay, and it so on. Brief resemblances to ""My Life As A Teenage Robot"", ""Star Wars"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", ""Kamen Riders"", ""Sailor Moon"" and co. are afoot. Not to mention the abundant racial/gender stereotyping. Don't even get me started on the innuendos. I'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Don't even try watching this.

"Pecker is another mainstream film by John Waters done on a smaller than Serial Mom. The title character of Pecker has a hobby of taking pictures of anything he sees. It doesn't matter if it's dirty or shocking when he takes pictures. He soon uses the pictures he taken and puts them on display at his work. Pecker live in a semi-normal middle-class family. His dad works at a drinking bar with a claw machine, but doesn't make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street. His mom runs a thrift shop and loves to dress-up poor people. His older sister, Tina, works at a gay bar where her specialty is trade. His younger, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar, and nothing but sugary food. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist with it. He also has 2 friends. On of his friends, Matt is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a laundry mat as if she was a dictator. Soon, a tourist from New York buys his pictures and displays them at an art gallery.

"***SPOILERS*** With a gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean, John Carradine, to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the Dean fortune, some 140 million dollars. The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion. There seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight sleepover, not a weeks vacation, at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise.<br /><br />The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia, Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests. Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and Laura's,Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders,little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond.<br /><br />The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is. We then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest. The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot, 140 million dollars, but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him, or her, in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot.<br /><br />Nonsensical who done it, and haunted house, movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother, much less the audience, would have trouble liking. There's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S&M sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder. You just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do.<br /><br />Even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself! We then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is. The final plot-twist, that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away, was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie.",0,   spoilers    with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean  john carradine  to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune  some 140 million dollars  the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion  there seemed to have been a mix up in the story when we later find out that its really an overnight sleepover  not a weeks vacation  at the mansion for the guests to qualify for deans money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise  the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia  rodolfo acosta  acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests  later that evening cute little chin greg and lauras jeff morrow   marry anders little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond  the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until its revealed who the killer really is  we then have what seems to be a double twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest  the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot  140 million dollars  but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him  or her  in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot  nonsensical who done it  and haunted house  movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother  much less the audience  would have trouble liking  theres everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest s m sadism and of course double dealing and back stabbing not even counting murder  you just couldnt care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do  even the big surprise at the end isnt really that much of a surprise since the killers identity is divulged with the film maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself  we then have a plot twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is  the final plot twist  that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away  was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie 
"i love bad shark movies. i really do. i laugh hysterically at them. and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them, culminating in the premier of their new original picture, hammerhead: shark frenzy. based on the previews, it looked like it was going to be HIGHLY amusing. essentially a remake of benchley's creature, really. it was prefaced by a showing of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is shark movie hilarity at its best. i was in the mood; i was ready to go. bring it on, hammerhead-mad-scientist-man! oh, god, was that movie wrong.<br /><br />wrong, wrong, wrong.<br /><br />sick. twisted.

"I really like this film... when I started to watch it I thought I would get bored pretty soon, but it surprised me... I thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now. The characters are believable and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green all over again (the first time being Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this film if you are a fan of his, but I do agree with another comment made earlier, that the ending is sort of disappointing. I would have loved it to turn out a little different!

"This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than week's worth of 'The Young & The Restless'. This one is more of a throwback to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy(especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than a D'Amato sleazefest. Chai Lee(Emy Wong)undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot-to-trot streetwalker. Future Italian porn star/politician, Illona Staller, who would later go by the name Ciccolina(and have sex with an HIV positive John Holmes) plays Emy's competition. Exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes round this one out.

"Generally I don't do minus's and if this site could i would give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll's alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion(Stephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit). Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win a Oscar for best movie if they were competing.<br /><br />Now to the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine but they've could have done better. The start looked OK but that's it I had to fast forward most of it because the death's where boring. I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths. I'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this. Sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this.. this.. thing of disaster. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake.<br /><br />Well sorry i couldn't explain the plot(if there was one) but that was the best i could.

"Horrendous pillaging of a classic.<br /><br />It wasn't written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates. He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him, but he still doesn't help himself at all with his actions. (inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues; lying about the knives, etc... ) This, in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him, but this somehow doesn't happen just so they can play the 'mistaken-identity-murder-game later on. Which in itself is also ridiculous: 'So-and-so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him! There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn't need extending.<br /><br />It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again, but that's about the only small pleasure to be had. It's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn't be bothering at all.",0,horrendous pillaging of a classic  it wasnt written convincingly at all why mary should develop such sympathy for bates  he may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him  but he still doesnt help himself at all with his actions   inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel  telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues  lying about the knives  etc      this  in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept mary extremely wary of him  but this somehow doesnt happen just so they can play the mistaken identity murder game later on  which in itself is also ridiculous  so and so is the real killer   plus her as well   also him  there were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didnt need extending  it was good to see perkins reprising his famous role again  but thats about the only small pleasure to be had  its definitely not a patch on hitchcock  and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldnt be bothering at all 
"I tend to like character-driven films. I also think Hope Davis turns in consistently good work, so I had high hopes for this movie. Those hopes were soon dashed.<br /><br />The main flaw with this movie is the direction. There are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences. The movie makes frequent use of the Denis Leary character as the alter ego of the Campbell Scott character. It doesn't work for me at all. This would have worked better as a play than a movie.<br /><br />There are problems with the plot as well. It is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. I didn't feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Finally, the editing wasn't well done, either. There was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring.<br /><br />Except for acting, which I felt was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.",0,i tend to like character driven films  i also think hope davis turns in consistently good work  so i had high hopes for this movie  those hopes were soon dashed  the main flaw with this movie is the direction  there are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences  the movie makes frequent use of the denis leary character as the alter ego of the campbell scott character  it doesnt work for me at all  this would have worked better as a play than a movie  there are problems with the plot as well  it is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started  i didnt feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie  finally  the editing wasnt well done  either  there was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring  except for acting  which i felt was consistently strong  this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema 
"I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think the ""Dark-Heart"" character is a little on the rough side and I don't like the way he shape-shifts into a ""mean"" frog, fox, boy I was wrong, This movie was made for my kid, not for me. She ""gets it"" when it went over (under?) my head. Of course I don't ""get it"". This isn't one of the NEW kids movies that adults will ALSO enjoy. This is straight for the young ones, and the crew knew what they were doing. There isn't any political junk ether. There's no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, nobody has the right to access excess, and everyone isn't happy all the time.

"I see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. The main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it. The camera work, ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which I could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasn't. The sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well. I see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but don't expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything, keep your expectations low and you'll get more out of it.

"The trouble with the book, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American man's way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, sets, and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters.<br /><br />The movie isn't about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about a few American men's mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it isn't about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then why make it into an American fantasy?<br /><br />There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups, no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. <br /><br />Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.<br /><br />Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?<br /><br />Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu didn't even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old-man stink, get his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?<br /><br />Let's try to make sense of this. By being behind Mameha the Chairman incurred debts for Sayuri's geisha training. In order to recoup his debts the Chairman had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha the Chairman sold Sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the Chairman could make some money out of her. The Chairman wasn't her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love story.<br /><br />Yes, the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive, alluring transvestite whose voice, appearance and every touch are thrilling. But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the incorrectly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film is entirely American and male. Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie, distortion, and terribly wrong.<br /><br />Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG:<br /><br />Japanese style  Refined, elegant simplicity. MOAG style  Peking Opera.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Hair swept up. MOAG geisha  Loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.<br /><br />Japanese shaved ice - Japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. MOAG shaved ice - The Chairman buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo, this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season. The thought made my entire body shiver with cold.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG geisha - sluts.<br /><br />Japanese wind chime - Used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes, thanks to the breeze, Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime - a door bell! If a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic, not gain entrance.<br /><br />Japan  Emphasis on human relationships, group oriented. MOAG  ""I want a life that's mine"" American individualism.<br /><br />Japanese traditional dance  Refined elegance. An almost geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dance  Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a not-very-auspicious white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?<br /><br />Japan house fire  Setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. Fires can rip through those wooden villages, towns, and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. MOAG house fire - Great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out. Technically the movie ended here because at the very least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.<br /><br />Enough.

"The first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is pleasant. The acting is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more evil than she was previously. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox",1,the first film was a nice one  but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing  this sequel is inferior  but not bad at all  sure the slapstick is too much  the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired  but the dogs are very cute here  and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw  the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes especially cruellas   and the music is pleasant  the acting is mostly very good  ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruellas accomplice  but the best asset  as it was with the first film  is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over the top performance as cruella  even more evil than she was previously  overall  nice  7 10 bethany cox

"I agree with the above comment, I love the realism in this, and in many movies (not just movies on eating disorders) the producers seem to forget that. They take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again, which I dislike because its not reality. Not meaning to say things can't get better, and not meaning to say things don't in this movie, but it doesn't spend most of the movie creating all these problems, and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again. When people have eating disorders people don't just admit it and want to get better, and then life is peachy, it takes time, and I like how in this movie we grow with the characters, we go through the difficulties with them, getting better and worse, because it is a very important part of the movie. It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders, and shows the complications and pain, in a very realistic way, and I loved that. I also love how it shows The secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders, it is scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve of it. I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told, and defiantly one of my favourites.",1,i agree with the above comment  i love the realism in this  and in many movies  not just movies on eating disorders  the producers seem to forget that  they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again  which i dislike because its not reality  not meaning to say things cant get better  and not meaning to say things dont in this movie  but it doesnt spend most of the movie creating all these problems  and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again  when people have eating disorders people dont just admit it and want to get better  and then life is peachy  it takes time  and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters  we go through the difficulties with them  getting better and worse  because it is a very important part of the movie  it gets into the minds of people with eating disorders  and shows the complications and pain  in a very realistic way  and i loved that  i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders  it is scary to see how people react when they find out  especially if they approve of it  i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told  and defiantly one of my favourites

The paramount statement of the entire movie is ""Take Action"" on the problem . Incredibly emotional movie. I would highly recommend this movie to the vet the vets entire mature family and ask that they follow through with a plan to listen comfort help the returning Gulf War Enduring Freedom vets.<br /><br />Fast forward nearly one year later & My daughter has seen this DVD.

"I'll keep this short, as I know I don't need to say much.<br /><br />""Alive"" is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some, but I found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning. The film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I found Kitamura's ""Alive"" to be anything but - a lame, extremely boring drama disguised as a thought-provoking action sci-fi flick. I felt like I was suckered into watching this film, based by its intriguing premise and uber-exciting cover art.<br /><br />My suggestion? Pass it up for Kitamura's far more enjoyable freshman effort ""Versus"" or his 2004 riot ""Godzilla: Final Wars"".<br /><br />...And don't get me wrong, I'm always up for a good thinking man's film, but this certainly wasn't it.

"I am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy. Attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid between On Golden Pond and The Prince of Tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. The main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between Garry Marshall's sentimental direction and Mark Andrus' dark, rather confusing screenplay. The story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have driven all the way from San Francisco to small-town Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under Georgia's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion.<br /><br />The set-up is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. It veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. The three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. Probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker's voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachel's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. Felicity Huffman is forced to play Lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter's state of mind. She does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being.<br /><br />At close to seventy, Jane Fonda looks great, even as weather-beaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty Georgia. The problem I have with Fonda's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares. Between this and 2005's execrable Monster-in-Law, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. It should come as no surprise that the actresses' male counterparts are completely overshadowed. Garrett Hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve Harlan, a devout Mormon whose sudden love for Rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint. Cary Elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as Lilly's husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie's ending.<br /><br />There is also the omnipresent Dermot Mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower, Lilly's former flame and Rachel's new boss as town veterinarian Dr. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf has a barely-there role as Simon's sister Paula, while Marshall regular Hector Elizondo and songsmith Paul Williams show up in cameos. Some of Andrus' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. There are several small extras with the 2007 DVD, none all too exciting. Marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. There are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. A seven-minute making-of featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to Marshall.",0,i am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy  attempting to be a new millennium cross hybrid between on golden pond and the prince of tides  this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off  the main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between garry marshalls sentimental direction and mark andrus dark  rather confusing screenplay  the story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother lilly and daughter rachel  who have driven all the way from san francisco to small town hull  idaho where grandmother georgia lives  the idea is for lilly to leave rachel for the summer under georgias taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17 year old has become an incorrigible hellion  the set up is clear enough  but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline  it veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism  child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution  the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees  probably due to her off screen reputation and her scratchy smokers voice  lindsay lohan makes rachels promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable  although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior  felicity huffman is forced to play lilly on two strident notes   as a petulant  resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry  alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughters state of mind  she does what she can with the role on both fronts  but her efforts never add up to a flesh and blood human being  at close to seventy  jane fonda looks great  even as weather beaten as she is here  and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon like dimensions of the flinty georgia  the problem i have with fondas casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one liners and maternal stares  between this and 2005s execrable monster in law  it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her  it should come as no surprise that the actresses male counterparts are completely overshadowed  garrett hedlund looks a little too surfer dude as the naïve harlan  a devout mormon whose sudden love for rachel could delay his two year missionary stint  cary elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as lillys husband  an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movies ending  there is also the omnipresent dermot mulroney in the morose triple play role of the wounded widower  lillys former flame and rachels new boss as town veterinarian dr  simon ward  laurie metcalf has a barely there role as simons sister paula  while marshall regular hector elizondo and songsmith paul williams show up in cameos  some of andrus dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right  there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd  none all too exciting  marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor  there are several deleted scenes  including three variations on the ending  and a gag reel  a seven minute making of featurette is included  as well as the original theatrical trailer  a six minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five minute tribute to marshall 
"...and you can look at that statement in different ways, by the way. First of all, it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick, disgusting, offensive, brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now, I love horror movies and I am very 'pro-violence', but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The ""movie"" contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture, murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative, if you ask me. And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally, I think that is an interesting topic, so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever.<br /><br />Secondly, the whole production of this movie was a mess. They didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...Tons of it !! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I've ever seen. Any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash, for example ). There's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one.<br /><br />Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...Bah. I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind.

"Okay, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I've voted for ""10"" to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo's who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews. Each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers... three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big-time Hollywood productions. Performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive, with notable turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe-lamp, and Lance August seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim. But overall, it's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments.

"The Brain (or head) that Wouldn't Die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead, Ginny Leith - a detached head kept alive by machines, I-Vs and clamps - seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes. Shades of the under-rated Boxing Helena.<br /><br />The genderisms are plentiful, and about as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialog is hyperbolic, over-dramatic and unbelievable, and the acting is merely OK (but not consistent). Why have I given this film a 4? Because some thought clearly went into it. I am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror (without the blood and guts today's audiences expect).<br /><br />Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film, and none of the characters are particularly likable.<br /><br />All considered, this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality, from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash. Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh, high quality, body onto her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably non-plussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the 1950s/60s cliché about the evils of science run amok.<br /><br />Recommended for B sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies.

"Well - when the cameo appearance of Jason Miller (looking even more eroded than he did in Exorcist IV) is the high point of a picture, what've you got?<br /><br />It's a little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll: mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog-dried mummy (have you figured that one out yet - DRIED in a bog?) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad dye job, and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they'd developed her.<br /><br />I understand - sort of - that they're going back to visit her relatives. After that....<br /><br />Problem: There are several interesting flashbacks to what I must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing (I think). This is never connected to anything. <br /><br />Problem: What do we need the grandmother for? Now, the grandmother could be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can make something of her. The best they can do is that she 's got a tobacco habit. That's all.<br /><br />Problem: They cast a real shifty character as the husband. Is he type-cast (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her)or is he cast against type (after all, he has a good haircut and nice clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He's not a bad guy. Not a good one. But dislikable. Why didn't they DO something with him?<br /><br />No problem: an old boyfriend shows up. The husband knocks him down. He comes back to knock down the husband. (It gets pretty stupid, but at least THAT character has motivation.) <br /><br />NOW - she's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; he might only have married her for her money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch (are you following this?) who may come to life. In fact, you KNOW she'll come to life, the music swells. A little girl lives in the house, takes tea to the grandmother (unlocks the door to do so) and provides granny with cigarettes. Periodically, granny gets out. But nothing happens. <br /><br />Husband and wife lose the kid in the house, subsequently lose their bedroom. Uncle gets his throat cut in the basement. The leading lady has nose-bleeds. The husband drinks. They both drink. In the face of all of this, the awful truth alluded to in the first over-voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old.<br /><br />In spite of all these dangling-thread ingredients, nobody managed to get a story on the screen. No bridge between situations, no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror, just long slow scenes that go nowhere.;nbody, really, to care about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunks,the grandmother who might be locked up because she's a monster, but no, her worst fault is smoking. She's got great hair, good makeup. <br /><br />In short, no plot. Just a little random (predictable)violence in a dark library, with the rain gushing in, and the sound track cuing us in. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie.<br /><br />The production values were good. Oh. Nice scenery, good wardrobe.

"Well, after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments I had long awaited to see this film. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into an apartment building that's a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a down right creepy film, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The acting is fine, and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing The ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals. It's a very odd, campy but in the end, I truly believe a great film! One of my favorites from the 70's, even if it's nothing greatly original. It's wacky and extremely creepy! Probably one of my all time favorites. 9/10",1,well  after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravos the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film  the plot was simple  beautiful model alison parker  cristina raines  moves into an apartment building thats a gateway to hell  the sentinel is a down right creepy film  even if its a bit slow  its a mix of the omen and rosemarys baby  the acting is fine  and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals  its a very odd  campy but in the end  i truly believe a great film  one of my favorites from the 70s  even if its nothing greatly original  its wacky and extremely creepy  probably one of my all time favorites  9 10
"I can watch a good gory film now and then. I've seen some pretty sick stuff. However, this is one of the few films that I found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting. I like gore films when they are fun. I like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this film is not creative. It is sick. It is repugnant. It is completely unpleasant. Because of this, this film is certainly not entertaining. The film is a horror film, but it lacks scares. So pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore, but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film, and that's saying a lot. The acting is terrible, the plot makes no sense, and the music is really annoying and WAY too electronic sounding. It all took me right out of the film. Pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal. There's this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off. I guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process. There's some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog, some dismembered head floating down a stream, and an ending involving a man being electrocuted. There were times where I tried really hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole film that I thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, nasty, ad unappealing horror films, this one is for you.",0,i can watch a good gory film now and then  ive seen some pretty sick stuff  however  this is one of the few films that i found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting  i like gore films when they are fun  i like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them  the gore in this film is not creative  it is sick  it is repugnant  it is completely unpleasant  because of this  this film is certainly not entertaining  the film is a horror film  but it lacks scares  so pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore  but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film  and thats saying a lot  the acting is terrible  the plot makes no sense  and the music is really annoying and way too electronic sounding  it all took me right out of the film  pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal  theres this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off  i guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process  theres some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog  some dismembered head floating down a stream  and an ending involving a man being electrocuted  there were times where i tried really hard to enjoy it  but the only scene in the whole film that i thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion  if you like ugly  nasty  ad unappealing horror films  this one is for you 
"This enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast, and many memorable scenes. The big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And to top it all off Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet, and talk in wildly different accents, is a real hoot! And I guess, seeing as how they were alone, that they should actually have been speaking in Spanish anyway! It seems pretty weird that the Brothers Warner couldn't find any Spanish speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course Hollywood has often had an ""any old accent will do"" policy - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have got Novarro for ""Confidential Agent"" - he would have been great in Boyer's role or at least in Francen's (which would have saved greatly on the dark make-up budget).",1,this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast  and many memorable scenes  the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents  the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman  boyer   a belgian  francen   a greek  paxinou  and a hungarian  lorre   and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat  despite these absurdities  the performances are all very good   especially those of paxinou and lorre  but the scene in which boyer  paxinou and lorre meet  and talk in wildly different accents  is a real hoot  and i guess  seeing as how they were alone  that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway  it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldnt find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles  of course hollywood has often had an  any old accent will do  policy   my other favorite is greta garbo  swedish  as mata hari  dutch   who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican  ramon novarro   maybe they should have got novarro for  confidential agent    he would have been great in boyers role or at least in francens  which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget  
"Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....<br /><br />SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /><br />Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.<br /><br />But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat.<br /><br />Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.<br /><br />OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.<br /><br />Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's ""failure"". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. <br /><br />This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).<br /><br />It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. <br /><br />It is to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.",0,somebody owes ang lee an apology  actually  a lot of people do  and ill start  i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk  because of the near

"I'm not a big fan of the Stooges' slapstick, but I find their history interesting. I've recently tried to check out stuff from each Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe shorts doesn't seem to come easy; this is the only one I've seen so far.<br /><br />Some say the quality problems with Joe-era shorts are really not Joe's fault, and I suspect that's the case. Joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this. The thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment: the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedy-team/Stooges ethos. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived, by those in charge, as not really fitting in -- though there were no real off-camera conflicts between him & the others -- and this was their way of working around that.<br /><br />And what's with the titles of this and some of the other late Stooges shorts? Definitely a lack of creativity going on there; was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market drying up?",0,im not a big fan of the stooges slapstick  but i find their history interesting  ive recently tried to check out stuff from each stooge era  but the opportunity to see joe shorts doesnt seem to come easy  this is the only one ive seen so far  some say the quality problems with joe era shorts are really not joes fault  and i suspect thats the case  joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this  the thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment  the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedy team stooges ethos  perhaps joes style was perceived  by those in charge  as not really fitting in    though there were no real off camera conflicts between him   the others    and this was their way of working around that  and whats with the titles of this and some of the other late stooges shorts  definitely a lack of creativity going on there  was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market drying up 
"Me neither, but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful, which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time. There's nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie, and My Name is Modesty: Whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level. It's full of B-actors but isn't any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously. It sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing-up drama, flashback style. The beautiful Alexandra Staden, smothered beyond recognition under makeup, more resembles a cast member from Top Model than Modesty Blaise. I'm not one of those die-hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious ""graphic novels"" to be pitch-perfect - in fact I've never even read Modesty Blaise - all I wanted was a decent movie to watch. But this wasn't it. The film feels half-finished, with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot. It also takes its audience for idiots, explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago (I guess they think we all have Alzheimers).<br /><br />Now I love a good B-movie - what's better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a Calzone? - and ""Modesty"" is directed by none other than Scott Spiegel, who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money! I loved From Dusk Till Dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad B-movie should bring to the table - nudity, gore, guns, you name it. ""Modesty"" is just dull. The flashback concerning Modesty's life isn't interesting. The acting isn't bad enough to be laughed at. In fact, I kinda liked Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's (hey buddy, pseudonyms are your friends!) performance as the baddie.<br /><br />So overall it's just lame. Weak. Uninspired. Call it what you will. Don't watch anything because Tarantino presents it, people. This is just a very forgettable, half-hearted thriller, and it never tries to be more than that. Allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun (seriously, even I'm cringing): My Name Is Modesty: A Modesty Waste of Time - 4/10",0,me neither  but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful  which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time  theres nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie  and my name is modesty  whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level  its full of b actors but isnt any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously  it sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing up drama  flashback style  the beautiful alexandra staden  smothered beyond recognition under makeup  more resembles a cast member from top model than modesty blaise  im not one of those die hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious  graphic novels  to be pitch perfect   in fact ive never even read modesty blaise   all i wanted was a decent movie to watch  but this wasnt it  the film feels half finished  with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot  it also takes its audience for idiots  explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago  i guess they think we all have alzheimers   now i love a good b movie   whats better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a calzone    and  modesty  is directed by none other than scott spiegel  who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick from dusk till dawn 2  texas blood money  i loved from dusk till dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad b movie should bring to the table   nudity  gore  guns  you name it   modesty  is just dull  the flashback concerning modestys life isnt interesting  the acting isnt bad enough to be laughed at  in fact  i kinda liked nikolaj coaster waldaus  hey buddy  pseudonyms are your friends   performance as the baddie  so overall its just lame  weak  uninspired  call it what you will  dont watch anything because tarantino presents it  people  this is just a very forgettable  half hearted thriller  and it never tries to be more than that  allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun  seriously  even im cringing   my name is modesty  a modesty waste of time   4 10

"The penultimate episode of Star Trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season. Essentially, Spock, McCoy and Kirk beam down to Sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and Mr. Atoz, the librarian. All 3 Trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of Sarpeidon's past. Spock gives a convincing performance as an Ice Age Vulcan who falls in love for Zarabeth while Kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the 'City on the Edge of Forever'--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to Sarpeidon's present. In the end, all 3 Trek characters are saved mere minutes before the Beta Niobe star around Sarpeidon goes supernova. The Enterprise warps away just as the star explodes.<br /><br />Ironically, as William Shatner notes in his book ""Star Trek Memories,"" this show was the source of some dispute since Leonard Nimoy noticed that no reason was given in Lisette's script for the reason why Spock was behaving in such an emotional way. Nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer, Fred Freiberger, that Vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love. (p.272) However, Freiberger reasoned, the ice age setting allowed Spock to experience emotions since this was a time when Vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state. This was a great example of improvisation on Freiberger's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode. While Shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt Spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in ""Plato's Stepchildren,"" play music with Hippies in ""the Way to Eden"" or sometimes display emotion, the script here was more believable. Spock's acting here was excellent as Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner. (p.272) The only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both Spock and McCoy travelled thousands of years back in time, McCoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state, not just Spock. But this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows, the brilliant Spock/McCoy performance and the originality of this script. Who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of Sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past? This is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'Classic Trek'--a genuinely inspired story. <br /><br />Shatner, in 'Memories', named some of his best ""unusual and high quality shows"" of season 3 as The Enterprise Incident, Day of the Dove, Is there in Truth no Beauty, The Tholian Web, And the children Shall Lead and The Paradise Syndrome. (p.273) While my personal opinion is that 'And the children Shall Lead' is a very poor episode while 'Is there in Truth no Beauty' is problematic, ""All Our Yesterdays"" certainly belongs on the list of top season three Star Trek TOS films. I give a 9 out of 10 for 'All Our Yesterdays.'",1,the penultimate episode of star treks third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season  essentially  spock  mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planets population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr  atoz  the librarian  all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidons past  spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel  see the city on the edge of forever  when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidons present  in the end  all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova  the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes  ironically  as william shatner notes in his book  star trek memories   this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisettes script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way  nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the shows executive producer  fred freiberger  that vulcans werent supposed to fall in love   p 272  however  freiberger reasoned  the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state  this was a great example of improvisation on freibergers part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode  while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in  platos stepchildren   play music with hippies in  the way to eden  or sometimes display emotion  the script here was more believable  spocks acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner   p 272  the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time  mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state  not just spock  but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows  the brilliant spock mccoy performance and the originality of this script  who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planets fate by travelling into their past  this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of classic trek  a genuinely inspired story   shatner  in memories  named some of his best  unusual and high quality shows  of season 3 as the enterprise incident  day of the dove  is there in truth no beauty  the tholian web  and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome   p 273  while my personal opinion is that and the children shall lead is a very poor episode while is there in truth no beauty is problematic   all our yesterdays  certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films  i give a 9 out of 10 for all our yesterdays

"Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of Zola. Muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs - know anything about it. He was a giant in the business for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur the year before. My own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the ""Golden Age."" Whatever part he played; you were riveted to the screen watching him.<br /><br />Unlike the Pasteur role, I thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years: going overboard to make a Liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood couldn't suppress its disdain for police or for the military, here making it a point to tell us how ""corrupt"" those organizations are. Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In that regard, this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this big-time since the 1960s.<br /><br />However, it must be noted the facts support this story. It also does not in any way diminish Zola's accomplishments as a social reformer, getting rid of certain evils. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing that, than concentrating on one trial.",0,kudos to the patience of paul muni  who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of zola  muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and i wonder how many people today  other than classic movie buffs   know anything about it  he was a giant in the business for at least a decade  he could have won the academy award for this performance  which would have given him two in a row  as he won it for playing louis pasteur the year before  my own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit  i still think he was one of the great actors of the  golden age   whatever part he played  you were riveted to the screen watching him  unlike the pasteur role  i thought this story smacked of a little too much of what weve seen in the last 60 years  going overboard to make a liberal hero  even in 1937  hollywood couldnt suppress its disdain for police or for the military  here making it a point to tell us how  corrupt  those organizations are  filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated  in that regard  this film is way ahead of its day since weve seen this big time since the 1960s  however  it must be noted the facts support this story  it also does not in any way diminish zolas accomplishments as a social reformer  getting rid of certain evils  good for him  i wish they had spent more time showing that  than concentrating on one trial 
"may contain spoilers!!!! so i watched this movie last night on LMN (Lifetime Movie Network) which is NOT known for showing quality movies. THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing, as it was terrible. could this movie contain any more stereotypes? (harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor, catholic family with priest sons, big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family's house, mexican whores, ""bad"" guy who is really a softie at heart, incredibly bad country accents) GAG!!!! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it, i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it. anyway, the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick's beauty. i suppose pollack's and nemec's acting is okay, but they have a horrid script to work with. unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents (the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang) i think that the accents were there (in supporting characters like mary margaret's date and john) and were unnecessary. they were also very very bad. i am so very tired of hollywood ""southern"" accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from. and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive, i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town: the beautiful capitol building, the UT tower lit up for a winning football game, etc. none of these things were there. also, it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin. at one point in the movie, michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark (during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until 9pm or so), spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican (is there any other kind?) whores, and then return to austin by dawn. while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely. and if anyone has started school in the hill country (usually the third week of august, but may have been in september in 1960) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets!!!!! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90+ degrees. only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school. all in all, a very bad made for tv movie experience.",0,may contain spoilers     so i watched this movie last night on lmn  lifetime movie network  which is not known for showing quality movies  this movie is awful  i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing  as it was terrible  could this movie contain any more stereotypes   harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor  catholic family with priest sons  big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic familys house  mexican whores   bad  guy who is really a softie at heart  incredibly bad country accents  gag     i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it  i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it  anyway  the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amicks beauty  i suppose pollacks and nemecs acting is okay  but they have a horrid script to work with  unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents  the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang  i think that the accents were there  in supporting characters like mary margarets date and john  and were unnecessary  they were also very very bad  i am so very tired of hollywood  southern  accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from  and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive  i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town  the beautiful capitol building  the ut tower lit up for a winning football game  etc  none of these things were there  also  it takes about 5 6 hours to drive to mexico from austin  at one point in the movie  michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark  during the summer and early fall it doesnt get dark in austin until 9pm or so   spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican  is there any other kind   whores  and then return to austin by dawn  while this is theoretically possible it is not very likely  and if anyone has started school in the hill country  usually the third week of august  but may have been in september in 1960  they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they do not wear their letter jackets      in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90  degrees  only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school  all in all  a very bad made for tv movie experience 
"The BFG is one of Roald Dahl's most cherished books, but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there. This version remains pretty faithful to Dahl's original story so one can't lay the blame on John Hambley's script. If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice-overs. One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy, vibrant, fun-filled movie..... instead, the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch. Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children's' classic.<br /><br />Young orphan Sophie (voice of Amanda Root) lives in a none-too-friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of Mrs Clonkers. One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street. The figure realises it has been seen, so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night. Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country, and fears that he will eat her. But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG (voice of David Jason). The BFG refuses to eat people, instead restricting himself to foul-tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers. However, Giant Country is populated by numerous other giants who DO feast - every night, as it happens - on poor unsuspecting humans. Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants. Together they go to the Queen of England (voice of Angela Thorne) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man-eating giants. The Queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else.<br /><br />Jason voices the BFG quite well (one of the few pluses in the film) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality. The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired, with very little to bring the characters to life. Similarly, the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated - Sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed (and look almost indistinguishable from each other). Even the places are uninventive; Giant Country especially comes up short, being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons. At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy, yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences. Little of Dahl's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily. One chapter in the book deals with the BFG's love of ""whizzpopping"" (farting) and is laugh-out-loud hilarious. In the film, the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling. I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what I got was pretty much the opposite! This one is a failed misfire that simply doesn't match the calibre of the book in any department - unfortunately, therefore, it must go down as one to skip.",0,the bfg is one of roald dahls most cherished books  but in this animated adaptation the magic just isnt there  this version remains pretty faithful to dahls original story so one cant lay the blame on john hambleys script  if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation  the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice overs  one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy  vibrant  fun filled movie      instead  the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch  children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first  all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a childrens classic  young orphan sophie  voice of amanda root  lives in a none too friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers  one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street  the figure realises it has been seen  so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed  placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night  sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country  and fears that he will eat her  but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg  voice of david jason   the bfg refuses to eat people  instead restricting himself to foul tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers  however  giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast   every night  as it happens   on poor unsuspecting humans  sophie and the bfg become great friends  and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants  together they go to the queen of england  voice of angela thorne  with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man eating giants  the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else  jason voices the bfg quite well  one of the few pluses in the film  but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality  the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired  with very little to bring the characters to life  similarly  the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated   sophie lacks appeal  and the giants are boringly designed  and look almost indistinguishable from each other   even the places are uninventive  giant country especially comes up short  being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons  at 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy  yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences  little of dahls mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily  one chapter in the book deals with the bfgs love of  whizzpopping   farting  and is laugh out loud hilarious  in the film  the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling  i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest  fun and enjoyment  but what i got was pretty much the opposite  this one is a failed misfire that simply doesnt match the calibre of the book in any department   unfortunately  therefore  it must go down as one to skip 
"And the Oscar for the most under-rated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as Karloff, Lugosi, and Price, and this movie proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie.<br /><br />The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession myself I have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self-pity prone hypochondriac. Though other ""medical mistakes"" did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication... ""Well continue giving it to her"" Unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie. The plot is predictable with only few minor twists. The filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn - yes you can use too much shadow.<br /><br />My recommendation - watch this once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine.",0,and the oscar for the most under rated classic horror actor goes to   dwight frye  seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff  lugosi  and price  and this movie proves it  his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie  dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie  the other reason is the comic relief of m  eburne  being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self pity prone hypochondriac  though other  medical mistakes  did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication     well continue giving it to her  unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie  the plot is predictable with only few minor twists  the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn   yes you can use too much shadow  my recommendation   watch this once to see frye and eburne   but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine 
"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that holds a viewer's interest time and again. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop. True, all the drama is melodrama; but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: ""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" I think it's unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.",1,this is one of those movies   like dave  american dreamer and local hero   that holds a viewers interest time and again  lightweight movies seldom win oscars  but whoever did the casting for soapdish deserves one  even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming  its still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop  true  all the drama is melodrama  but thats entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background  my favorite line comes from whoopi goldberg   now why cant i write sh t like that   i think its unfortunate that the tv and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation 
"Prolific and highly influential filmmaker Martin Scorsese examines a selection of his favorite American films grouped according to three different types of directors: the director as an illusionist: D.W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward; the director as a smuggler: filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and mostly Vincente Minnelli, directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films; and the director as iconoclast: those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang-ups like Orson Welles, Erich von Stroheim, Charles Chaplin, Nicholas Ray, Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur Penn.<br /><br />He shows us how the old studio system in Hollywood was, though oppressive, the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations. During his clips from the movies he shows us, we not only discover films we've never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees. He evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves.<br /><br />The idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish, hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make ""lists."" However, canon merely denotes ""the best"" and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the ""best"" films, a lot like a greatest hits tape, if just as a beginning direction for film students. All in all, one's experience has shown that all writing about film, including reviews, function to construct a film canon. Some film canons can definitely be elitist, but others can be ""populist."" As an example, the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 Movies list includes many films included on several ""elitist"" film canons but also features recent Hollywood blockbusters at which many film ""elitists"" scoff, like The Dark Knight, which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two Godfather films, Schindler's List and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as Iron Man, Sin City, Die Hard, The Terminator and Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Writer Scorsese's Taxi Driver Paul Schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as ""elitist"" and contends that this is positive.<br /><br />Scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies, but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of American cinema in both ideological realms, we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism. Elitism concentrates all attention, recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding. That discrimination could easily lead to self-indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of Jean-Luc Godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like Michael Haneke. Yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people's will. As has been previously asserted about the all-encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema, populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema. One can only continue seeing films, because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice. And that's what Martin Scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us, something which can't be told without being seen first-hand.",1,prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese examines a selection of his favorite american films grouped according to three different types of directors  the director as an illusionist  d w  griffith or f  w  murnau  who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward  the director as a smuggler  filmmakers such as douglas sirk  samuel fuller  and mostly vincente minnelli  directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films  and the director as iconoclast  those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang ups like orson welles  erich von stroheim  charles chaplin  nicholas ray  stanley kubrick  and arthur penn  he shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was  though oppressive  the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations  during his clips from the movies he shows us  we not only discover films weve never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees  he evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves  the idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish  hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make  lists   however  canon merely denotes  the best  and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the  best  films  a lot like a greatest hits tape  if just as a beginning direction for film students  all in all  ones experience has shown that all writing about film  including reviews  function to construct a film canon  some film canons can definitely be elitist  but others can be  populist   as an example  the internet movie databases top 250 movies list includes many films included on several  elitist  film canons but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film  elitists  scoff  like the dark knight  which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films  schindlers list and one flew over the cuckoos nest  and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as iron man  sin city  die hard  the terminator and kill bill  vol  2  writer scorseses taxi driver paul schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as  elitist  and contends that this is positive  scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies  but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both ideological realms  we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism  elitism concentrates all attention  recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding  that discrimination could easily lead to self indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of jean luc godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael haneke  yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the peoples will  as has been previously asserted about the all encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema  populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema  one can only continue seeing films  because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice  and thats what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us  something which cant be told without being seen first hand

I own copies of both ""Dragons"" and ""The Hobbit"" (both excellent) and I hadn't seen ""The Last Unicorn"" in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I hadn't. What bothered me the most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often inane. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. We're not just talking about little things here either; we're talking about key plot points! The story itself isn't that great to begin with, but it could have worked had the script been decent. Not even close. On top of that the music was awful! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball.

"Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's straight to video throw away sequels. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2) I was glad that Disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull. To break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences, which much like the jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part the MST3K-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really don't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback. The new characters are at least likable, and the old characters are out doing their thing so I can't fault them there. Overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles.",1,surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disneys straight to video throw away sequels  like the previous sequel  the lion king 2  i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation  the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull  to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences  which much like the jokes  range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge  for the most part the mst3k like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really dont add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour long flashback  the new characters are at least likable  and the old characters are out doing their thing so i cant fault them there  overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious lion king titles 
"""Boom"" has garnered itself a something of a reputation. With heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad could it be? Well, it's a lot worse than you could possibly imagine.<br /><br />The sad and disturbing fact of ""Boom"" is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights. It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with ""Modesty Blaise"" and ""Boom"" (some may wish to add ""Secret Ceremony""), managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work, the wonderful ""Go-Between"".<br /><br />Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid forties until the early sixties, Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status, remaining in theater repertory throughout the world, many becoming much praised films. When William's muse deserted him, probably owing to his notorious substance abuse, it deserted him for good. Williams at his best is an actor's dream providing many unforgettable performances. (Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in ""Night of the Iguana"" ? ) Taylor in particular, shone in both ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and ""Suddenly Last Summer"". There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied ""if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams"". Had Gielgud seen ""Boom"" he would have held his tongue. Taylor simply has never been worse, turning in a cringe inducing performance. Despite her face photographing well, she is decidedly podgy. Besides the physical decline, from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable (and worse) roles to her credit.<br /><br />Much the same could be said of Burton.

"A young solicitor from London, Arthur Kidd is sent to a small coastal town of Crythin Gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow Mrs Drablow. While attending her funeral, a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention. Supposedly Drablow lived a reclusive life, and locals kept pretty quiet about her. After this he heads to Mrs Drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide. There he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house, and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes. Now can Mrs Drablow's belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help Kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about.<br /><br />Often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and I can see their point. But only in doses does it draw upon tag. Yes, from what you can gather I was left a 'little' under-whelmed, despite really liking it. I was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature, but that's probably it expecting. Mainly I had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller 'The Changeling'. When you hear so many good things, it's sometimes hard not get caught up with it.<br /><br />Anyhow what the British TV presentation of ""The Woman in Black"" effectively does is bring out a truly old-fashion, slow burn spine-tingling premise driven by its moody locations, disquieting atmosphere and first-rate performances. Subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story (adapted off Susan Hill's novel of the same name), as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist. Little seems to happen, and can feel drawn out, but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard. Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black. Who mostly appears as a background figure, it's ultimately creepy. She might not appear all that much, but when she does. Talk about unnerving! That also goes for that downbeat conclusion. Pauline Moran, who plays the woman in black, competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning. A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you. She's a spirit you don't want to cross paths with, yet alone let her see you. An accomplished performance by a marvelously moody Adrian Rawlins as the solicitor Arthur Kidd does hold it all together. In support are solid turns by Bernard Hepton, David Daker, Clare Holman and David Ryall.<br /><br />Drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn, time-worn Victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear. Director Herbert Wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well-judged contriving. Instead of going out to shock us, some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won't let go. The sound effects are masterfully used, by surrounding and disorienting the air. Rachel Portman's harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you.<br /><br />This rarity made-for-television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook-fest. It might not share much new to the sub-genre, but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse.",1,a young solicitor from london  arthur kidd is sent to a small coastal town of crythin gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow mrs drablow  while attending her funeral  a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention  supposedly drablow lived a reclusive life  and locals kept pretty quiet about her  after this he heads to mrs drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide  there he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house  and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes  now can mrs drablows belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about  often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and i can see their point  but only in doses does it draw upon tag  yes  from what you can gather i was left a little under whelmed  despite really liking it  i was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature  but thats probably it expecting  mainly i had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller the changeling  when you hear so many good things  its sometimes hard not get caught up with it  anyhow what the british tv presentation of  the woman in black  effectively does is bring out a truly old fashion  slow burn spine tingling premise driven by its moody locations  disquieting atmosphere and first rate performances  subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story  adapted off susan hills novel of the same name   as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist  little seems to happen  and can feel drawn out  but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard  whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black  who mostly appears as a background figure  its ultimately creepy  she might not appear all that much  but when she does  talk about unnerving  that also goes for that downbeat conclusion  pauline moran  who plays the woman in black  competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning  a pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you  shes a spirit you dont want to cross paths with  yet alone let her see you  an accomplished performance by a marvelously moody adrian rawlins as the solicitor arthur kidd does hold it all together  in support are solid turns by bernard hepton  david daker  clare holman and david ryall  drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn  time worn victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear  director herbert wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well judged contriving  instead of going out to shock us  some scenes contain a distressing intensity that wont let go  the sound effects are masterfully used  by surrounding and disorienting the air  rachel portmans harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you  this rarity made for television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook fest  it might not share much new to the sub genre  but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse 
"Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family!<br /><br />Before the real story of the movie starts, we get a performance of the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and it kicks off a great movie. After that we get a kind of a collage of Michael carrier, as it was until Moonwalker came out in 1988. After a few Music Videos also (Speed Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) the story starts.<br /><br />The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (who are kids) are being chased by the bad guy of the story ""Mr. Big"", because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs. During the chase we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the kids get kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict.<br /><br />During the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards, but also impressive today. For instance, see Michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends! It's so cool!<br /><br />The movie ends with a performance of Come Together (later published in Michaels double-album of HIStory), and you leave the movie with a magic feeling. Amazing!<br /><br />I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents might stand up and say: ""But Michael Jackson is an alleged child abuser!"" Yeah, he is indeed, but, come on, we all know it isn't true!

"What's inexplicable? Firstly, the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It's a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.<br /><br />But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10.<br /><br />p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.",1,whats inexplicable  firstly  the hatred towards this movie  it may not be the greatest movie of all time  but gimme a break  it got 11 oscars for a reason  it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason  its a damn good movie  which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it  i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters  ive rewatched it on tv and video  and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen  twice  or maybe three times  actually   but that might be it  the appeal of it  its a movie  yes  capital m there  its an epic  its a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur  now  ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me  with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama  not that titanic has none of that  well  the acting was actually very good  the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times  but the reason titanic works is that its such an emotional ride  i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind  or give me a visual thrill  this movie isnt exactly dumb  but its not cerebral at all  the visual thrills are simply means to an end  to fuel the emotions of the audience  i didnt cry when bambis mom died  i dont react to tearjerkers  but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million  an emotional rollercoaster that  if it were a regular one  would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl  and im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it  and have a ready supply of cynicism  then you can thoroughly dislike this movie  but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit  if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt  youll enjoy it completely  and look at the top ten grossing films of all time  is a single one of them bad  is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10  no  not even the phantom menace  and this movie made 1 8 billion dollars worldwide  it cant be bad  not possible  10 10  p s  how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman  spiderman was a fun movie  but it was a total 9 11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did  it simply wasnt anything all that special  no one will remember it in 50 years  but im pretty sure titanic will be remembered

"This documentary explores a story covered in Pilger's latest book ""Freedom Next Time"", which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />The islanders are technically British citizens, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, much like Mauritius, the nearby island to where the natives were exiled, used to be. But the British government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the United States army, who have used it as a basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews all round are excellent, and his cornering of a Parliament representative where he uses the Government's own information to pin him down, ranks as one of his best.<br /><br />Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives. The weaving of this footage with the interviews, and the islanders music, really heightens the film's impact.<br /><br />It is not easy viewing, but ""Stealing a Nation"" is John Pilger at his best.

"What's the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying I've just come direct from viewing this movie, and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and I don't think they'll be moving any time soon.<br /><br />It's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it. If not, let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate-budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la ""Near Dark"", nor is it a low budget, schlocky, ""fun"" B-movie. What it is it low-budget art, put forward in a simple yet poignant way. The idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around, and ending in, suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse. Sounds simple right, even boring? It isn't. Words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through; it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not.<br /><br />I could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction; maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky. I could point out that some of the sound effects are out-of-sync in a way to rival any Fulci movie, but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance.<br /><br />As far as extreme movies go, I've seen the hardest of them, and yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed, despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that I would consider ""gratuitous"". In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last tale. I won't ruin it, just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise, if not yearn for his end. <br /><br />Sure, it's not the best movie ever made, and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish, but in spite of these flaws Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema. If you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or ""nice"" movies, or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless, this is not what you're looking for. <br /><br />Whether you enjoy it or not, It's one you won't forget in a hurry.",1,whats the best way to start a review of a movie like der todesking  let me start by saying ive just come direct from viewing this movie  and the images are still burned deep into my brain   and i dont think theyll be moving any time soon  its probably fair to say that if youre on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you havent seen it  if not  let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate budget gem thats been lost for a few years a la  near dark   nor is it a low budget  schlocky   fun  b movie  what it is it low budget art  put forward in a simple yet poignant way  the idea is a simple one   seven stories revolving around  and ending in  suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse  sounds simple right  even boring  it isnt  words cant really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through  it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not  i could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction  maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super 8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky  i could point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync in a way to rival any fulci movie  but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance  as far as extreme movies go  ive seen the hardest of them  and yet der todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed  despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider  gratuitous   in fact  the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale  i wont ruin it  just to say that the characters emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise  if not yearn for his end   sure  its not the best movie ever made  and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish  but in spite of these flaws der todesking is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema  if youre someone who likes comfortable viewing or  nice  movies  or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless  this is not what youre looking for   whether you enjoy it or not  its one you wont forget in a hurry 
"The more I watch Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s. I don't really think it can be considered a film noir, but it is pretty dark at times, due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters.<br /><br />Typical performances from each of the three main actors, who all did a good job with their roles. I thought, however, that Hopper and Boyle's characters were left undeveloped, as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts to be very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to hand it to the director (i.e. when he first sees the sheriff). All in all, this movie is definitely worth watching. ***1/2",1,the more i watch nicholas cage  the more i appreciate him as an actor  watching this movie now  in 2005   i can see that it doesnt really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s  i dont really think it can be considered a film noir  but it is pretty dark at times  due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters  typical performances from each of the three main actors  who all did a good job with their roles  i thought  however  that hopper and boyles characters were left undeveloped  as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it  hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy  the plot is really good  and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic  there were parts where i had to hand it to the director  i e  when he first sees the sheriff   all in all  this movie is definitely worth watching     1 2

"Watching Smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minutes of my life. There wasn't a laugh to be had; in fact, I don't remember ever cracking a smile. Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder, the textbook overbearing mother character, a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic, and worst of all, boring.<br /><br />I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long string of movie clichés--the dippy, socially inept distant relative who's just trying to break into ""The Industry"", the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father, the mild- mannered wife who just can't take it anymore (but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home), the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away, etc.<br /><br />God, what a snore. I've never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why. Overacting is overacting, no matter how many pictures you did in your prime. Her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating. What was the director thinking?<br /><br />While I like Dax Shepard and can even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie.

The first one was different and funny. This attempt should have never left the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It is a weak attempt at gross out humor. The movie picks out current and old movies to rip-off. This time the jokes seem used and overdone.

"Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars.

I guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits (apart from the acting, plot, story, sets, dialogue and sound). I wrongly assumed it was about zombies. <br /><br />Watching it is actually quite scary in fairness; you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home-made amateur torture videos or something along those lines. <br /><br />I'm so taken aback I'm writing this review on my mobile so I don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered. <br /><br />I worst film I've ever seen and I can say (with hand on heart) it will never, never be topped.",0,someone actually gave this movie 2 stars  theres a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesnt spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary  this film is     well     i guess its pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn   snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits  apart from the acting  plot  story  sets  dialogue and sound   i wrongly assumed it was about zombies   watching it is actually quite scary in fairness  youre terrified someone will come over and youll never be able to describe what it is and theyll go away thinking youre a freak that watches home made amateur torture videos or something along those lines   im so taken aback im writing this review on my mobile so i dont forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1 6 to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered   i worst film ive ever seen and i can say  with hand on heart  it will never  never be topped 
"Yes it was a little low budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to ""Waterworld"" and though the plot was good, the film never really tapped into it's full potential! Strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night.",1,yes it was a little low budget  but this movie shows love  the only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to  waterworld  and though the plot was good  the film never really tapped into its full potential  strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night 
"Either or, I love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. I have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. A little too stylized for some but I fancy that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. I have often wondered at the paucity of Cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. I have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in ""Mask"". I found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called ""Cinderella"")but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. All in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot, I loved the ending, everyone brought together like a Greek Chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.",1,either or  i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie  i have re visited it many times and it always holds up  a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it  norman jewison  a fellow canadian  takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious  as this one is  i have often wondered at the paucity of chers acting roles  whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on  i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role  as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in  mask   i found the comedic strokes broad at times   a hair salon called  cinderella  but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director  nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera  all extravagant gestures  at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat  the brooklyn scenes are magical  this is a brooklyn under moonlight  romanticized and dramatic  just like opera  all in all a very satisfying film not to everyones taste by a long shot  i loved the ending  everyone brought together like a greek chorus  every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others  the camera pulling away down the hall  leaving the players talking  8 out of 10

"If you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of The Eden Formula. This wondrous film must have cost all of $50 to make. It features a wafer thin script, pathetically bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop motion, paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable (it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and/or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful). <br /><br />The actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter. The special effects are way beyond lousy. And the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes.<br /><br />This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath. <br /><br />I loved every minute of it.",0,if you want to watch a real quality movie get hold of the eden formula  this wondrous film must have cost all of  50 to make  it features a wafer thin script  pathetically bad sets  lighting and camera work  and a stop motion  paper mache monster that is utterly laughable  it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and or a glove puppet for the monster   but all were equally dreadful    the actors all speak their lines as though theyve never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter  the special effects are way beyond lousy  and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title tyranasaurus wrecks which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes  this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath   i loved every minute of it

"This movie is far better than the original The Jerk. I would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor. We have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from Monty Python.<br /><br />The card game with the hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans staged. While I like Steve Martin, he seemed like he was trying to hard.

"Honestly, I was disappointed in ""Expiration Date."" Super clever title and interesting premise, but I don't think it delivered. What was it about? The main character's desire to reconnect with his Native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But, he wasn't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear -- it seems as if his life was going fine, but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying. I didn't buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film didn't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story. They were all just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a ""curse"" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I did love the shots of Seattle, cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding.",0,honestly  i was disappointed in  expiration date   super clever title and interesting premise  but i dont think it delivered  what was it about  the main characters desire to reconnect with his native roots  or  more likely  it was his need to overcome his fear of death  but  he wasnt set up as someone who has lived his life in fear    it seems as if his life was going fine  but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying  i didnt buy it  meanwhile  the supporting characters in the film didnt seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story  they were all just doing their thing  running parallel to the main character  also  what was treated as a  curse  looked more like a coincidence  who cursed the family  why  when  finally  why didnt he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday  those are my criticisms  but i did love the shots of seattle  cinematography was beautiful  acting was good in the times it wasnt outstanding

"I just saw ""Valentine"" and I have to say that it was the best slasher movie that I've seen in years. Unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking. For those out there that hated ""Scream,"" there is not one reference to ""the horror rules"" in this movie (even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here). <br /><br />This is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror. You get the style, cinematography, and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick. I guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for.

"This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many, many times. The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment.

"Excellent movie, a realistic picture of contemporary Finland, touching and profound. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Captures marvelously the everyday life in a Central Finland small town, people's desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. The bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film Eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in Joki.",1,excellent movie  a realistic picture of contemporary finland  touching and profound  one of the best finnish films ever made  captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town  peoples desires and weaknesses  joys and sorrows  the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society  lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers  he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed  his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki

"When I heard the plot for this movie I simply had to see it, I mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes! Sadly the title is about as funny as it gets.<br /><br />Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn who never takes his SCUBA outfit off and Lt. Finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind) 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' is a parody of B-Movies, in particular Japanese horror of the 1950's. The film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses! To be fair there are a couple of funny moments, for instance anytime the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an American accent, or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes 'hey, can somebody please pass the ketchup?'. Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept. Unfortunately for 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' spoof films such as the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.<br /><br />The acting is atrocious; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy. For a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after the over. The singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre, even for this film. Ultimately, however, you can see why this film is a cult one; I can't see many people being indifferent to it.

"I have lost count of how many reviews I've written on Slaughter High. I've read a lot of bad ones and I will say right now this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide, and even though this was his only film, he is what made the movie so great. At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Then I found out due to the current webpage at www.IMDb.com he was born in 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses. He did a good acting job, who can disagree? I always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie. Must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least. I first saw this movie when I was 12 in the sixth grade. I agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered, and that high schools do NOT have bath tubs! I think Caroline Munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent, and unfortunately for Simon's death he made no future films. The reason(s) for his suicide are a mystery, and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. Doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this film two thumbs up, the best horror film made. Probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business. -Jacob Young",1,i have lost count of how many reviews ive written on slaughter high  ive read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie  simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide  and even though this was his only film  he is what made the movie so great  at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide  then i found out due to the current webpage at www imdb com he was born in 1957  in dayton  ohio  simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man  but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses  he did a good acting job  who can disagree  i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie  must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least  i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade  i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered  and that high schools do not have bath tubs  i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent  and unfortunately for simons death he made no future films  the reason s  for his suicide are a mystery  and hopefully will be discovered in the near future  doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high  he looked like a teenager  i give this film two thumbs up  the best horror film made  probably because of their horrible acting the others didnt make fame in the movie business   jacob young

For an example of a good summary, read the listing at ""Turner Classic Movies"". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a young child. My sister and I couldn't wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse movies of it's time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The romance is clean and endearing. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. They don't make movies like this anymore. Good acting and not over the top.

"First off, I'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the Best Picture Academy Award was 'Gigi' in 1958. That is misinformation as 'West Side Story' won in 1962, 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music' won the year after that. That said, this film is absolutely fantastic! The story from the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version. However, I don't mind. In fact, I rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does. I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh. I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office. The underscore for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any film version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is worked out much better than he is in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest, most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy.' I always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs. It looks awful and cheesy, especially when they're dancing at the London Meat Co. They should've just done regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.",1,first off  id like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was gigi in 1958  that is misinformation as west side story won in 1962  my fair lady won in 1965 and sound of music won the year after that  that said  this film is absolutely fantastic  the story from the novel has been somewhat altered  but thats more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didnt change back for a filmed version  however  i dont mind  in fact  i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does  i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment  the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh  i love the moment mr  bumble and mrs  bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office  the underscore for that moment is brilliant  my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild  who plays the best dodger in any film version of the story  ron moody  a playful and humorous fagin  this character is worked out much better than he is in the book   and shani wallis  who is the strongest  most distressed version of nancy  the only reason im giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are concider yourself and who will buy  i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs  it looks awful and cheesy  especially when theyre dancing at the london meat co  they shouldve just done regular choreography for these scenes  however  this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us  hopefully  forever 
"I hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time. The garbage that Hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall! This one was definetely fresh and witty. If you look at the demographic figures for the ratings, only a few women have voted! I don't want to ruin the movie for you but I'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score, why? Because the movie puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men...it could easily be a ""7"" rated movie!",1,i hadnt laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time  the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall  this one was definetely fresh and witty  if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings  only a few women have voted  i dont want to ruin the movie for you but im sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score  why  because the movie puts men in their place  thats why  if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men   it could easily be a  7  rated movie 
"""Zabriskie Point"" (1970): This was especially interesting to me on a personal level, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life  the Counter Culture movement of the late 60's/early 70's, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, who are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus, and, the other, a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father & employer, and take on an ""establishment"" job. The film is FULL of our Italian director's (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notations of America, and, the confused, psychedelicrazies of that era's self-righteous, ""we know it all, we'll change everything for the better"" youth. Just who IS the ""revolutionary""? What does that REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and march around chanting? Do you ""fly in under the radar"" but give advance notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plans to yourself, and go about the business of change, with no need for group approval? ""Zabriskie Point"" is definitely a ""period piece"" - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal film moments (after all, this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing ""Blow Up"" of 1966), and the era's artifacts, but it is more. It presents options for cultural revolution, and going by Antonioni (who DOES seem to be supportive of it), the youth are too self-involved to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone, any time, any place.",1, zabriskie point   1970   this was especially interesting to me on a personal level  since it takes place under identical circumstances  with identical peers  in my own life  the counter culture movement of the late 60s early 70s  on and off campus  we follow two unrelated young people in separate stories  who are slowly woven together  one is a young man in los angeles  tired of all the endless  pseudo revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus  and  the other  a young woman driving to phoenix to see her father   employer  and take on an  establishment  job  the film is full of our italian directors  michelangelo antonioni  visual notations of america  and  the confused  psychedelicrazies of that eras self righteous   we know it all  well change everything for the better  youth  just who is the  revolutionary   what does that really mean  do you dress like one and march around chanting  do you  fly in under the radar  but give advance notice of your arrival  do you keep your plans to yourself  and go about the business of change  with no need for group approval   zabriskie point  is definitely a  period piece    full of slang  uniforms  somewhat surreal film moments  after all  this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing  blow up  of 1966   and the eras artifacts  but it is more  it presents options for cultural revolution  and going by antonioni  who does seem to be supportive of it   the youth are too self involved to see what is needed for radical success  because of this  it becomes a powerful  frightening film that applies to anyone  any time  any place 
"The horse is indeed a fine animal. Picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick.<br /><br />The animation is simply stupendous.

"No,<br /><br />Basically your watching something that doesn't make sense. To not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick I will explain the story.<br /><br />A normal everyday to day women, is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car. She follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family.<br /><br />I specifically made an account to comment on this film, of how horribly written this was. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this, usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking, What just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing.<br /><br />Spoiler Starts__<br /><br />They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. It was not elaborated on all during the film, and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened. Nothing gets explained during the film. The main character shouldn't of even been the main character. At the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away (her sisters boyfriend) should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after. <br /><br />I bought this movie for $10, threw it out right after.. don't waste your time.

"This film is shockingly underrated on IMDb. Like so many films, this isn't Shawshank. But it's a reasonably good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer, than I think you'll like it.<br /><br />Judging from the IMDb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250, and was ""vote bombed"" with many 1s, as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob, don't have special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters.<br /><br />It's an American film, but it's not a US film. Set mostly in Toronto the cues are subtle, and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit.<br /><br />I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not convinced it's worth $50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes.<br /><br />I do agree the title sucks. I don't remember anyone in the film saying those words, and it should have an ""s"". (No, it's not a foreign language).<br /><br />There's not a lot to hate about this film (and let's be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it, and that's sad.",1,this film is shockingly underrated on imdb  like so many films  this isnt shawshank  but its a reasonably good  if predictable  dance competition   personal growth film  if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer  than i think youll like it  judging from the imdb ratings  my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250  and was  vote bombed  with many 1s  as happens to so many films that arent about the mob  dont have special effects  or include non white or non straight characters  its an american film  but its not a us film  set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle  and some audiences may think its set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit  i liked the music  i liked the dance  but not convinced its worth  50 000     but what do i know   the characters were easy on the eyes  i do agree the title sucks  i dont remember anyone in the film saying those words  and it should have an  s    no  its not a foreign language   theres not a lot to hate about this film  and lets be honest  a vote of 1 means you hated it  so i can only assume that its an expression of hate for the kind of people in it  and thats sad 
"This movie is an awesome non-stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes , buffoonish supporting characters , made-up dolls for heroines , nasty villains , wisecracks , rocking soundtrack + choreography and a little dose of action . <br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen . The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the cop . Heroines are mere rouge-smothered props as usual . The conmen have no heroines . Paresh Rawal carries his villainous act in DAUD forward (He played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT too) . Asrani shines in a brief role . He does a retake on his famous ""Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer"" act in SHOLAY .<br /><br />Govinda is impeccable as usual - as a wisecracking , good-humoured policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a conman Chhote Miyaan . He imitates Bihari style of Hindi speaking with hilarious results . Amitabh Bachchan , believe it or not , pales in comparison with him . But still AB is fine . Madhuri Dixit does a cameo as herself in the song ""Makhna"" . She dances like wind . <br /><br />Viju Shah's music is awesome . Check out ""Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen"" , ""Makhna"" and the title track .<br /><br />Do not go looking for any LOGIC since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely .

Racing vans, the total ass-wipe with the baddest van, the water bed, the smoking of herbs, the hot 70's chicks, the 'makin love in my Chevy van song, it was all so new to me.

"This isn't art, it's inner-urban, politically-correct propaganda! Jindabyne's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable... it doesn't see people as individuals, but rather, as members of categories.<br /><br />This is the most patronisingly offensive Australian movie I can recall ever (and it's up against some pretty stiff competition!). A message movie, every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there: Aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholics; white women aren't that bad -particularly if they are lesbians - but they're most likely of a depressive nature.<br /><br />Four men who go away fishing, find the body of a murdered woman (Aboriginal, naturally) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout. It's a strange decision taken with almost no discussion, as if the men are animals. The one man who briefly demurs is the goodie... we know this because he's living with a bisexual woman - he likes to hold his baby a lot - and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location (away from all these beastly bush-dwellers).<br /><br />This is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within. It's ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt. The film is shot through with long-distance views of the bush backed by foreboding, mysterious music. It's made very clear by the end that Aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape. It concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black-white reconciliation.<br /><br />In Jindabyne, country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other Australians.<br /><br />This film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the Government's Film Finance Corporation. It's a product of the artsy set, that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects (which are as detached from real life as possible), as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see. It doesn't matter if the film is a stinker, they still get paid.<br /><br />Spare yourself from wasting time, avoid it like the plague.

"The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. Basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters just ""showing up"" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I might add)? All in all it wasn't ""bad"". I rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.",0,the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story  but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable  basic elements such as character development were glossed over  at best  inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads  a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside  characters just  showing up  in the gardens during a stormy night  at very convenient times  i might add   all in all it wasnt  bad   i rated it a 4  based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott 
"Excellent film. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV), and it is plain to see that they were used in big train, not in the local railway - according to the story Chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations.

"Young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately he can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce. Then, one day, she's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods. Her horse gallops off with her clothes...and she runs after it! She meets young and very handsome Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes this is the man she wants.<br /><br />ENDING SPOILER!!!! Naturally, since this was made in 1933, she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale. END OF ENDING SPOILER!!!!<br /><br />This horrified people in 1933 but it's pretty tame by today's standards. Lamarr's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude, it's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such. There's only a few minor shots of her breasts. Also when she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm. These scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the American release. Now today they're back in. This film would get by with a PG-13 easily now.<br /><br />Shock episodes aside this is just OK. It is beautifully filmed and there's next to no dialogue. Except for the music score this could be a silent picture. Luckily all the actors are good--Lamarr and Mog especially and they're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them. Also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes with the sexual symbolism (there's quite a few of them) are unfortunately pretty obvious today. I actually started to giggle during one!<br /><br />So, great direction, beautiful imagery, attractive actors, good acting all around--but I wasn't exactly bowled over by it. I found the movie slow-moving (beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me), somewhat dull, obvious, static and had a negative ending. I can live with the ending but it doesn't excuse the other problems I had with it. Also the final sequence is REALLY strange--and out of place. So I admire this film more than anything else. It was well-done and I'd recommend it but with caution. Many people seem to love this movie so I'm in the minority.

"Sidney Franklin's ""The Good Earth"" has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting, especially from Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of O-Lan. Rainers performance is so complete, she is nearly unrecognizable. Having very little dialogue throughout the entire film (and it is a long one), Rainer relies instead on facial and body language. She looks and acts Chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such.<br /><br />The film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it. When Lung and wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning.

"The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. Thankfully, highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (rated lower than Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, don't let the cover of this movie decieve you. Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using such high-tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji is able to aid FBI agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the movie, including brief cameos by Denise Richards, a gay negro, and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl, Koji carries this movie on his own. Any fan of movies such as The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.",0,the volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters  thankfully  highly acclaimed director nelson mccormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time  rated lower than side out and higher than  well  umm   however  dont let the cover of this movie decieve you  kill shot stars up and coming star koji as a modern day sherlock holmes  using such high tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my gameboy  koji is able to aid fbi agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime  while there are other actors in the movie  including brief cameos by denise richards  a gay negro  and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl  koji carries this movie on his own  any fan of movies such as the matrix or hackers will definitely love kill shot 
"this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga. the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for. there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection, 'comics underground japan', and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here. i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this, as it explains some of the ""plot"" of the movie, which is otherwise inexplicable. animation wise this is pretty decent, good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well. it jumps in and out of episodes, as the characters, a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images: a boat, a circus, a desert. for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plots and settings, which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long-running manga to adapt at random, but primarilly selected visually. knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation. this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show, cartoon sushi, in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt-cheek around the house. only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [though not all that easy to tell what's going on]. the dvd of this has director's commentary and a ""making of"" features, but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them. i'm giving this a 8/10 for now, here isnt much to compare it to in anime, and i hope for more like this.",1,this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue  what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga  the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for  there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection  comics underground japan  and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here  i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this  as it explains some of the  plot  of the movie  which is otherwise inexplicable  animation wise this is pretty decent  good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well  it jumps in and out of episodes  as the characters  a cat and his brain dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images  a boat  a circus  a desert  for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi plots and settings  which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long running manga to adapt at random  but primarilly selected visually  knowing whats going on might somewhat increase appreciation  this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show  cartoon sushi  in particular a short that features a cat chasing a mans severed butt cheek around the house  only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes  though not all that easy to tell whats going on   the dvd of this has directors commentary and a  making of  features  but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them  im giving this a 8 10 for now  here isnt much to compare it to in anime  and i hope for more like this 
"The acting wasn't great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Dongen",0,the acting wasnt great  the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters  its about the repercussions of the struggle between right wing flemish block voters on the one side and the moroccon people living in the belgian city antwerp on the other side  is it a political analysis   is it some kind of belgian west side story or modern romeo and juliet   the film just isnt strong enough to answer both questions  supposing those were the directors questions  too   still  some of the scenes could function as a kind of ken loach film  set in antwerp  after all  this city has been the starting point of the extremist right wing flemish block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures  its very difficult to make a film about this situation  and this one isnt successful  unfortunately  still  its telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present day belgium  the few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise its not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt belgium  a 10 million people country  in the 2000s dries van dongen
"This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either. But some observations:<br /><br />1. If the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it is only a matter of lousy film-making, not giving a damn about being coherent.<br /><br />2. We don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully (=bombastically) delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in.<br /><br />3. Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly humiliating his actors.<br /><br />4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary-schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondary-school level of skill. If that was the point, the point sucked.",0,this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in tsai ming liang for me  it oozes laziness from its every frame  so im not going to analyse it thoroughly either  but some observations  1  if the premise is drought  why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees  i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film  in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy  and watermelon the trivial substitute  sex   or it is only a matter of lousy film making  not giving a damn about being coherent  2  we dont get to know what had happened to the porn actress  why she is unconscious or  presumably  dead  it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully   bombastically  delivered  but in retrospect  her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick  a pretext  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in  3  nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadnt expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly humiliating his actors  4  the musical numbers  recycled from the hole  felt like a secondary schoolers idea of artistic counterpointing  executed on that very secondary school level of skill  if that was the point  the point sucked 
"This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",0,this film was probably inspired by godards masculin  féminin and i urge you to see that film instead  the film has two strong elements and those are   1  the realistic acting  2  the impressive  undeservedly good  photo  apart from that  what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness  lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world  she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film    its unattractive  comparing to godards film  intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity  without going too far on this subject  i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society  a movie of its time  and place  2 10

"Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie. I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven's Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls. My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree. I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man.

"""In the world of old-school kung fu movies, where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen, it took a lot for a film to stand out -- and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years. What is arguably Chang Cheh's finest movie continues to hold influence over the Hong Kong movie industry, from the themes of loyalty, brotherhood and revenge as explored by John Woo (who got his start in the HK movie industry working for Chang) during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's, to more modern movies like A Man Called Hero, which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film. The influence has also carried into other areas as well, from music such as the Wu-Tang Clan, TV commercials for Sprite and video games such as ""Mortal Kombat."" So what makes this movie so special? The plot -- on the surface -- is pretty simple. It deals with members of a rogue group known as the ""Poison Clan"" who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu. All of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities, denoted by their animal styles, or ""venoms"" (the lizard can climb walls, the scorpion has a deadly strike, etc.). The twist is that since the clan always wears masks, not all of them known who the others are. Thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller. We're not talking The Usual Suspects here, but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time. Supposedly, Golden Harvest was not too happy with Chang's script -- like most of his movies, they felt it was too dark and violent -- and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it. Thankfully, Chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script, which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time, if not ever, completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences.<br /><br />But what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves. Chang Cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast -- not only did he gain talented martial artists (whose moves, competed without the aid of wires or other special effects, put most modern martial artists to shame) but great actors as well. The formula proved so popular that Chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies. Getting back to matters at hand, in most old-school movies, the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts, but here the actors actually create characters. It seems that everyone has a favorite venom (mine is Philip Kwok -- best known to many as Mad Dog from Hard-Boiled -- as Lizard) and it is this personal connection to the characters that The Five Deadly Venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre. Even if you're normally not a fan of old-school movies, you need to check The Five Deadly Venoms out, if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from.""",1, in the world of old school kung fu movies  where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen  it took a lot for a film to stand out    and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years  what is arguably chang chehs finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry  from the themes of loyalty  brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo  who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang  during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980s  to more modern movies like a man called hero  which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film  the influence has also carried into other areas as well  from music such as the wu tang clan  tv commercials for sprite and video games such as  mortal kombat   so what makes this movie so special  the plot    on the surface    is pretty simple  it deals with members of a rogue group known as the  poison clan  who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu  all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities  denoted by their animal styles  or  venoms   the lizard can climb walls  the scorpion has a deadly strike  etc    the twist is that since the clan always wears masks  not all of them known who the others are  thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller  were not talking the usual suspects here  but its far above many other kung fu movies of the time  supposedly  golden harvest was not too happy with changs script    like most of his movies  they felt it was too dark and violent    and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it  thankfully  chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script  which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time  if not ever  completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences  but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves  chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast    not only did he gain talented martial artists  whose moves  competed without the aid of wires or other special effects  put most modern martial artists to shame  but great actors as well  the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies  getting back to matters at hand  in most old school movies  the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts  but here the actors actually create characters  it seems that everyone has a favorite venom  mine is philip kwok    best known to many as mad dog from hard boiled    as lizard  and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre  even if youre normally not a fan of old school movies  you need to check the five deadly venoms out  if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from  
"Fate/Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h-game. Somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff. It couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection.(You'll understand once you see all the episodes).<br /><br />Despite a relatively slow start (the producer took his time on presenting the characters) things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid-series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat.<br /><br />The topic of the series concentrates on the War of Holy Grail that has been taking place in the Fukuky City for the last 50 years. The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city.He unwillingly witnesses a fight between two Servants that triggers his Reiju (Holy mark) to summon one of the most powerful Servants of the battlefield, Saber. His first contact with Saber left him stunned ""Such immeasurable beauty ...I was at a lost for words"". <br /><br />You mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot. FSN offers much more than some cool sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, it offers excellent character and relationship development. It presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate. The action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals (not similar to the linear type other series use) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal, from under the mask of perfection, flawed characters.<br /><br />The Saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such. You shouldn't watch FSN thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact, just remember that this is adventure/fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes I would have watched them in the same breath.",1,fate stay night is an animated series inspired by a h game  somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h stuff  it couldnt have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way its pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection  youll understand once you see all the episodes   despite a relatively slow start  the producer took his time on presenting the characters  things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat  the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years  the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on  shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju  holy mark  to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield  saber  his first contact with saber left him stunned  such immeasurable beauty    i was at a lost for words    you mustnt compare this series with any other to fully understand its plot  fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights  good animation  spectacular lights  great soundtrack  it offers excellent character and relationship development  it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate  the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals  not similar to the linear type other series use  that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal  from under the mask of perfection  flawed characters  the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such  you shouldnt watch fsn thinking that it doesnt present the viewer with the historic fact  just remember that this is adventure fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can  the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath 
"I saw this movie about a year ago, and found it to be completely Laugh-Out-Loud funny. A real winner, in my mind. It had the underlining of a stupid comedy, but indeed had an actual plot as well. Much like the hit comedy, Elf, in fact. It had a few serious moments, sandwiched between hilarity. When Stiller shot Black's horse, an ordinarily sober moment, you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics. You can actually find common ground there, as I'm sure many people have done something they wouldn't want a friend to find out about, lest your friendship should end.<br /><br />When I found out how much people disliked this movie, I was completely dumbfounded. That absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you don't find yourself laughing at least once, I'll compensate you the rental fee. =D",1,i saw this movie about a year ago  and found it to be completely laugh out loud funny  a real winner  in my mind  it had the underlining of a stupid comedy  but indeed had an actual plot as well  much like the hit comedy  elf  in fact  it had a few serious moments  sandwiched between hilarity  when stiller shot blacks horse  an ordinarily sober moment  you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics  you can actually find common ground there  as im sure many people have done something they wouldnt want a friend to find out about  lest your friendship should end  when i found out how much people disliked this movie  i was completely dumbfounded  that absolutely terrible movies like napoleon dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on imdb  take my advice and rent it  if you dont find yourself laughing at least once  ill compensate you the rental fee   d
"This film deserves another bad review. Consider one reviewer extolling the film's virtues that include 'no sex, violence or gore.' Uh, excuse me. The very set-up of the film has us watching as Cody's young comrade, with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving Cody holding his lifeless, bloody body. And, given the nature of war we know that Cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis. So much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines Cody's persona is erased from viewer memory.<br /><br />Sans any family of his own Cody, like John Rambo, roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown USA in the guise of some place called Nevada City. No mention, no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged goods. We know this since his CO practically declares him so as he order Cody to 'get some rest' away from the death and destruction of war. This explains, as none seem to notice or care, Cody's obvious 'flat' effect. It is not bad acting. It is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder. Not guessing here, remember his CO ordered him off the battle field.<br /><br />How about that 'accidental' kiss as noted by another review. The fall was an accident, the kiss was not. How exactly was Cody 'respecting' Faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for? Now that was a non-family value moment. A moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on YouTube. Of course faith's lapse of fidelity as well as Cody's 'coming on' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the Xmas season, all CHEERING their cheaten' hearts and lips.<br /><br />We know little about Faith's fiancé except that she professes her love for him, she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal (could have waited if any second thoughts), he is generous, he loves her to death, the family has nothing really against him, he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans. No evil doers here.<br /><br />Asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son....' 'You are part of our family' literally days after they have met a stranger named Cody. And the 'band of brothers' speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field.<br /><br />Bottom line: This film is cotton candy Xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways. Most grossly when it applauds Cody's disrespect for Faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for. By re-defining family as we know it to wit: accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all 'love you.'

"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he didn't get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.",0,i am a big 1930s movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me  so i gave this a shot  after all its the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian  i have watched much less of lloyds silent films then of chaplins but i have to say im a much bigger chaplin fan  anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didnt finish it  i can understand why his sound career was so limited  he didnt get very good material to work with  after youve seen chaplin  abbott and costello  the three stooges  martin and lewis  the marx brothers  and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs  or violence in general   this one is very forgettable  i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me  maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film  at least it seemed that way  is before he gets in a ring  i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time  4 out of 10  dont watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again  very flat  for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend  kelly the second  made a few years earlier  another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase  these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel 
Just don't bother. I thought I would see a movie with great supspense and action.<br /><br />But it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end the it gets better but not really great. I think the director took this movie just too serious. In such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action. I nearly dozed off in the middle/main part of it. Rating 3/10.<br /><br />derboiler.,0,just dont bother  i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and action  but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start  in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed  towards the end the it gets better but not really great  i think the director took this movie just too serious  in such a kind of a movie even if u dont care about the plot at least you want some nice action  i nearly dozed off in the middle main part of it  rating 3 10  derboiler 
"This is surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. All the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. I bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus I loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy. The finale was really cool, as I loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well, plus all the characters except for Ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable!. It's decently made and written, and I thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer didn't mess around, and I loved it, and Slasher fans(like myself) should really enjoy this film, plus The opening was really wicked too, with them filming the movie!. This is a surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and I say it's well worth the watch!. The Direction is good. Kimble Rendall does a good! job here with solid camera work, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. The acting is solid!. Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and I had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, I'm surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!. Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, creepy and had one hell of a mask, and this guy didn't mess around, he was fantastic!. Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5",1,this is surprisingly above average slasher  thats enjoyable and well made  with some decent gore   all the characters are decent  and the story is quite fun  plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well  i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1   and it was surprisingly worth it  and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget  plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy  the finale was really cool  as i loved how they defeated the killer  and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well  plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable   its decently made and written  and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well  plus some of the death scenes were very impressive  this killer didnt mess around  and i loved it  and slasher fans like myself  should really enjoy this film  plus the opening was really wicked too  with them filming the movie   this is a surprisingly above average slasher  thats enjoyable and well made  with some decent gore  and i say its well worth the watch   the direction is good  kimble rendall does a good  job here with solid camera work  using a creepy setting  good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace  the acting is solid   molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well and i had troubles feeling sorry for her  after all she was supposed to be the heroine  she turned out better towards the end  but not by much  im surprised she decided to do this film  nonetheless she did an excellent job   frank roberts is fantastic as the killer  he is menacing  creepy and had one hell of a mask  and this guy didnt mess around  he was fantastic   kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role  jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine  rest of the cast are fine  overall well worth the watch       out of 5
"I felt duty bound to watch the 1983 Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of ""Jane Eyre,"" because I'd just written an article about the 2006 BBC ""Jane Eyre"" for TheScreamOnline.<br /><br />So, I approached watching this the way I'd approach doing homework.<br /><br />I was irritated at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters.<br /><br />And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school play.<br /><br />And the pancake make-up is way too heavy.<br /><br />And the sets don't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel. They are too fussy, too Martha Stewart. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in cave-like gloom, very appropriate to the novel's Gothic mood.<br /><br />And yet ... with all those objections ... not only is this the best ""Jane Eyre"" I've seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen.<br /><br />This ""Jane Eyre,"" in spite of its technical flaws, brought the feeling back to me of reading ""Jane Eyre"" for the first time.<br /><br />The critics of this production say it is too close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and didn't need it to be any less ""wordy"" or any less ""Christian"" or any more sexed up, this version's faithfulness to the novel Bronte actually wrote is its finest asset.<br /><br />Bronte wrote a darn good book. There's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus, while other, slicker, sexier and easier texts, have disappeared.<br /><br />As a long time ""Jane Eyre"" fan, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is, famously, not handsome; Jane and Rochester are literature's famous ugly couple. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome.<br /><br />But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester. He just blew me away. I've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue, and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings the page's Rochester to quivering life on screen.<br /><br />Rochester is meant to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles got the scary streak down, too, for example, when he shouts ""Enough!"" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary more than once, here. You really can't tell if he's going to hurt Jane, or himself, in his desperation.<br /><br />Rochester's imperiousness, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: Dalton conveys all, sometimes seconds apart. It's stunning.<br /><br />And here's the key thing -- the actor performing Rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret.<br /><br />No other actor I've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current fan favorite Toby Stephens doesn't even try. Dalton hits it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a singles bar, i would say, ""That guy is trouble. Don't even look at him."" He's that radioactive with tamped down agony.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke is not only, overall, the best Jane I've seen, she's one of the very few Janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts Jane. No, folks who know ""Jane Eyre"" only from the 2006 version, Bronte did *not* describe a statuesque, robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips. Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, indeed, poor, plain, obscure, and little, and NOT pretty.<br /><br />Zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes, and a bit of a nose. She's truly ""little."" She is no fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the truest to the book.<br /><br />Some described her a cold or boring. No, she's true to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mama, she's a sheltered, deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments, as Zelah's do here. The book's Jane is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to truly plumb her depths. You have to watch Zelah, here, to get to know who she really is.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more fire in Zelah in one key scene, but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is, otherwise, very good.<br /><br />In spite of its closeness to the text, this version, like every other version I've seen, shys away from fully explicating the overtly Christian themes in ""Jane Eyre."" Christianity is not incidental subtext in ""Jane Eyre,"" it is central.<br /><br />Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter cultural way to read, and live, her apparently doomed, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces poor, plain, obscure Jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. That isn't made fully clear here.<br /><br />In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of it, of all the ones I've seen, mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation I've seen, and that says a lot.<br /><br />Other versions, that don't fully honor the book, end up being a chore to watch in many places. If you don't care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester.<br /><br />This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote -- about Jane's experiences at Lowood, and her relationship to St. John -- are part of what makes Jane's relationship to Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.",1,i felt duty bound to watch the 1983 timothy dalton   zelah clarke

"I found this film embarrassing to watch. I felt like it was shoving the storyline down my throat as if I couldn't pick up the subtleties I needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly.<br /><br />Having a father who IS still an alcoholic, I didn't really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion of course. They find it hard to communicate, something that the main character had no problem with really, except he DID have a problem saying I love you at one point- which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character. He was constantly surrounded with people too!? <br /><br />I felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil. I couldn't connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father. I felt nothing at all when it had finished, just relief it was over.<br /><br />Kevin McKidd is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead! The clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teen, they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult McKidd.<br /><br />On a good note, I felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film!!",0,i found this film embarrassing to watch  i felt like it was shoving the storyline down my throat as if i couldnt pick up the subtleties i needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly  having a father who is still an alcoholic  i didnt really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such  alcoholics  true alcoholics are very lonely people inside  in my opinion of course  they find it hard to communicate  something that the main character had no problem with really  except he did have a problem saying i love you at one point  which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character  he was constantly surrounded with people too    i felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil  i couldnt connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father  i felt nothing at all when it had finished  just relief it was over  kevin mckidd is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead  the clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick  mckidd was too old for the teen  they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult mckidd  on a good note  i felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film  
"Everything about this film is hog wash. Pitiful acting, awful dialog, ugly native girls. this movie sinks into oblivion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend bender. Robert C. is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on . The college kids are worst. No acting talent at all, very stupid reasoning, and just down right dumbbells. Special effects are for the birds. The so called security force around this park belongs in toy land: with stupid looking guns, walkie talkies that are useless; and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete. the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew.

"I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded interesting at times. However, the obvious nonsense of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some loony named ""Ramtha"" completely upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What a waste of two hours.",0,i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie  but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i recalled from the excellent  short history of nearly everything  and what i was able to choke down in  a brief history of time   it sounded interesting at times  however  the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous  i really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point  but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually  channelling  some loony named  ramtha  completely upset the applecart for me  what a waste of two hours 
"This movie was a stupid piece of crap. Bad everything. Why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns. It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner, or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it isn't worth messing with. For the most part the main action of Shiloh Falls was taking place in 1892, yet the revolvers used were 1860s models. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene the Marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity. Perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.",0,this movie was a stupid piece of crap  bad everything  why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns  it seems that if you dont see names like robert duval  kevin kostner  or tom selleck attached to the cover  it isnt worth messing with  for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in 1892  yet the revolvers used were 1860s models  even the shooting was bad   in one scene the marshal fanned his six shooter about nine times and couldnt hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away  i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity  perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting

"This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government.<br /><br />Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples. He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A-List about him. The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti-hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti-hero. That is not very normal. Jean Peters gave a so-so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold. That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool-pigeon.<br /><br />The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk. There is a fight scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was pretty gritty and exciting.<br /><br />I think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this film. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone.",1,this is a pretty decent example of film noir  the setting is the early 50s with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us government  richard widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples  he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a list about him  the interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film  an unlikeable anti hero  that is not very normal  jean peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold  that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the stool pigeon  the plot had its fair share of twists and turns  wisecracks and tough talk  there is a fight scene near the end of the movie  in the subway station  that was pretty gritty and exciting  i think noir fans  like myself  will enjoy this film  for non noir viewers  it may seem a little dated and the whole commie thing a tad overdone

Micheal Keaton breezes through the role of Johnny, easily his best screen performance. Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, what a shame directors didn't pick up on this. And I have even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. I don't think it's an accident that the bulk of the character's name is spelled MORON.<br /><br />Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner given good lines.

"There are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence. One of those few is Judy Davis, who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart. She takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery, deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen.<br /><br />Her skills are well displayed in ""High Tide,"" a film that matches her up a second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis her first major success with ""My Brilliant Career."" In that film, Davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world, despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing. In ""High Tide,"" however, Davis' character, Lillie, is roughly the opposite: she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young, and, after giving birth to a child, runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning. When she finally meets up with her daughter years later, the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying; she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect?<br /><br />Gillian Armstrong's films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other, but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions. ""Oscar and Lucinda,"" for instance, was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance, represented by their gambling addictions. Here, we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it's too late to change for the better. This is not simply a film with a great performance at its center, but also a rare achievement: a fully convincing story of redemption.",1,there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence  one of those few is judy davis  who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart  she takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery  deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen  her skills are well displayed in  high tide   a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong  who gave davis her first major success with  my brilliant career   in that film  davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world  despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing  in  high tide   however  davis character  lillie  is roughly the opposite  she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young  and  after giving birth to a child  runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning  when she finally meets up with her daughter years later  the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying  she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures  but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect  gillian armstrongs films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other  but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions   oscar and lucinda   for instance  was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each others love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance  represented by their gambling addictions  here  we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mothers inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that its too late to change for the better  this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center  but also a rare achievement  a fully convincing story of redemption 
"This work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs.

"Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams. I was surprised that it didn't strike me as over-sentimental; this movie played fair. Dennis Quaid was very, very good in the role, which is saying something for a sports movie. I can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me; here, everybody looks the part. This movie is surprisingly good, and I predict that it will do surprising business as it is a G-rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert to the contrary, this movie is a success.",1,despite disneys best efforts  this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams  i was surprised that it didnt strike me as over sentimental  this movie played fair  dennis quaid was very  very good in the role  which is saying something for a sports movie  i cant recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me  here  everybody looks the part  this movie is surprisingly good  and i predict that it will do surprising business as it is a g rated movie that doesnt require the viewer to stop thinking  ebert to the contrary  this movie is a success 
"A man wakes from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents. They go on the tour, but leave the group to make out. She falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again, and seems to know a bat is approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. He fights it off her, and it attacks him, biting his forehead.<br /><br />They get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He becomes angry when this happens. He's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about rabies, and he starts a Pasteur treatment for that, but reacts violently to the injection.<br /><br />And then some people are killed. We see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person. It seems it is not just in his mind. Whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear, since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.<br /><br />While the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of the desert, cave, and ski-slope locations, and some of the weirder scenes. I didn't think this was as bad as other people do, and I didn't think the 1999 movie Bats was as bad as others think either (I rated that one a 5/10).",0,a man wakes from a nightmare about bats  he and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon  he seems to hear a strange noise  and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket  he wants to go on a tour of a cave  which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing  but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon  she relents  they go on the tour  but leave the group to make out  she falls down a slope  where she is disturbed by insects  he follows her  he hears the strange noise again  and seems to know a bat is approaching  one does  and gets in her hair  he fights it off her  and it attacks him  biting his forehead  they get out of the cave  but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort  he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people  he becomes angry when this happens  hes unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out  his wife worries about rabies  and he starts a pasteur treatment for that  but reacts violently to the injection  and then some people are killed  we see parts of the mans transformation into a bat person  it seems it is not just in his mind  whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear  since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite  while the title seems inappropriate  the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person  not a very good movie  but i liked the variety of the desert  cave  and ski slope locations  and some of the weirder scenes  i didnt think this was as bad as other people do  and i didnt think the 1999 movie bats was as bad as others think either  i rated that one a 5 10  
"This movie is funny and suitable for any age. It is definitely family-type entertainment. The cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid-western town of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the Interstate. The location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by Martians. But these Martians are totally inept, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons... including one set on eradicating the Martians, too! The Martians dead-pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them... leave earth. J. J. Anderson playing the very young Halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines. Watch this movie for laugher and entertainment; thought-provoking it isn't.

"If you only read a synopsis of the plot, this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930's. The story would seem quite contrived, the subject matter maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film is in the direct, earthy performances of the cast.I have seldom seen Jean Harlow display such a range of feeling, rich and subtle nuances float over her face. If you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters. The raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant: when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son, lifts him up and proudly says, ""My kid!"", I couldn't help remember that Mr. Gable's own son was born to him posthumously.

"Why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap? My god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it. I can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it. Also, there is apparently some controversy as to whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was uncredited but his list of roles here (IMDB) does give him credit. BTW... Rain is his sister for those who have were asking before. This film is proof that no matter how many big ""names"" you have. Sow's ears don't make silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco but this was just sad, sad, sad...

"I don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here. I only saw it when it came onto cable. The film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. Specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.<br /><br />Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was.<br /><br />I'm certainly happy it was'nt - Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. The scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.<br /><br />This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan's run or THX1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest I've seen to it in a long time.<br /><br />He changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack Arnie one liners, he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending.<br /><br />That's why this film did'nt do well.

"The full title of this film is 'May you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead', a rewording of the old Irish toast 'May you have food and raiment, a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven, before the devil knows you're dead.' First time screenwriter Kelly Masterson (with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes. In this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but, here, very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling. By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale, we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong. <br /><br />Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a wealthy executive, married to an emotionally needy Gina (Marisa Tomei), and addicted to an expensive drug habit. His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money. Andy's ne're-do well younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife Martha (Amy Ryan), is behind in alimony and child support, and has borrowed all he can from his friends, and he needs money. Andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small Mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe, quick cash for both. The glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - Charles (Albert Finney) and Nanette (Rosemary Harris). Andy advances Hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that Hank will do the actual robbery, but though Hank agrees to the 'fail-safe' plan, he hires a friend to take on the actual job while Hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car. The robbery is horribly botched when Nanette, filing in for the regular clerk, shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess. The disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when Nanette dies, Charles and Andy and Hank (and their respective partners) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn. <br /><br />Each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances, and while we have come to expect that from Hoffman, Hawke, Tomei, Finney, Ryan, and Harris, it is the wise hand of direction from Sidney Lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect, a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be.

"I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets ""visions"" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",0,i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie  i found it to be absolutely idiotic  the mother gets  visions  when she touches certain things or people  and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue    just seemed so ridiculous  deedee pfieffers performance was awful i thought  she was very irritating  the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with  i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me 
"Now, I know French inmates are unlikely to have read Lovecraft (and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school, maybe as a separate subject), but how did they think something that sounds like ""ftagn yog sototh"" could possibly lead to any good?<br /><br />The movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may, if read right, get them out. As prisons go, the cell was totally unrealistic, so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves rather slowly, which may bore people. But other than that, this is top notch horror feeling, mixing Sartre's ""hell is other people"" with a Lovecraft/Barker type of story, and doing rather successfully.<br /><br />Bottom line: take the time to watch this. That means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else. This is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it.

"Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan's dream come true. At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life. A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored. It seems like a winning situation. And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this ""esoteric dream"" is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence. While it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project. And it is only a very few times.<br /><br />You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics. But then we start seeing new footage (alternates from Superman - The Movie for the trial) and that first bit of hesitation fades away. Hey, this is pretty neat! Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project, and it doesn't convince at all. And from this point on, it never ever lets up. It's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects, but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was ""You'll Believe A Man Can Fly"" it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here. The best effects in this are from the original productions.<br /><br />Another issue with this re-cut. A lot of it just doesn't make sense. The only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense. Lester's Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly. Part of this could be because Donner didn't get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible. What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.<br /><br />After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester. The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II. That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner. But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is re-edited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing. While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.<br /><br />So is there anything good in this release? Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that's neat to see. In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman - The Movie. But that only highlights the problems of this release. Any of the major scenes (really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando) would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section. Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances (many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used) sloppy edits and bad decisions.<br /><br />Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet. Why are we looking at Jackie Cooper's back as he calls for Lois and Clark? At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on? I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois. The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.<br /><br />Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts. It's just random action. Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates. They should have used more of Lester's footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.<br /><br />The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well. As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation ""XK 10"" while we all know it's the ""XK 101""! A blind man in STM knows that! The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production. For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.<br /><br />The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states. As it is, we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a ""Play All"" option. It's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else. I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lester's version. It's by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief. He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new re-cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.",0,superman ii

"I collect Horror films from all over and I have seen the good and the very bad - Zombie Bloodbath is a low budget video. Sure, the acting is bad, the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots. The thing you seem to be missing is that it's still entertaining and really very fun. The effects range from, like someone on here has said, pasty-faced zombies that look like KISS rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work. But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area. The effects are very good for such a small film. Someone called it a Party movie and it is. 100% fun party movie. I have heard from various websites that this is actually a ""rough cut"" of the film that got general release but the actual ""director's cut"" is coming on DVD and it is very nice quality. I will buy it and judge for myself.<br /><br />Story is basically a Nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies. The gov't closes it down, hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it. Some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area. A few actors do a great job, there's some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true, good music, great lighting, some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore. One guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up, if you know what I mean. Then his guts are shoved out of his mouth. Another is torn in half like in Day Of The Dead and they did a great job of that effect. There are a million gore gags and it's almost ALL action. I say stop being a prude, enjoy life and get more movies like Zombie Bloodbath and Meat market. Two great undead epics.<br /><br />OK - UPDATE!!! I just got the DVD set and here is what I thought:<br /><br />MUCH better picture quality and for once I was able to see the actual DIRECTOR'S CUT of the film and it is a much better movie. I liked it before, but now I can see what Todd Sheets was actually trying to do with this one. And the commentary helps too, hearing Sheets talk about the film in detail, He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to all people involved. Also, Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well. I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN, FOX and MTV. Over all, a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. While newer DV films are technically superior, they just aren't this much fun!<br /><br />PS - I heard they are now remaking this on a big budget???",1,i collect horror films from all over and i have seen the good and the very bad   zombie bloodbath is a low budget video  sure  the acting is bad  the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots  the thing you seem to be missing is that its still entertaining and really very fun  the effects range from  like someone on here has said  pasty faced zombies that look like kiss rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work  but the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area  the effects are very good for such a small film  someone called it a party movie and it is  100  fun party movie  i have heard from various websites that this is actually a  rough cut  of the film that got general release but the actual  directors cut  is coming on dvd and it is very nice quality  i will buy it and judge for myself  story is basically a nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies  the govt closes it down  hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it  some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area  a few actors do a great job  theres some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true  good music  great lighting  some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore  one guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up  if you know what i mean  then his guts are shoved out of his mouth  another is torn in half like in day of the dead and they did a great job of that effect  there are a million gore gags and its almost all action  i say stop being a prude  enjoy life and get more movies like zombie bloodbath and meat market  two great undead epics  ok   update    i just got the dvd set and here is what i thought  much better picture quality and for once i was able to see the actual directors cut of the film and it is a much better movie  i liked it before  but now i can see what todd sheets was actually trying to do with this one  and the commentary helps too  hearing sheets talk about the film in detail  he knows its a trashy zombie movie  but he does show respect to all people involved  also  sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field  the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well  i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for  there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage  mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn  fox and mtv  over all  a fun little film that is very rough around the edges  but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride  i have seen many dv films  and some shot of video films  and many are quite dull  but this one really wasnt  while newer dv films are technically superior  they just arent this much fun  ps   i heard they are now remaking this on a big budget   
"Okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a $60,000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed? Plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her ""proof"". I don't know I was not happy with the ending. This movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy.",0,okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a  60 000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed  plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldnt you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her  and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her  proof   i dont know i was not happy with the ending  this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad  do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy 
"This movie is a must-see movie for all. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier, as should everyone in America. The previous reviewer totally missed the point--the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who just live in our ""enemy's"" territory, and what it does to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY, before another person is killed or injured. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are injured mentally, with ptsd- post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. Julie A.

"I did not read anything about the film before I watched it, by chance, last Saturday evening. And then, as I was watching it, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman into my bones. I was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that I listened only partially to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and I was sleepless, under the impact of the film. I wanted to wake him up just to say:""if I would ever vote for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors."" I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the film on IMDb, and was sad to learn that Mr. Berry died before the release of the film and that he had probably never seen the last version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that to me his film was a true independent film, in its concept and spirit. The actors are to be praised not only for their brilliant performance but for accepting a part with no shine, no showing off, well to the contrary, displaying the true image of human depression.

"I signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is. Besides being a rip-off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid, cliché-ridden script to work with. It's bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself groaning over and over again, you have to conclude that the director also isn't the brightest bulb in the movie business, nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The mostly low-rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment, because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure, not that being a part of this joke-of-a-movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition. It may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case, for, to do so, would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand. Just as studying well-made movies can inspire you how to make a good, skillfully put-together work of art and beauty, the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work!

"This movie makes me want to throw up every time I see it. If you take the first movie, and reverse the plot (ariel wants to leave the sea, her daughter wants to go to the sea), take the same characters and give them new animals and new names, and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor, possible, you get the little mermaid 2. Its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot. I'll take you through the horror of it step by step. These are the people from the 1st movie: First of all, Prince Eric is still prince eric, with about 3 lines in the whole movie. Ariel is uptight, annoying, and is not the carefree, headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st. In fact, she is the exact opposite. Sebastian is still sebastian only less cute, less convincing as being stressed out, and the jokes just aren't funny anymore. Flounder has about 2 lines. He now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice. Scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny. King Triton's character is probably the best, he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter, Melody. Ariel and Prince Eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter. <br /><br />Like i said, all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them. This is what they did: Ursula- The new evil villain is Morgana, Ursula's sister who feels like she always lived in Ursula's shadow. I wouldn't be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife. She can't do anything right and she's a failure as a villain. She has the same voice ursula did. Sebastian & Flounder - Have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks, Tip & Dash, a walrus and a penguin. They try to be hero's but always fail when trying. the plot is so predictable. They become heroes at the end. Yawn. Flatson& Jetsom- Now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton. Hes really bad too. Morgana and the shark (sharkbait, I think was his name) have no chemistry, good or bad. Ariel-Ah, Ariel. Our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un-lovely daughter, melody. Melody cannot sing, her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be, and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet. She wants to go to the sea, she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her, she has to go find herself. yawn.<br /><br />Not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is. Certain parts of the movie make you want to call Disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original.<br /><br />Basically, comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and Ed Wood movie to Casablanca. Don't ever watch this, not even when your bored.",0,this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it  if you take the first movie  and reverse the plot  ariel wants to leave the sea  her daughter wants to go to the sea   take the same characters and give them new animals and new names  and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor  possible  you get the little mermaid 2  its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot  ill take you through the horror of it step by step  these are the people from the 1st movie  first of all  prince eric is still prince eric  with about 3 lines in the whole movie  ariel is uptight  annoying  and is not the carefree  headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st  in fact  she is the exact opposite  sebastian is still sebastian only less cute  less convincing as being stressed out  and the jokes just arent funny anymore  flounder has about 2 lines  he now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice  scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny  king tritons character is probably the best  he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter  melody  ariel and prince eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter   like i said  all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them  this is what they did  ursula  the new evil villain is morgana  ursulas sister who feels like she always lived in ursulas shadow  i wouldnt be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife  she cant do anything right and shes a failure as a villain  she has the same voice ursula did  sebastian   flounder   have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks  tip   dash  a walrus and a penguin  they try to be heros but always fail when trying  the plot is so predictable  they become heroes at the end  yawn  flatson  jetsom  now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton  hes really bad too  morgana and the shark  sharkbait  i think was his name  have no chemistry  good or bad  ariel ah  ariel  our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un lovely daughter  melody  melody cannot sing  her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be  and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet  she wants to go to the sea  she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her  she has to go find herself  yawn  not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is  certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original  basically  comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca  dont ever watch this  not even when your bored 
"Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a non-preachy documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China who live inside a factory compound. They play with toys, jump rope, and dance. Yet, the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work, and work -- but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch. The owner of the factory in China is amazingly open, so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he ""punishes"" the workers. Astutely following Mardi Gras beads from China to the Carnival, the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting, compelling footage from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers to each other through pictures. Here, the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never preachy, is not guilt driven, and allows everyone's point of view to be present. At the end, we -- the viewers -- make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film, and globalization.",1,wow  wow  wow  i have never seen a non preachy documentary on globalization until i saw mardi gras  made in china  this film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in china who live inside a factory compound  they play with toys  jump rope  and dance  yet  the majority of their days and nights consist of work  work  and work    but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch  the owner of the factory in china is amazingly open  so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he  punishes  the workers  astutely following mardi gras beads from china to the carnival  the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting  compelling footage from both cultures  one of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and mardi gras revelers to each other through pictures  here  the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation  the film is never preachy  is not guilt driven  and allows everyones point of view to be present  at the end  we    the viewers    make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film  and globalization 
"I had the privilege of watching Scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release. It was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough. <br /><br />Scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana. In this version, Tony comes to America during the Cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s, early 1980s. Tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in Tent City and after a brief stay at a Cuban restaurant; Tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction. <br /><br />Many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch I have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years. Robert Loggia as Tony's patron, Frank Lopez is wonderful. His character is flawed by being too trusting, and as Tony quickly figures out, soft. Lopez's right hand, Omar Suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors, F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus.) Suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for Frank; it is like he does not have a mind of his own. Tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with Suarez, but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top. The character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is Mel Bernstein, the audaciously corrupt Miami Narcotics detective played by Harris Yulin (Training Day.) Mel, without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry. He plays Tony off of Frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both Frank and Mel. It is priceless to hear Frank asking for Mel to intercede, as Tony is about to kill him only to hear Mel reply, `It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.' This is from the man who Frank had been paying for protection!<br /><br />Tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn. After offing Frank and taking his wife and business Tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough. As Tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs, greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married. This all sets up the ending in which Tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because Tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered. This all stems form a compassionate moment when Tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children.<br /><br />All in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture. DePalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around. The violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind, particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen, the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie. This is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish, or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels; DePalma let it all fly right here.",1,i had the privilege of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release  it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough   scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana  in this version  tony comes to america during the cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s  early 1980s  tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in tent city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant  tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction   many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years  robert loggia as tonys patron  frank lopez is wonderful  his character is flawed by being too trusting  and as tony quickly figures out  soft  lopezs right hand  omar suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors  f  murray abraham  amadeus   suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for frank  it is like he does not have a mind of his own  tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with suarez  but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top  the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel bernstein  the audaciously corrupt miami narcotics detective played by harris yulin  training day   mel  without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry  he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel  it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to intercede  as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel reply   its your tree frank  youre sitting in it  this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection  tonys rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn  after offing frank and taking his wife and business tonys greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough  as tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs  greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married  this all sets up the ending in which tonys compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered  this all stems form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victims wife and children  all in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture  depalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around  the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind  particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen  the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie  this is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish  or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels  depalma let it all fly right here 
"I read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot. I'm an open minded guy after all and I’ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks. As the end credits rolled on this one I searched for meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: ""This film was mercifully short."" That's all I got.<br /><br />Okay, Okay. The sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits. I did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd.<br /><br />By the time of the ""chicken dance"" at the finale I had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. I don't know what could have salvaged this film. The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should have sparked a doobie or drank a LOT of beer to get the full experience of the film. Either way, I'm not watching this film again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can tell myself “At least I wasn’t in ‘Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon.’ I’m better than those guys.""",0,i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot  im an open minded guy after all and i’ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks  as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say  here goes   this film was mercifully short   thats all i got  okay  okay  the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits  i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd  by the time of the  chicken dance  at the finale i had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall  i dont know what could have salvaged this film  the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasnt any way to make it watchable  not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts  maybe i should have sparked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film  either way  im not watching this film again unless im really depressed  then i can tell myself “at least i wasn’t in ‘dr  tarrs torture dungeon ’ i’m better than those guys  
"As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and co-workers of it. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he'd watch it. I lost. I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius. This film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow, and pathetic don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally bad movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad high school plays (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very juvenile) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too fake, but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script, not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly horrid the time I spent watching this was.

"True, it does not follow the book very closely, but it's still a very entertaining take on the story. Swayze was far better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoided the ""silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness"" portrayal most of us probably expected (cf. Kate Capshaw in ""Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom"").<br /><br />At any rate, it's amazingly better than Richard Chamberlain's awful pair of Quatermain flicks.<br /><br />It is very reminiscent of a western in many ways. About the only thing I didn't care for was all the mysticism, but I guess that is part and parcel of the genre. Like ""how can you have an African adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen?""

"Some funny bits, but come Bill! A film? Quoting Zeitgeist? Keep the TV Show and the interviews, but a film? I'm probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film... I don't know. I laughed, disagreed, agreed... this film is very confusing and inconsistent.<br /><br />Bill's a funny guy... but also very cocky... Bill's rhetoric is similar to Bill Hicks, a brilliant comedian. But like many comedians, the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying. I think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility. This might be just a personal taste, but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth. Bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism. I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible, but the response to it cannot be sensible. It will create unnecessary turmoil. We can do better than just react to fundamentalism. His conclusion is that ""we don't know"" and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything, to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion. His humility that he only knows that he doesn't, is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non-sense.<br /><br />I had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist, the movie in Bill's film. All the astrotheology-influenced non-sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing. Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship. It is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources. Astro-mystic sources that reduce everything to ""the stars say it all"" seem to be from the Middle Ages. This film is a confusing statement from a confused ""agnostic"". Agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as ""we don't know"".<br /><br />This film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history.<br /><br />Watch the film (it has hilarious interviews and bits) but PLEASE do not behave like Bill. You cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line. His arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting, provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation.. There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues.",0,some funny bits  but come bill  a film  quoting zeitgeist  keep the tv show and the interviews  but a film  im probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film    i dont know  i laughed  disagreed  agreed    this film is very confusing and inconsistent  bills a funny guy    but also very cocky    bills rhetoric is similar to bill hicks  a brilliant comedian  but like many comedians  the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying  i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility  this might be just a personal taste  but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth  bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism  i agree with bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible  but the response to it cannot be sensible  it will create unnecessary turmoil  we can do better than just react to fundamentalism  his conclusion is that  we dont know  and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything  to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion  his humility that he only knows that he doesnt  is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non sense  i had great trouble seeing bits of zeitgeist  the movie in bills film  all the astrotheology influenced non sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing  zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable religion studies scholarship  it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources  astro mystic sources that reduce everything to  the stars say it all  seem to be from the middle ages  this film is a confusing statement from a confused  agnostic   agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as  we dont know   this film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history  watch the film  it has hilarious interviews and bits  but please do not behave like bill  you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line  his arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting  provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation   there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues 
"This is a film that takes some digesting. On the one hand, we are offered a tough outward shell, a story that does not only derive the Catholic Church, but does so foolishly, and uninformed. On an inner layer, we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis, and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand.<br /><br />At first glance, it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; the humor is awkward and poorly delivered. In particular, Ms. Keaton's performance is flighty and over the top, well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is again the model of stridence, with her hi-pitched voice and whining style. All of this could be forgiven if it weren't for the last 20 minutes of this movie, that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981.<br /><br />***Careful, spoilers ahead***<br /><br />It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius, by the way, is a male name, and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact, just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with.) When they all admit that they don't live up to the church's teachings, the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny, all-too-cliché sepia-tone flashbacks. When one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more abusive, until the pupil pulls out a gun. After wrestling it away from her, the nun kills the pupil, presumably in self-defense. She then goes on a screaming rampage, killing a gay former student because of his sins. The last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a Christ-like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her. Can you say `heavy handed?' I knew you could!<br /><br />I know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result, but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie. I have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously, no pun intended. This explanation is hard to swallow, though, simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply anti-Catholic tripe, which in the name of fairness and equality, is mean spirited and hateful.<br /><br />This is a film I would recommend for a catholic, namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today. If it were `Rabbi Ray explains it all' or `Imam Muhammad explains it all', there would be rioting in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription. But, sadly, because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view.<br /><br />I certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic, so it wasn't just ignorance that brought them to make this film.<br /><br />I give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, poorly directed and just a bad movie in general.

"Madhur Bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today.<br /><br />Celebrities party endlessly, they like to be seen at these parties, and to get due exposure in the media. In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this. IMO there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a ""I need you, you need me"" kind of relationship. However, the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa. Anyhow, in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column (page 3 of the newspaper) reporter Konkana Sen Sharma. She is shown as this celebrity maker, very popular at the social gatherings. She has a good friend in the gay Abhijeet and in the struggling model Rohit (Bikram Saluja). She rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy Pearl (Sandhya Mridul), and a struggling actress - Gayatri (Tara Sharma). The editor of the newspaper is Boman Irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by Atul Kulkarni. The movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level. The rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part, the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios, exploitation of power, hunger for media exposure. Into all this is layered in homosexuality, a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot, rampant drug use, pedophilia, police ""encounter"" deaths. In light of all this Pearl's desire to have a super rich husband, a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car, the bitching women, all seem benign ills.<br /><br />The film has absolutely excellent acting by Konkana Sen Sharma, Atul Kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion. But the supporting cast is more than competent (Boman Irani is very good). This is what saves the film for me. Mr. Bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash. I wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively. He berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful. We have an item number in the framework of a Bollywood theme party, the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a Western beat. I hope the next one from Madhur Bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the Hindi film stereotyped ingredients. The film is a brave (albeit flawed) effort, certainly worth a watch.",1,madhur bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today  celebrities party endlessly  they like to be seen at these parties  and to get due exposure in the media  in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this  imo there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a  i need you  you need me  kind of relationship  however  the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa  anyhow  in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column  page 3 of the newspaper  reporter konkana sen sharma  she is shown as this celebrity maker  very popular at the social gatherings  she has a good friend in the gay abhijeet and in the struggling model rohit  bikram saluja   she rooms with an air hostess  the sassy pearl  sandhya mridul   and a struggling actress   gayatri  tara sharma   the editor of the newspaper is boman irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by atul kulkarni  the movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level  the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part  the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios  exploitation of power  hunger for media exposure  into all this is layered in homosexuality  a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot  rampant drug use  pedophilia  police  encounter  deaths  in light of all this pearls desire to have a super rich husband  a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car  the bitching women  all seem benign ills  the film has absolutely excellent acting by konkana sen sharma  atul kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion  but the supporting cast is more than competent  boman irani is very good   this is what saves the film for me  mr  bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash  i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively  he berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful  we have an item number in the framework of a bollywood theme party  the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat  i hope the next one from madhur bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients  the film is a brave  albeit flawed  effort  certainly worth a watch 
"What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band. This disc is NOT for the faint of heart...the music is incredibly intense, and VERY cool. What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so huge for so long. It is true that their records were great, but their shows were the top of the heap. In 1969 when this concert was shot, the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone and bands (and audiences) had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity--something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert out, it really is amazing.",1,what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band  this disc is not for the faint of heart   the music is incredibly intense  and very cool  what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long  it is true that their records were great  but their shows were the top of the heap  in 1969 when this concert was shot  the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands  and audiences  had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity  something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina  what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise  try the concert out  it really is amazing 
"Caution: May contain spoilers...<br /><br />I've seen this movie 3 times & I've liked it every time. Upon seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is. An HBO TV movie- very well done like most of their movies are- this would've gotten Oscars for it's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for TV.<br /><br />As I'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial murderer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried & couldn't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders.) The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in America, investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain & frustration. According to this acct, Burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it. He followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner.<br /><br />Rea's performance is so well done, he doesn't overact, chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer. He is a man with passion, but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies. He only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. He just *is* - His character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, driven to frustration, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year. Of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. He makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility.<br /><br />A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was one which produces such ""monsters."" The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (impossible though it may seem) elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself. Perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong? Either way, his performance is very well done.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a great job. He starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakov. But he eventually becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for.<br /><br />Although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself. All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay. The screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does: give factual events & place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people *behind* the facts.<br /><br />9 out of 10 stars",1,caution  may contain spoilers    ive seen this movie 3 times   ive liked it every time  upon seeing it again  im always reminded of how good it is  an hbo tv movie  very well done like most of their movies are  this wouldve gotten oscars for its performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tv  as im sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here  this is the story of serial murderer  andrei chikatilo  he murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former soviet union   3 victims were buried   couldnt be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders   the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst  victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea  a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks  his part is essential to be sure  there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america  investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain   frustration  according to this acct  burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it  he followed the case to its conclusion  3 years later  in this scene  his superior  general fetisov  played by donald sutherland  actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he shouldve given him a break sooner  reas performance is so well done  he doesnt overact  chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer  he is a man with passion  but doesnt show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies  he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances  rea does so much with his face  his eyes  he doesnt need to overact  he just  is    his character  so frustrated after so long  at one point  driven to frustration  he actually says hed rather find 3 at one time than none in a year  of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die  he just wants some clues to catch this man  rea makes us feel for this man  he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility  a mutant to be sure  chikatilos childhood was one which produces such  monsters   the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn  he somehow  impossible though it may seem  elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself  perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong  either way  his performance is very well done  donald sutherland as colonel fetisov  later promoted to general  also does a great job  he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesnt seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov  but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant  he actually actively participates in helping burakov  there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for  although this movie deals with a morbid  grotesque and violent story  it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself  all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay  the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does  give factual events   place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people  behind  the facts  9 out of 10 stars
"This movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man, and how he must deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister is somewhat accepting. The relationship looks good with his boyfriend/exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn't mean anything. Our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves, dumping his new lover and starting over. We are left with him starting over and viewing, not participating, in happiness. So maybe things will go better for him in the future. The ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so I will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating.",1,this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man  and how he must deal with everyone  his mother is depressed  his younger sister is a pain  his older sister is somewhat accepting  the relationship looks good with his boyfriend exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy  unfortunately  the new guy screws around on him and says it really didnt mean anything  our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves  dumping his new lover and starting over  we are left with him starting over and viewing  not participating  in happiness  so maybe things will go better for him in the future  the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating 
"Flame in, flame out. That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster films, but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD sci-fi collection put out by Mill Creek/Treeline Films. It's a great value at about twenty five bucks, so at fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings.<br /><br />Gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast, and he's not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it out on Tokyo, setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet. They arrive at 'Plan Z', the hope of the world, and wouldn't you know it, there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the 'Z Plan' building; that was a nice touch.<br /><br />By the mid 1960's, this country still wasn't quite politically correct. One of the American military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee. I guess there weren't any privates around.<br /><br />Good old Gammera was quite the sight though, walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged. That's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship, whisking him off to Mars to save the world. High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save, now let's get back to the Cold War.<br /><br />Like Godzilla, Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films, but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. Especially since that DVD pack I mentioned earlier has ""Attack of the Monsters"" with a featured guest appearance by the Big G. It took all I had to make it through to the end of both films; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said 'Gammera, Sayonara!""",0,flame in  flame out  that seems to be gammera in a nutshell  a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon  im not a fan of japanese monster films  but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci fi collection put out by mill creek treeline films  its a great value at about twenty five bucks  so at fifty cents per movie  it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings  gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast  and hes not happy  like godzilla  he takes it out on tokyo  setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet  they arrive at plan z  the hope of the world  and wouldnt you know it  theres a scene where a huge shed is shown thats called the z plan building  that was a nice touch  by the mid 1960s  this country still wasnt quite politically correct  one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee  i guess there werent any privates around  good old gammera was quite the sight though  walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged  thats why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship  whisking him off to mars to save the world  high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save  now lets get back to the cold war  like godzilla  gammera spawned at least a good dozen films  but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying  flaming turtles  especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has  attack of the monsters  with a featured guest appearance by the big g  it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films  it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said gammera  sayonara

"The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like him when he's out of control, of course, but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back. She finds him through a stool pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters loyalties (that, and the fact that she learns she's working for communists; the Cold War stuff is really interesting). The love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable, but it's not so bad that it harms the film (unlike Fuller's previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema. I will never forget that. 10/10.",1,the best of the seven sam fuller movies that ive seen  including park row  run of the arrow  verboten   shock corridor  the naked kiss  the big red one  and this film   pickup on south street counts as one of the best film noirs  it represents fuller at his most controlled  i like him when hes out of control  of course  but nearly everything in pickup is perfect  the film is absolutely beautiful  richard widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies  jean peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend  played by richard kiley  peters is forced to find widmark and get it back  she finds him through a stool pigeon played by thelma ritter  widmark and peters are attracted to each other  which changes peters loyalties  that  and the fact that she learns shes working for communists  the cold war stuff is really interesting   the love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable  but its not so bad that it harms the film  unlike fullers previous film  park row   richard widmark is great  this must be one of his best roles  but im not so familiar with his career that i can say that for sure  thelma ritter gives the most memorable performance  her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance  and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema  i will never forget that  10 10 
"It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.<br /><br />The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover. In a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve. It's probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story.<br /><br />HEDY LAMARR is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.<br /><br />The swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. The love-making scene, later on, is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so. More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.<br /><br />Not so. It's disappointing, primitively crude in its sound portions (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and on the basis of it, gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in her work that I didn't.<br /><br />It's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work.

"It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this ""movie."" No wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing. She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.<br /><br />The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC.<br /><br />**After she leaves the mall, she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her. Tell me, what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally? I don't mean after an attack had already started, because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back. But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level. No woman would do that unless she 1) had a weapon, 2) has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them. None of that applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged. And by the way, when the security guard approached, as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger, why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help, or scream?? <br /><br />**When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town, and crashes. She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers, instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. I understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should've ran.<br /><br />(I didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie, because I loathe people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it).<br /><br />**Why would she carry a loud, Red Toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark? When she does get caught, one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox. First she resists, then eventually opens it. And takes out a wrench. This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie. When asked to open the box, she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch/push/open/manipulate, and once that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical/shoot him in the face/render him unconscious, which was the hero's plan all along. It feels like that's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs, and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs.<br /><br />**Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban house wife, sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS.<br /><br />**When she was running away, how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude. She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them.<br /><br />**Finally, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her. How ridiculous. As one of the thugs even said, they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't get the license plate. Even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor, how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?",0,it says that a girl named susan montford both wrote and directed this  movie   no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing  she made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career  this is one of the worst human creations of this millennium  the fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs  is the blatant and complete lack of logic    after she leaves the mall  she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her  tell me  what woman would aggressively shove a potential attacker while being surrounded  and insult them verbally  i dont mean after an attack had already started  because then of course its completely normal for someone to fight back  but she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level  no woman would do that unless she 1  had a weapon  2  has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close  and so is relatively safe from harm  or 3  the attackers are so young  and weak looking that shes pretty sure she can take them  none of that applied in this situation  so she was just acting like someone thats asking to get raped or mugged  and by the way  when the security guard approached  as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger  why wouldnt she immediately either run towards him for help  or scream      when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head  she drives into a deserted part of town  and crashes  she had a good three minute lead on the pursuers  instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing  she gets out her red toolbox and starts messing around under her hood  i understand she was trying to fix her car  but she shouldve ran   i didnt even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie  because i loathe people who do that in their reviews  but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on it     why would she carry a loud  red toolbox as shes trying to sneak away in the dark  when she does get caught  one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox  first she resists  then eventually opens it  and takes out a wrench  this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down  its one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie  when asked to open the box  shes resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didnt open it  in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch push open manipulate  and once that hero refuses to open it  the enemy grabs that device  only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical shoot him in the face render him unconscious  which was the heros plan all along  it feels like thats what they tried to do with kim basinger here  as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a wrench and dispatches one of the thugs  and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugs    throughout the rest of the movie  basically what you see is this suburban house wife  sneaking around the woods as she carries her red toolbox  taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackers    when she was running away  how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were  i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude  she somehow crept up on them when i thought she was moving away from them    finally  this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason shes being chased in the first place is because from the thugs perspective  she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier  and so they felt they had to kill her  how ridiculous  as one of the thugs even said  they couldve just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from  no one but her had seen them anyway  and she probably didnt get the license plate  even if these possibilities wouldnt work in their favor  how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder 
"""They All Laughed"" is one of those little movies I am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary. Even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth. But, that said, this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going, and ""TAL"" is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale. It is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast: Colleen Camp's simultaneously shouting orders at John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat; and especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls for John Ritter and says, ""How...weird."" It's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face.",1, they all laughed  is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary  it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past  but seems more contemporary  even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesnt date it too much  bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet  that reality never brings it crashing down to earth  but  that said  this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going  and  tal  is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale  it is a movie that wouldnt linger so long in the memory if it werent for the little moments provided by the excellent cast  colleen camps simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog  blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat  and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says   how   weird   its such a piece of fluff one doesnt want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it  but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on ones face

"Believe me, I wanted to like ""Spirit"". The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned, hand-drawn animation again, as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago, and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete, had got my blood up ... but then, the insulting, flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of ""Spirit"" got my blood up even more.<br /><br />The character designs are generic, the animation (partly as a result) merely competent, the art direction as a whole so utterly, boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about (we know, from ""The Prince of Egypt"" and ""The Road to El-Dorado"", that there are talented artists at Dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every single instance ill-judged. (Why do they bother?) There's not a single thing worth LOOKING at. In an animated cartoon, this is fatal.<br /><br />But it gets worse...<br /><br />The horses can't talk, but they're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in ""Bambi"", which can. And it seems that, in a way, the horses CAN talk. Spirit himself delivers the prologue (sounding for all the world like a 21st-Century actor picked out of a shopping mall in California), and from then on his laid-back, decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack, although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know, or expresses a feeling which the artwork, poor though it is, wasn't capable of expressing twice as well. That prologue, by the way: (a) contains information which Spirit, we later discover, had know way of knowing; (b) expresses ideas which Spirit would lack the power to express even if he COULD talk; (c) includes new age rubbish like, ""This story may not be true, but it's what I remember""; and (d) will give countless children (the production is pitched, I presume, at six-year-olds) the impression that horses are native to North America, which is sort of true, in that the common ancestor of domestic horses, zebras etc. WAS native to North America - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived, and the mustangs of Spirit's herd (which allegedly ""belong here like the buffalo grass"") were descended from horses introduced by Europeans.<br /><br />So the prologue rather annoyed me.<br /><br />As often as Spirit talks, Bryan Adams sings, sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat infection - and it's not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings, it's WHAT he sings: maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less, if possible, than Spirit's spoken narrative, and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune (although I was paying close attention, and was able to discern that they probably didn't). If only Bryan Adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two, the movie might have been allowed to take its true form: mediocre and derivative, rather than jaw-droppingly bad.",0,believe me  i wanted to like  spirit   the idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old fashioned  hand drawn animation again  as if the last pencil animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago  and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete  had got my blood up     but then  the insulting  flavourless banality i had to endure in the first ten minutes of  spirit  got my blood up even more  the character designs are generic  the animation  partly as a result  merely competent  the art direction as a whole so utterly  boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about  we know  from  the prince of egypt  and  the road to el dorado   that there are talented artists at dreamworks   and the sophisticated use of cgi is in every single instance ill judged   why do they bother   theres not a single thing worth looking at  in an animated cartoon  this is fatal  but it gets worse    the horses cant talk  but theyre far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in  bambi   which can  and it seems that  in a way  the horses can talk  spirit himself delivers the prologue  sounding for all the world like a 21st century actor picked out of a shopping mall in california   and from then on his laid back  decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack  although it never once tells us anything that we didnt already know  or expresses a feeling which the artwork  poor though it is  wasnt capable of expressing twice as well  that prologue  by the way   a  contains information which spirit  we later discover  had know way of knowing   b  expresses ideas which spirit would lack the power to express even if he could talk   c  includes new age rubbish like   this story may not be true  but its what i remember   and  d  will give countless children  the production is pitched  i presume  at six year olds  the impression that horses are native to north america  which is sort of true  in that the common ancestor of domestic horses  zebras etc  was native to north america   but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived  and the mustangs of spirits herd  which allegedly  belong here like the buffalo grass   were descended from horses introduced by europeans  so the prologue rather annoyed me  as often as spirit talks  bryan adams sings  sounding as usual as though hes got a bad throat infection   and its not that he sings or even how he sings  its what he sings  maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less  if possible  than spirits spoken narrative  and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune  although i was paying close attention  and was able to discern that they probably didnt   if only bryan adams and the guy pretending to be a horse could have shut up for a minute or two  the movie might have been allowed to take its true form  mediocre and derivative  rather than jaw droppingly bad

"I watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away. It is a real masterpiece of art and I don't understand why most of the people think it's garbage. The main idea of the movie - take your ego away and then you will have true power! This was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way. ""The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look"" - do you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego... That voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take, that creates our aggression, that wants to be in control, that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts.

"honestly, where can I begin! This was a low budget, HORRIBLY acted film, it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was! the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights, they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal-mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling!! Me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there it was The Sawtooth Island movie. I mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home I practically died after the first scene.<br /><br />Oh and the plot of the film, the story board, the script, etc..was a bunch of garbage that I don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it!! But if you happen to stumble upon this movie..do not get it!!!!!",0,honestly  where can i begin  this was a low budget  horribly acted film  it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was  the sword fighting scenes werent even sword fights  they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling   me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day  so we decided to go to the store and look for one  and there it was the sawtooth island movie  i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene  oh and the plot of the film  the story board  the script  etc  was a bunch of garbage that i dont even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it   but if you happen to stumble upon this movie  do not get it     
"Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, the thick writing of it, and Harrison Ford being in a buddy-cop comedy ! Here's 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better.<br /><br />The buddy-cop movies are fun. However their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s. Making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of Hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask God to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than (Hollywood Homicide).<br /><br />What really did happen to this entertaining formula ?! Since a whole decade the things hadn't been the same. You'd have a buddy-action stubborn flop after another. I'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well : (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them all yet (Miami Vice - 2006) ! <br /><br />I believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and TV shows during 2 decades already. Add to that, particularly here, the negligent dealing and the dull humor. Actually the matter this time is totally unbearable. Yes, we've got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs, and the background of sinful city, but what else was new ?! It's not about cliché; it's about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly made.<br /><br />The acting, especially from (Hartnett)'s side, is terrible. This guy is anything but a comedian (or actor !). So his character was wanting to revenge for his father's death ! Revenge on yourself man, he probably died out of watching your acting !!. Even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy (or that's what they seemed here anyhow !).<br /><br />The directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh, some parts managed to be highly dull (arresting the black guy through the lack ??) ; it's a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action/comedy ! They didn't utilize Hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm, or even as a place which's full of shining or fallen stars (cameos that could've given it few interesting moments).<br /><br />It's a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars' glamour, and as being a Buddy-cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself ! Guess who ?!), and a Buddy-Cop destroyer more than movie ! God, don't make me, or my children, live enough to witness (Hollywood Homicide  Part 2) ! At last, look at Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we didn't.",0,josh hartnetts dead eyes  the thick writing of it  and harrison ford being in a buddy cop comedy   heres 3 reasons to hate it  avoid it  and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better  the buddy cop movies are fun  however their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s  making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than  hollywood homicide   what really did happen to this entertaining formula    since a whole decade the things hadnt been the same  youd have a buddy action stubborn flop after another  ill delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well    i spy   2002    national security   2003    taxi   2004    starsky   hutch   2004   and the worst of them all yet  miami vice   2006     i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during 2 decades already  add to that  particularly here  the negligent dealing and the dull humor  actually the matter this time is totally unbearable  yes  weve got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs  and the background of sinful city  but what else was new    its not about cliché  its about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly made  the acting  especially from  hartnett s side  is terrible  this guy is anything but a comedian  or actor     so his character was wanting to revenge for his fathers death   revenge on yourself man  he probably died out of watching your acting     even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy  or thats what they seemed here anyhow     the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh  some parts managed to be highly dull  arresting the black guy through the lack       its a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action comedy   they didnt utilize hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm  or even as a place whichs full of shining or fallen stars  cameos that couldve given it few interesting moments   its a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars glamour  and as being a buddy cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non chemistry on the screen  one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself   guess who      and a buddy cop destroyer more than movie   god  dont make me  or my children  live enough to witness  hollywood homicide  part 2    at last  look at harrison fords performance  he wanted to have a good time  but at least we didnt

"Kim (Patricia Clarkson), George (Jake Weber) and son Miles (Erik Per Sullivan) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan's bustling metropolis. On the way, they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow. A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along. Rather than helping, at least one of the hunters, Otis (John Speredakos), is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers. George, Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis, and even worse, we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they're staying. Meanwhile, Miles is given a wendigo (a kind of Indian shape-shifting spirit/monster) token by an Indian whom only he has seen. Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes? Are there wendigos in the woods? <br /><br />I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers. It is a fairly low budget film, with technical limitations frequently showing through. Much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature. And perhaps the fatal blow for many people, it has a very ambiguous ending, with a number of questions left unanswered. If you are discouraged by such endings, and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant, do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.<br /><br />Personally, I like films like that. I usually prefer some ambiguity. The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick, scary creature flick, where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end, and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2: The Monster Returns, but that's not what this film is. Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people. Heck, writer/director Larry Fessenden even has a character, George, reciting Robert Frost. The Frost poem, and George's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things, is the key to the film.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is its complexity. In a way, there are four different films occurring at the same time, a thread from each character. In George's thread, he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world, and he has some parenting problems. For him, the film is a realistic, horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse. In Patricia's thread, she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family. She's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her, hoping that they'll go away and get better. In Otis' thread, he's even more down on his luck than George, and George's arrival into his life symbolizes the final ""crack"" in his psychological armor. And in Miles' thread, which is probably the most important of the film, life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world. But this is a horror story, after all, albeit one with a glimmer of hope, and the events in the film give Miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn. Still, when everything is said and done, he seems to be the only one retaining his composure, due to the poetic outlook.<br /><br />Even though the film is low budget, there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions. Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations, and created some interesting slide show like montages (such as the cards, or the Indian wendigo images from the book). There are also interesting more traditional montages, such as Miles' nightmare. Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.<br /><br />Other technical aspects are good for the budget. The ""Wendigo"" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous. The lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been, but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock (it could have been digital instead) or transfer. I thought the performances were good and far more realistic (if you value that) than the majority of films. Although I didn't really notice the score, it must have been okay, or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment.<br /><br />Overall, Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions, as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch.",1,kim  patricia clarkson   george  jake weber  and son miles  erik per sullivan  are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattans bustling metropolis  on the way  they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow  a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along  rather than helping  at least one of the hunters  otis  john speredakos   is mad because the accident cracked the bucks antlers  george  kim and miles are disturbed by otis  and even worse  we quickly learn that otis has learned where theyre staying  meanwhile  miles is given a wendigo  a kind of indian shape shifting spirit monster  token by an indian whom only he has seen  is otis a psycho out to get our heroes  are there wendigos in the woods   i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers  it is a fairly low budget film  with technical limitations frequently showing through  much of the film  and maybe all of it  is not really about the titular creature  and perhaps the fatal blow for many people  it has a very ambiguous ending  with a number of questions left unanswered  if you are discouraged by such endings  and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant  do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo  personally  i like films like that  i usually prefer some ambiguity  the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick  scary creature flick  where theyd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end  and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2  the monster returns  but thats not what this film is  wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people  heck  writer director larry fessenden even has a character  george  reciting robert frost  the frost poem  and georges comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things  is the key to the film  one of the best things about the film is its complexity  in a way  there are four different films occurring at the same time  a thread from each character  in georges thread  he isnt exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world  and he has some parenting problems  for him  the film is a realistic  horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse  in patricias thread  shes looking for rejuvenation of her life and family  shes a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her  hoping that theyll go away and get better  in otis thread  hes even more down on his luck than george  and georges arrival into his life symbolizes the final  crack  in his psychological armor  and in miles thread  which is probably the most important of the film  life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world  but this is a horror story  after all  albeit one with a glimmer of hope  and the events in the film give miles poetic interpretations a dark turn  still  when everything is said and done  he seems to be the only one retaining his composure  due to the poetic outlook  even though the film is low budget  there are a lot of well executed higher budget ambitions  fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations  and created some interesting slide show like montages  such as the cards  or the indian wendigo images from the book   there are also interesting more traditional montages  such as miles nightmare  wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films  other technical aspects are good for the budget  the  wendigo  appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous  the lighting was usually good  there were a few times that dark scenes werent as clear as they could have been  but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock  it could have been digital instead  or transfer  i thought the performances were good and far more realistic  if you value that  than the majority of films  although i didnt really notice the score  it must have been okay  or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment  overall  wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions  as long as you dont mind having to think about the movies you watch 
"A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a terrific supporting cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns.<br /><br />Typically silly plot for an Astaire film has him as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen his secretary. They concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right. He runs into Fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father. Silly plot.<br /><br />The great songs include A Foggy Day, Things Are Looking Up, Nice Work if You Can get It, and I Can't Be Bothered Now. Fontaine does not sing, but does a brief (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park.<br /><br />Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite--Jan Duggan as the lead madrigal singer.<br /><br />Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings Nice Work if You Can Get It. Her facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a scene stealer in the W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday.<br /><br />Much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been hideously miscast. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes. Two more would-be disasters. Fontaine is fine as Alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with ample comic relief by Burns and Allen.<br /><br />Fun film, great songs, good cast, and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!",1,a damsel in distress is a delight because of the great gershwin songs  fred astaire  joan fontaine  and a terrific supporting cast headed by gracie allen and george burns  typically silly plot for an astaire film has him as an american dance star in england with burns as his publicist and allen his secretary  they concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right  he runs into fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father  silly plot  the great songs include a foggy day  things are looking up  nice work if you can get it  and i cant be bothered now  fontaine does not sing  but does a brief  and decent  number with astaire  surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with astaire are burns and allen  including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park  also in the cast are reginald gardiner  constance collier  montagu love  harry watson  as albert   ray noble  and my favorite  jan duggan as the lead madrigal singer  jan duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings nice work if you can get it  her facial expressions are hilarious  she was also a scene stealer in the w c  fields comedy  the old fashioned way  playing cleopatra pepperday  much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of ginger rogers  who  as noted elsewhere  would have been hideously miscast  the tcm host notes that ruby keeler and jessie matthews were considered  yikes  two more would be disasters  fontaine is fine as alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to astaire  with ample comic relief by burns and allen  fun film  great songs  good cast  and jan duggan in a rare spotlight 
"Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director. In keeping with Miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script, this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with. What takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same-old however, is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's cinema. And this isn't that nice cool, clean violence so beloved of US cinema - this stuff is nasty, painful and HURTS! That said, the pace is breakneck, the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities, Miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be, making it hard to look away from the screen, whatever he might be showing you! It doesn't have the ""Ohmigod"" ending of ""Dead Or Alive,"" but if you're not squeamish, now's the time to get on board the Miike bandwagon before he ends up on some Hollywood studio's ""new John Woo"" shopping list...",1,anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miikes work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director  in keeping with miikes working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script  this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller  with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with  what takes the movie out of the realms of the same old same old however  is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in todays cinema  and this isnt that nice cool  clean violence so beloved of us cinema   this stuff is nasty  painful and hurts  that said  the pace is breakneck  the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities  miikes sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments  and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be  making it hard to look away from the screen  whatever he might be showing you  it doesnt have the  ohmigod  ending of  dead or alive   but if youre not squeamish  nows the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studios  new john woo  shopping list   
"What do I say about such an absolutely beautiful film? I saw this at the Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon considering that this is my main town. I am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type films. I happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when I noticed this film playing in the morning. This is not a sci-fi nor action film of any sort. Let me just start out by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade nor of Eric Etebari, having watched a few episodes(his performance in that seemed stale and robotic). But he managed to really win me over in this performance. I mean really win me over. Having seen Cellular, I did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon. But there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me. I later looked it up online and found that Eric won the Best Actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect. Now I keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very nicely done but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more his goal(Seeing films like Godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off). I could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never an easy one. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse. This is one film that I think about constantly and would highly recommend.",1,what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film  i saw this at the atlanta  georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town  i am very much a sci fi aficionado and enjoy action type films  i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning  this is not a sci fi nor action film of any sort  let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari  having watched a few episodes his performance in that seemed stale and robotic   but he managed to really win me over in this performance  i mean really win me over  having seen cellular  i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy  but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing  he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon  but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me  i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect  now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them  sorry brian   they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story   which i think was even more his goal seeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off   i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head  the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one  i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse  this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend

"I try to be very objective when I view a low budget movie. I also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions. I expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios. Therefore I apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases. But this movie was just a dud. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world. Also, to make this movie more mysterious, the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse.<br /><br />Once again another disappointing movie that I could only give three points to.",0,i try to be very objective when i view a low budget movie  i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions  i expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios  therefore i apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases  but this movie was just a dud  period  the premise was terrible  the main character  mary gordano  alicia silverstone   was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes  there was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world  also  to make this movie more mysterious  the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood  especially in the warehouse  once again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to 
"The planning episodes were a bit dull, but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch. The reason why I call it the most realistic reality show is because, much to my surprise,Charley fell out of the race relatively early. When his hands were sore, I expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix, but instead he actually quit the race. The most anxious moment of the show must've been when Max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food! The ending was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the team make it. Overall, not as great as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting watch, as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world.",1,the planning episodes were a bit dull  but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch  the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because  much to my surprise charley fell out of the race relatively early  when his hands were sore  i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix  but instead he actually quit the race  the most anxious moment of the show mustve been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food  the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it  overall  not as great as the long way round  but definitely an interesting watch  as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world

"This series could very well be the best Britcom ever, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbours, to name just two).<br /><br />What made Butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in Britain at the time.<br /><br />I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it. The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in North America at the time. Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. These people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. They were examples of the ""New Europeans"" that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (1980s).<br /><br />Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in American movies and TV, but not with the intensity of Butterflies or the movie Montenegro). And, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. A potential affair that was not really about sex, or even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief... at the time anyway.<br /><br />Butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic. It documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships).

"This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.<br /><br />I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br />Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~",1,this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone  on my list of favorite movies  mental list  mind  the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series  spirited away and fly away home  i can really relate to the main character jess  at the start of the movie shes a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls  she really sucks you into her life  i also certainly cant fault any of the protagonists acting  or anyone elses in the film  the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules  the movie is never boring  the romance is really cute and didnt make me blush tooooo hard  one thing that really made it though was the indian factor  jess parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else  the indian people are also hilarious  essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it  feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film  theyre funny  theyre refreshing and they make you feel good     
"I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time, or my friend's. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that old people have a past before they got old (no kidding). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.",0,i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting  i never had to read this book  thankfully   or it would have been a painful experience  i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasnt worth my time  or my friends  i think this story is not worth telling  its like saying that old people have a past before they got old  no kidding   the lives of the main characters were painful to watch  one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes  however  i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story  ive always been a big fan of ellen burstyn  im writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given  which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try 
"What a complete waste of time. The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending. I liked some of the characters and I was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end. It just doesn't happen. It's a total ""Wrestler"" ending with none of the good acting. I can't believe I spent the time watching this. It's not ""fun"" as some people put it. A guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out. The connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first.",0,what a complete waste of time  the movie starts as a clone of the saw series  but with even worse acting  melissa joan hart is absolutely horrible  the ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists  not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending  i liked some of the characters and i was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end  it just doesnt happen  its a total  wrestler  ending with none of the good acting  i cant believe i spent the time watching this  its not  fun  as some people put it  a guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out  the connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first 
"The plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination. However, there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found. Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film, an old man living by himself in a house. During the film I found that I was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit did not engage me; I found the tempo of the film a little too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took too long. I feel more could have been made of the relationship, ghostly encounters, with the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.",0,the plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods  soft for digging follows the old mans attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination  however  there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found  soft for digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film  an old man living by himself in a house  during the film i found that i was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man  the rest of the film i have to admit did not engage me  i found the tempo of the film a little too slow  the limited dialogue was not a problem  however  the development of the story and its conclusions  after watching the film  took too long  i feel more could have been made of the relationship  ghostly encounters  with the child and the old man  alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations  children are always scary as ghosts  see dark water 
"I loved this movie. First, because it is a family movie. Second, because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of HIV in a family, with far less hysteria than what I have normally seen in the movies. The brothers are very close, yet are not judgmental. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but not needed in the end. I understand that Leo's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I can't believe that this was a french television programme. It had great production values. I gave this movie a ten, and I think you will too, once you have seen it.",1,i loved this movie  first  because it is a family movie  second  because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family  with far less hysteria than what i have normally seen in the movies  the brothers are very close  yet are not judgmental  their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble  but not needed in the end  i understand that leos choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people  but i believed it was the right choice for him  i cant believe that this was a french television programme  it had great production values  i gave this movie a ten  and i think you will too  once you have seen it 
"Unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event, but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame (I get the impression Ben Coccio is an avid gamer), or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message (we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning ALL their cd's, talk about subtlety!), but the movie only gets away with it because its 'fiction'. Nice try. Yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence, but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media? or video games? We dont, and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media, yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground? haha I somehow dont think so.<br /><br />The movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families, its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn't a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates.

"This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick. The video is dark and poorly lit. The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun! [filled of course with silver bullets]. The acting is as wooden as the characters. The FX are non-existent,lots of extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and biting. the only thing that is shown is lots of soft-core T&A. Instead of dropping $30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic: ""Dog Soldiers"" with Sean Pertwee.",0,this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick  the video is dark and poorly lit  the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed  the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun   filled of course with silver bullets   the acting is as wooden as the characters  the fx are non existent lots of extreme close ups of werewolf jaws and biting  the only thing that is shown is lots of soft core t a  instead of dropping  30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic   dog soldiers  with sean pertwee 
"As a long time Red Sox fan, I just had to go see the movie. It was great! While there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 Red Sox season, there were great shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the movie is certainly a chick flick, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans that were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious! A must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse, date, or significant other...especially if you are a baseball fan...and even more especially if you are Red Sox fan!!!",1,as a long time red sox fan  i just had to go see the movie  it was great  while there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 red sox season  there were great shots of some of my favorite red sox players  while the movie is certainly a chick flick  it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 red sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time  i especially enjoyed the red sox fans that were part of bens baseball family  the scene where ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious  a must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse  date  or significant other   especially if you are a baseball fan   and even more especially if you are red sox fan   
"I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland.<br /><br />The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism.<br /><br />Nineties' values about 'machismo', masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish 'psyche' which leads to violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields ..blah..blah.. - is given a symbolic stature, i.e. poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause. Tedious, ahistorical, cheap and nasty trash.

"- A newlywed couple move into the home of the husband's dead former wife. It's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesn't want her in the house. She sees skulls all around the house. But when the husband investigates, he can't find anything. Is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from? Or, is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /><br />- This is the first time that I've watched The Screaming Skull without the assistance of the MST3K crew. And, it will in all likelihood be the last time I watch it this way. Can you say dull? I'm not talking ordinary dull - I'm talking watching grass grow dull. There are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens. The screen could have gone blank and I would have gotten as much entertainment out of it. The characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The Screaming Skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide.<br /><br />- The actors don't help matters much. Most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play. I haven't looked it up, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value. I won't even go into the script the actors are given to work with. Let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film.<br /><br />- You've been warned!

"I watched the McCoys reunion and was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez!!!To see them now was wonderful, because I always watched the show growing up so when the TV said that there was going to be a reunion I was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman(little Luke) was not on there.I know that Walter Brennan had died. So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reed( Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke I would be thankful!!! I have searched everywere and no luck .The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946. This show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned.The shows today dont have that.The whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them So since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do!!!

"I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. First, I'm going to say that it looks great. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer. I just wish the movie had been as good as it looks. I would not call this a horror movie. Putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie. There's no mystery, there's no suspense, you know who did it the entire time. <br /><br />It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides the entire movie. The acting was okay, I guess, but nothing special.<br /><br />And the tagline, ""Revenge can be deadly""....really?...they should have check how many hundreds of horror/thriller movies have that exact same tagline?<br /><br />It pains me to say some of this, but I know a lot of the people who worked on this movie, and I know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass, so I give my honest opinion.",0,i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago  first  im going to say that it looks great  cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer  i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks  i would not call this a horror movie  putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie  theres no mystery  theres no suspense  you know who did it the entire time   its a drama  you know whats going on with both sides the entire movie  the acting was okay  i guess  but nothing special  and the tagline   revenge can be deadly     really    they should have check how many hundreds of horror thriller movies have that exact same tagline  it pains me to say some of this  but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie  and i know they dont want people blowing smoke up their ass  so i give my honest opinion 
"Certainly not horrible, but definitely not good.<br /><br />Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris.<br /><br />The film is about pre-Apartheid South Africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. The rich farmer/landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a fighter for black rights, was the one killed by Kumalo's son. In this they connect.<br /><br />I cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, for I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars for I have also not seen it; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it, like it actually is trying to say something where the film Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going. Very ""Wishy-washy"". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I did enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie blew. Well, I guess it wasn't that bad, --Five-out-of-ten, -- but it wasn't that good either. Both of the leads, both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also oddly off is game with this film, having also written the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia). Among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or suspensefully. The music doesn't help. The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. One upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much.<br /><br />The last, striking words of Alan Paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. It is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. I don't know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.",0,certainly not horrible  but definitely not good  cry  the beloved country  1995  was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood  adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton   starring james earl jones and richard harris  the film is about pre apartheid south africa  and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining  the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo  james earl jones  receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately  he later finds that his son has killed a man  the rich farmer landowner james jarvis  richard harris  finds that his son  a fighter for black rights  was the one killed by kumalos son  in this they connect  i cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name  for i have not seen it  or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it  both look better than this one  but cry freedom  on the other hand  i have seen  it has a much more urgent air to it  like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry  the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going  very  wishy washy   i refuse to compare the film to the novel  except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film  because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means  frankly  this movie blew  well  i guess it wasnt that bad    five out of ten     but it wasnt that good either  both of the leads  both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history  but that can be blamed on he screenwriter  ronald harwood  who is also oddly off is game with this film  having also written the sublime the pianist  and being julia   among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time  there is little  if any  tension with any moment of the film  racially or suspensefully  the music doesnt help  the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film  one upside is the cinematography  with many rather good or great shots  but unfortunately  this does not help the film too much  the last  striking words of alan patons novel are displayed in the last moments of the film  it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown  i dont know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film  thanks for your time

This one. So we start watching it. First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod! Second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man! Third, none of the dialogue makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe the director (and my next door neighbor) are in need of psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast. It's so amateurish it's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook.... with zombies.

"Jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing. It's like watching a no frills music video today.<br /><br />The jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street.

"A huge hit upon release with Australian audiences, it can still be funny today, but its over-the-top political incorrectness and blunt, unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer. It goes on far too long; some of<br /><br /> the content could have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, which desperately needed some new stuff anyway. Granted, his ocker Aussie attitude is funny, but also becomes annoying as the film drags on. Some say Crocker's songs are the best bits, and they are certainly original, but ""hilarious""? The Adventures of Barry McKenzie will go down as a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, for that matter, Mick Dundees!).

"There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.<br /><br />As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?<br /><br />Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.<br /><br />Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.<br /><br />Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.<br /><br />Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.<br /><br />Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed!

"it's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are not self-contained (if you compare to f.e. coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or however you wanna call it) but well, most stories are really good, some are great and overall it's one of the best movies this year for sure!<br /><br />annoying, that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum, i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start analyzing the single sequences...<br /><br />well, i think that's it!",1,its a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone  but there are 2 minus points    the level of the stories has a large spectrum  some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring    a lot of stories are not self contained  if you compare to f e  coffee and cigarettes  where each story has a point  a message  a punchline or however you wanna call it  but well  most stories are really good  some are great and overall its one of the best movies this year for sure  annoying  that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum  i havent got more to say and i dont want to start analyzing the single sequences    well  i think thats it 
"Everyone knows about this ''Zero Day'' event. What I think this movie did that Elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their life for about a year. Throughout the movie we get to like them, to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do. And THAT gives me the chills. Cause I felt guilty to be cheered by their comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even though I KNEW what was gonna happen you know? Even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 I thought this was funny but still I was horrified to see their heads blown off. Of course I was. I got to like them. They were wicked, maybe, but I felt like they were really normal guys, that they didn't really realize it. But I knew they were.<br /><br />That's, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone, can be planning something crazy, and that we won't even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can't go to sleep right now. There's still this little feeling in my stomach.

"I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description.

"*** REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I'll make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edison's Police Force. LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault Tactics). He's teamed with an ""on-the-edge"" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs. I don't want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.<br /><br />You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance are pretty lackluster. The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott. He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me. LL Cool J is terrible in this film. He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film. The ending is far from satisfying.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film.

"What a wonderful, fanciful movie ""Stardust"" is.<br /><br />I could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say, one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it.<br /><br />At a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats, ""Stardust"" makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. Ironically, ""Stardust"" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for.<br /><br />""Stardust"" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. It has the damsel in distress, the hero, the rogues, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, charms, and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern.<br /><br />""Stardust"" is about a man from the town of Wall, which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom. The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by David Kelly). One day a young man from Wall named Ben Barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech. He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una. She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is away, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy.<br /><br />The boy, named Tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man (Charlie Cox) who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another. Nevertheless, the young lady (named Victoria and played Sienna Miller) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love to her. After they espy a falling star, she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her. He agrees and sets out on his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall.<br /><br />Meanwhile in the kingdom of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne. His sons' names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus, and Septimus. The other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne.<br /><br />Anyway, he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and Voila, that what brings the star to earth.<br /><br />The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she, of course, is wearing the charm. But little does she know she is now being persuaded by Tristain, the Princes, and also an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth.<br /><br />Complicated? Yes. But it all comes together as the adventure unfolds.<br /><br />Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and Yvaine. His initial interest lie only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But he must get past the princes and Lamia first. The princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - never has death been so funny. <br /><br />But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro.<br /><br />His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it to a tee. He steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter. Though his role is small in length, DeNiro is extraordinary!<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed Yvaine. She makes a perfect damsel.

"I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college. I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a ""good Catholic"" in the church's eyes because I don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.<br /><br />So back to the movie...its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God.

"This show had a lot of hype but I didn't know about it until the midseason (season 1). Someone even recommended the show to me. But I decided that if I was going to watch it, I was going to wait until the end of the season so I could watch it in bulk. Due to the show's format, I'm happy I waited. I imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story.<br /><br />Somehow, this show has managed to throw in too much sex. Jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves. Right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed, he's in bed with another woman the next night! Then Tara and Sam get it on, despite each of them knowing that Sam is in love with Sookie. And for some reason, Sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it--even though she's sleeping with a vampire. One of the problems with the show, is that it doesn't do a good job of making you care about the characters. I really didn't care for Jason at all. Along with his endless pursuit of tale, he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him. After a few episodes, I wouldn't have minded if he got killed somehow. For that reason, I was for the most part uninterested in the murders until Sookie's Grandmother became a victim (since the first two were more closely involved with Jason).<br /><br />Then once Sookie and Bill have sex, the story gets a few more subplots. Tara's mother wants an exorcism, then the exorcist lady tries to convince Tara that she should have one to remove her own demon. I wasn't so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as I know there are some people who really believe in that stuff. However, they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after Tara spends about $1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother. At other points, some of the developments happen too fast. Jason continues being a jerk, trying to sell his Grandmother's stuff to buy vampire blood, which apparently is the new crack or something. In his search he finds this girl who will do V (vampire blood) with him. They get high, and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of V. Another example is when Bill has to go to a vampire tribunal. He's only gone for two days before Sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks ""vampire politics"" are more important than her.<br /><br />Subtlety is not this show's strong suit. It doesn't take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog. Although my assumption wasn't dead on, it wasn't that much of a surprise. But the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn't possibly figure the out for yourself. When Tara gets into the car accident, the naked lady's face with the pig is clearly shown, and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout. As if that wasn't enough, they later show the lady again with the pig at her house. Then it's time to wrap up the murder story. At the end of the penultimate episode, it's revealed that Renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer. In the final episode, they shove Renee being the killer in your face. Sookie remarks that it's odd that Renee's thoughts don't have an accent. I thought that was fine, as it adds to Renee being a fraud. But the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against Renee. They show that Renee has the tape of Maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of Renee's boxes about how to fake a Cajun accent. At this point it was just ridiculous. I mean WE GET IT!!! So blah blah blah stuff happens. Bill almost kills himself while failing to save Sookie, who still manages to kill Renee. They start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues. The naked pig lady and Sam have a history, Lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed. Jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti-vampire church--which makes me care about him even less.<br /><br />It's almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show. I think I just expected this show to be better. I'm interested in seeing what happens in season 2, but if I watch it, I'll most likely wait for the season completion.",0,this show had a lot of hype but i didnt know about it until the midseason  season 1   someone even recommended the show to me  but i decided that if i was going to watch it  i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk  due to the shows format  im happy i waited  i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story  somehow  this show has managed to throw in too much sex  jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves  right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed  hes in bed with another woman the next night  then tara and sam get it on  despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie  and for some reason  sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it  even though shes sleeping with a vampire  one of the problems with the show  is that it doesnt do a good job of making you care about the characters  i really didnt care for jason at all  along with his endless pursuit of tale  he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him  after a few episodes  i wouldnt have minded if he got killed somehow  for that reason  i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookies grandmother became a victim  since the first two were more closely involved with jason   then once sookie and bill have sex  the story gets a few more subplots  taras mother wants an exorcism  then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon  i wasnt so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff  however  they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about  1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother  at other points  some of the developments happen too fast  jason continues being a jerk  trying to sell his grandmothers stuff to buy vampire blood  which apparently is the new crack or something  in his search he finds this girl who will do v  vampire blood  with him  they get high  and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v  another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal  hes only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks  vampire politics  are more important than her  subtlety is not this shows strong suit  it doesnt take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog  although my assumption wasnt dead on  it wasnt that much of a surprise  but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldnt possibly figure the out for yourself  when tara gets into the car accident  the naked ladys face with the pig is clearly shown  and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout  as if that wasnt enough  they later show the lady again with the pig at her house  then its time to wrap up the murder story  at the end of the penultimate episode  its revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer  in the final episode  they shove renee being the killer in your face  sookie remarks that its odd that renees thoughts dont have an accent  i thought that was fine  as it adds to renee being a fraud  but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee  they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of renees boxes about how to fake a cajun accent  at this point it was just ridiculous  i mean we get it    so blah blah blah stuff happens  bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie  who still manages to kill renee  they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues  the naked pig lady and sam have a history  lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed  jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti vampire church  which makes me care about him even less  its almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show  i think i just expected this show to be better  im interested in seeing what happens in season 2  but if i watch it  ill most likely wait for the season completion 
"The Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is pretty far down on the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after World War I, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions. And he succeeds, at least at first. A love triangle complicates the story some.<br /><br />This really was a tedious movie, with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren't. The dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable (not the zombie part of it but parts related to the ""romance""). And while I am not any student or expert on cinematography, the camera work didn't seem to help the film much either.<br /><br />While I have seen a few movies that are worse, this is unlikely to please anyone. It's bad, and NOT in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way.",0,the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie ive ever seen  but it is pretty far down on the list  when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i  one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions  and he succeeds  at least at first  a love triangle complicates the story some  this really was a tedious movie  with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who werent  the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable  not the zombie part of it but parts related to the  romance    and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography  the camera work didnt seem to help the film much either  while i have seen a few movies that are worse  this is unlikely to please anyone  its bad  and not in a so bad that it is good kind of way 
"When a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash, his spinster twin sister, Martha Craig (Madge Kennedy), doesn't believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive (even though self-snuff runs in the family) but his three beautiful daughters couldn't care less. The pilot, Jim Norton (John Bromfield), goes to work for Valerie Craig (Kathleen Hughes) who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister, Lorna (Sara Shane) and the family lawyer (Jess Barker). Valerie wants Norton to seduce Lorna when he's not fending off the advances of another sister, the nymphet Vicki (Marla English), but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when Norton falls for his prey. All bets are off as a world of woe -including corporate chicanery, seductions, suicides, blackmail, a murder plot, the Mann Act, double-crosses, disfigurement, and poetic justice- befall ""Craig Manor"", an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea...<br /><br />This preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for WRITTEN ON THE WIND, also from 1956. Douglas Sirk's saga of a powerful (and powerfully dysfunctional) oil clan was said to have inspired the 1980s night-time TV serial DALLAS but the Craig's low-brow excursion into insanity seems right out of it's sinful sister-soap, DYNASTY. All three siblings (only one of whom is really bad) are great beauties but it's Kathleen Hughes' cartoon villainy that stands out. Valerie is relentless in her quest to inherit the family fortune and her unbridled enthusiasm for evil is one of the movie's many guilty pleasures. Teenage sister Vicki is quite a piece of work as well, reminiscent of Carmen Sternwood in THE BIG SLEEP. When they first meet, she pulls the equivalent of trying to sit on Norton's lap while he's still standing by coming on to him with the line ""I graduated summa cum laude from Embrace-able U."" Whew!<br /><br />THREE BAD SISTERS, produced by schlockmeister Howard W. Koch, is a terrific trash-wallow in exploitation excess and the cast is B-Movie Heaven: Marla ""She Creature"" English, 50s hunk John ""Revenge Of The Creature"" Bromfield (once married to French sexpot Corinne Calvet), Universal starlet Sara Shane (discovered by Hedy Lamarr), Jess ""Mr. Susan Hayward"" Barker, Kathleen ""It Came From Outer Space"" Hughes, and former silent screen star Madge Kennedy give it all they've got -however much or little that is. Future Eurotrash star Brett Halsey (TRUMPET OF THE Apocalypse) is seen briefly as one of Vicki's victims.<br /><br />B-Movie rating: 10/10 Marla (and her body English) made marvelous movies!

"So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, a girl see's s ghost. Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does but, oh no, she dies as she does. And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says ""oh no"". The acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big let down.

"If there is a hell, it contains a screening room in which GRAND CANYON is playing over and over again on an eternal loop. One would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help make up for the presences of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity)... But, no. Apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from McDonnell. The entire affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf or know anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is filled with obnoxious, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to like/understand/sympathize with or even tolerate them. With rare exception, they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without.

"This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Worse than the most abhorrent American dross; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea. it's not. It is abject rubbish from very bowels of Satan himself (who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending our tax payers money (lottery money folks) on this piece of nonsense, should be accountable. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline??? I ask you - camp as a Christmas Tree, Deathline ... 'Mind the doors' is classic of really bad British film, we really don't need a reminder. And we certainly don't need a poor, second rate, badly scripted, badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this. All this this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men... I rest my case.<br /><br />Do Not Pay ANY money to see this. It is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash... our cash... for making it. They should hang their heads in shame.<br /><br />I am staggered at the low, low standard of this film. It makes me Mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry whilst idiots are running the show.

"Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into a ""Jack London"" adventure film isn't a bad idea; certainly, he led an interesting, and sometimes adventurous, life. This film, however, winds up flat and unsatisfying. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (as London) has some Londonesque speeches; and, it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive ""The Call of the Wild"" after spending some quality time alone, in the snowy mountains, with his dog, ""Buck"". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very pretty. The film draws unfortunate ""Yellow Peril"" parallels between London's life and World War II, which are both strained and insulting. <br /><br />** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo",0,hollywoods attempt to turn jack londons life into a  jack london  adventure film isnt a bad idea  certainly  he led an interesting  and sometimes adventurous  life  this film  however  winds up flat and unsatisfying  most importantly  it lacks integrity  michael oshea  as london  has some londonesque speeches  and  its nice to see his bearded jack receive  the call of the wild  after spending some quality time alone  in the snowy mountains  with his dog   buck   virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty  the film draws unfortunate  yellow peril  parallels between londons life and world war ii  which are both strained and insulting      jack london  11 24 43  alfred santell   michael oshea  susan hayward  virginia mayo

"Keeping all political views aside, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's 'Gandhi, My Father' is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused-towards-family side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and the fight of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with the society, his larger-than-life father, and most importantly demons in his head. One draws parallels to Gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their father<br /><br />The acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna-strictly in that order- add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of Harilal who weeps to be hugged just once and also runs away at the faintest touch of the finger.<br /><br />Feroz Khan's direction and the production canvas is lavish and attractive, however, the screenplay could've been tighter. I had seen the play some years ago on a pirated video type DVD (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and it was certainly more gripping. Though, the movie's background score and the father-son and mother-son moments are just a brilliant treat.<br /><br />This movie could have been great. It's borderline to that. It has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just Gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions, nothing comes to you.<br /><br />It compares decently to other Gandhi's.

"I wouldn't say this is a *bad* movie. Unfortunately for me, I get the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic. I've been fencing since i was 14 years old, and this movie portrays it very poorly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and appears to have some fencing background), but most of the other actors--especially the students--just seem to be lost.",0,i wouldnt say this is a  bad  movie  unfortunately for me  i get the feeling that the more you know about fencing  the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic  ive been fencing since i was 14 years old  and this movie portrays it very poorly  f  murray abraham is good  and appears to have some fencing background   but most of the other actors  especially the students  just seem to be lost

"An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930's. Audiences must've been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Quite a contrast from his ""Public Enemy"" 2 years earlier. Cagney does add spark & interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline & plot. But the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back. First with the conservative ""Honeymoon Hotel"" number,then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling ""By A Waterfall"" sequence,followed by the closing ""Shanghai Lil"" sequence, Cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with Ruby Keeler. The ""Shanghai Lil"" number with Cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown & anti climactic after the more exciting & incredibly mind boggling ""By A Waterfall"" choreography.If I was the director I would've inserted the ""Shanghai Lil"" number in the middle & close with ""By A Waterfall"",which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak & in my view the best of the 3 numbers. The 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake & James Cagney's performance is added decoration to the cake.

"A wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16-year old ingenue! No exaggeration - that's the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This TV mini-series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one I refer to whenever the topic comes up.<br /><br />That alone makes this completely unwatchable, despite the fact it's one of the best filmed WWII 'global' dramas TV has ever produced. If you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /><br />I'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story (pun intended). Did they watch the film with their eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their ""selective memories"" and ""selective vision"". I'm a Boomer myself so don't think for a second I'm some hubristic young punk. 45 WILL ALWAYS LOOK 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damnit.<br /><br />The Winds Of War could have been... so good. How much more would we be talking about this mini-series today, some 25 years later, had an ACTUAL ingenue been cast in such an important & critical role?

"A French film Ester Williams would love. But the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris exurbia finding themselves. No question where Sciamma's sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as ""animaux"" but actually only the 3 girls are in focus, and for the entire time, with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background. Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on Floriane ( a Renascence quality beauty per one reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience to Anna: not unattractive, but for her, the time of her body's perfection was short, and now she is an adolescent in a women's body. What ensues is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un-natural: where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth? While the dénouement was breath taking, with Floriane's self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, it all seemed abstract, Sciamma's puppets.",1,a french film ester williams would love  but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves  no question where sciammas sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as  animaux  but actually only the 3 girls are in focus  and for the entire time  with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background  marie is a stick of a girl  unattractive  but determined  she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane   a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer  and she is also a friend of convenience to anna  not unattractive  but for her  the time of her bodys perfection was short  and now she is an adolescent in a womens body  what ensues is a journey to self realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un natural  where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth  while the dénouement was breath taking  with florianes self absorption beautifully portrayed  as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne  it all seemed abstract  sciammas puppets 
"Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors this country ever had, showed he was equally at home with movies. With ""Panic in the Streets"", Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his master piece, ""On the Waterfront"", although both movies share only the water setting, for they are different visions about different subjects.<br /><br />Mr. Kazan shot on location in New Orleans. The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories that are the basis of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting ""The Big Easy"". One of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald that shows New Orleans at its best. Also the music by Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch.<br /><br />This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country.<br /><br />One thing comes clear in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, smolders the screen every time one sees him. He was so intense! At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who unknown to him, is stricken with a fatal disease. Blackie, comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon. Notable also, was the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real.<br /><br />The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, as the wife, sounds as though she's a suburban woman from Connecticut.<br /><br />The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr. Kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie.",1,elia kazan  one of the best theater directors this country ever had  showed he was equally at home with movies  with  panic in the streets   mr  kazan gives us an early version of what would come later  with perhaps his master piece   on the waterfront   although both movies share only the water setting  for they are different visions about different subjects  mr  kazan shot on location in new orleans  the adaptation by daniel fuchs of the edna and edward anhalt stories that are the basis of the film  is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting  the big easy   one of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best  also the music by alfred newman and the song by billie holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch  this film  could have been shot in new york  or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like  broklynese  than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country  one thing comes clear in the movie  jack palance  making his screen debut  smolders the screen every time one sees him  he was so intense  at the same time  this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner  who unknown to him  is stricken with a fatal disease  blackie  comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying mans greasy hair with abandon  notable also  was the fact that mr  palance and mr  mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts  something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real  the film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film  we see a family man painting furniture with his young son  later he and the wife discuss how it appears they cant make ends meet with his salary  something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis  richard widmark  playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people  barbara bel geddes  as the wife  sounds as though shes a suburban woman from connecticut  the film is enjoyable thanks to mr  kazans direction and the excellent cast working in the movie 
"The character of Tarzan has been subjected to so many clichés, and so many bad interpretations, that those who are hoping for a different kind of version (people like me, I mean, who liked the Tarzan books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little) ought to know how the recent renditions stack up. Some of the IMDb reviews address this point, but here's my $.02<br /><br />I am aware of only two--count 'em--cinema depictions of Tarzan, namely Greystoke with Christopher Lambert and the Disney animated version, that try to depict Edgar Rice Burrough's rather interesting character (the son of a marooned English noble couple, picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves, and who becomes ""lord of the jungle"" because of his superior human intellect before making it back to England and claiming his other identity) rather than the usual Hollywood jungle-man whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell, his mysterious inability to speak proper English despite long exposure to people who know the language, his habit of swinging on vines, his strength, heroism, etc. About the only thing these two characters have in common are the name Tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named Jane. Ron Ely's TV version is something of a compromise: Like Burroughs' character, he speaks good English and is adept and suave in both cultures in a sort of JamesBondish way, but he's no Lord Greystoke and there's no Jane.<br /><br />Well, this film is in a third category of Tarzan films, and I hope it remains a category of one because it's awful. This category uses the character as a vehicle for, of all things, soft porn. Jane, played by legendarily bad actress Bo Derek is in Africa looking for her dad the absent-minded professor who is combing the jungle looking for something which is never specified. Though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time, she finds him effortlessly. Richard Harris as the dad is the best thing here; he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and hamming in a way that reminds me of Peter O'Toole's deliberately silly performance in What's New Pussycat. Dad explains the legend of Tarzan (""some sort of ghost or spirit"" he says--either a steal from, or an inartistic attempt at homage to, King Kong) to his daughter, who is at this point unfamiliar with the ape-man. Shortly afterward, we hear the infamous cliché of the Tarzan yell. Dad dies, which oddly doesn't seem to faze his devoted daughter very much. And then.....<br /><br />Then Tarzan appears, but says nothing. Indeed, he says nothing during the entire film. He and Jane fall in love, and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she recites doggerel love-poetry off-screen. The End. That's the plot. <br /><br />Well, not exactly; there's also a scene where Tarzan wrestles unrealistically with a boa constrictor--a most unusual boa, since it's the only poisonous one ever seen. Jane treats the bite with the aid of a chimp who helps by wringing out the garment she tears off to bind the wound with (I'm not making this up!), and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off.<br /><br />I always like to conclude a review by saying something positive, but this time it's hard. Let's see... well, it's unfair to criticize this film for featuring an orangutan, even though we all know orangutans don't live in Africa; after all, the classic Tarzan movies all used Indian elephants, did they not? Also, you have to admit that Bo Derek is pretty in face and form. (But in that case why the hell didn't she just make a career as an art model? What does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman? I actually haven't decided whether it's a positive or a negative that they never showed her crotch.) But now I realize: try as I may, I can't end on a positive note. <br /><br />See this film if you're a bad film buff. I'm outa here.",0,the character of tarzan has been subjected to so many clichés  and so many bad interpretations  that those who are hoping for a different kind of version  people like me  i mean  who liked the tarzan books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little  ought to know how the recent renditions stack up  some of the imdb reviews address this point  but heres my   02 i am aware of only two  count em  cinema depictions of tarzan  namely greystoke with christopher lambert and the disney animated version  that try to depict edgar rice burroughs rather interesting character  the son of a marooned english noble couple  picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves  and who becomes  lord of the jungle  because of his superior human intellect before making it back to england and claiming his other identity  rather than the usual hollywood jungle man whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell  his mysterious inability to speak proper english despite long exposure to people who know the language  his habit of swinging on vines  his strength  heroism  etc  about the only thing these two characters have in common are the name tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named jane  ron elys tv version is something of a compromise  like burroughs character  he speaks good english and is adept and suave in both cultures in a sort of jamesbondish way  but hes no lord greystoke and theres no jane  well  this film is in a third category of tarzan films  and i hope it remains a category of one because its awful  this category uses the character as a vehicle for  of all things  soft porn  jane  played by legendarily bad actress bo derek is in africa looking for her dad the absent minded professor who is combing the jungle looking for something which is never specified  though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time  she finds him effortlessly  richard harris as the dad is the best thing here  he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and hamming in a way that reminds me of peter otooles deliberately silly performance in whats new pussycat  dad explains the legend of tarzan   some sort of ghost or spirit  he says  either a steal from  or an inartistic attempt at homage to  king kong  to his daughter  who is at this point unfamiliar with the ape man  shortly afterward  we hear the infamous cliché of the tarzan yell  dad dies  which oddly doesnt seem to faze his devoted daughter very much  and then      then tarzan appears  but says nothing  indeed  he says nothing during the entire film  he and jane fall in love  and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she recites doggerel love poetry off screen  the end  thats the plot   well  not exactly  theres also a scene where tarzan wrestles unrealistically with a boa constrictor  a most unusual boa  since its the only poisonous one ever seen  jane treats the bite with the aid of a chimp who helps by wringing out the garment she tears off to bind the wound with  im not making this up    and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off  i always like to conclude a review by saying something positive  but this time its hard  lets see    well  its unfair to criticize this film for featuring an orangutan  even though we all know orangutans dont live in africa  after all  the classic tarzan movies all used indian elephants  did they not  also  you have to admit that bo derek is pretty in face and form   but in that case why the hell didnt she just make a career as an art model  what does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman  i actually havent decided whether its a positive or a negative that they never showed her crotch   but now i realize  try as i may  i cant end on a positive note   see this film if youre a bad film buff  im outa here 
"The Rookie suffers from so much. There are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie, the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt just don't know when to quit. It takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. Then the guys start playing Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. It is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt are playing the stupid, stereotyped Japanese guys. But, it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters. Then it just abruptly ends. Even a naked Julie Newmar in a towel can't save this one.<br /><br />There is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long. The story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing. Stick to Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that animated face.",0,the rookie suffers from so much  there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie  the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush  noonan and leavitt just dont know when to quit  it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked  then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day  it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid  stereotyped japanese guys  but  it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters  then it just abruptly ends  even a naked julie newmar in a towel cant save this one  there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long  the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing  stick to martin   lewis  at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face 
"First of all I need to say that I'm Portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching Portuguese movies, probably one each year or even none...<br /><br />...And the reason is the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese people that the national pictures are awful, really close to the worst ever made! However, in the last decade, it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when ""Leão da Estrela"" e ""Costa do Castelo"" were among the worlds best of their time, with movies like ""Pulsação Zero"" or ""Sorte Nula"", both from director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and music in common.<br /><br />This one is also good, not of the same kind because it isn't a true comedy; in fact it's officially a drama, a woman's drama the has some unexpected funny parts, cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them, like the hypothetical travel to the Caribbean just to get laid. <br /><br />The plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are fine, the locations regular as the score; but the truth is that it all make sense, then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema, that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix.<br /><br />If you want to watch a Portuguese movie, surely you can take better option, but it stills one to be measured.",1,first of all i need to say that im portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies  probably one each year or even none       and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful  really close to the worst ever made  however  in the last decade  it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when  leão da estrela  e  costa do castelo  were among the worlds best of their time  with movies like  pulsação zero  or  sorte nula   both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common  this one is also good  not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy  in fact its officially a drama  a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts  cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them  like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid   the plot works and can surprise us a few times  the actors are fine  the locations regular as the score  but the truth is that it all make sense  then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema  that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix  if you want to watch a portuguese movie  surely you can take better option  but it stills one to be measured 
"""The Screaming Skull"" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. But then again, when I first saw ""House on Haunted Hill"" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. But there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />In it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the Whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958!

"Alain Resnais films are uncanny in the way that they aren't really edited for continuity, but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited. Love unto Death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie, and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the Eros/Thanatos relationship... or perhaps creates a new relationship, that of Agape/Thanatos.<br /><br />The beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie. A woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed--did she kill him, or what happened? Soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead, but from there a newer, stranger drama begins: the man wakes up, and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love, faith, and devotion.<br /><br />Resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work, and what's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work. In this case, Resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score, which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story. Trapped in this elegiac aside periodically, the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem, and I got strange flashbacks to Dante's Divine Comedy from this one, despite the lack of direct reference within the movie. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer, which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections. Memory-narrative, Resnais creates.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB",1,alain resnais films are uncanny in the way that they arent really edited for continuity  but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited  love unto death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie  and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the eros thanatos relationship    or perhaps creates a new relationship  that of agape thanatos  the beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie  a woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed  did she kill him  or what happened  soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead  but from there a newer  stranger drama begins  the man wakes up  and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences  meanwhile  their friends  who are both priests  watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love  faith  and devotion  resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work  and whats so amazing about his films is that those devices always work  in this case  resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score  which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story  trapped in this elegiac aside periodically  the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem  and i got strange flashbacks to dantes divine comedy from this one  despite the lack of direct reference within the movie  resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer  which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections  memory narrative  resnais creates    polarisdib
"Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The ""witty"" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a ""ho""). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this!

"I just watched I. Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with ""Einstein"" playing ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters. I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950's, the time in which this movie is set. (I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please don't think I am some staunch women's libber.) It's wonderful how a man who is ""only a grease monkey"" is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. There are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.<br /><br />I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters is to speak at symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge. In the next camera shot, there only 2. In the credits on our video, it lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that, what a great cast is assembled here.

"Especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed (1973), this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong. Too many people, and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. It's set in New York in 2022 (I think), and it reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta.<br /><br />I got to appreciate Charlton Heston's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (maybe is) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here, he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt (taking rare food treats from the rich), and being totally corrupt (actively condoning evil). <br /><br />The movie all seems to take place at night, and sweat is dripping off everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Even though I hadn't seen it before, I knew the famous ending (which will not here be revealed), but the ending is certainly foreshadowed.<br /><br />Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: going to the council (made up of elderly Jews with heavy accents, so it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then going off to the Thanatopsis to check out.<br /><br />Gritty, pre-Star Wars dystopian science fiction.",1,especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed  1973   this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong  too many people  and nothing works  the only people who can live in comfort are the rich  its set in new york in 2022  i think   and it reminds you of your worst vision of calcutta  i got to appreciate charlton hestons acting after seeing him in orson welles touch of evil  he was  maybe is  capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi heroic people  here  he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt  taking rare food treats from the rich   and being totally corrupt  actively condoning evil    the movie all seems to take place at night  and sweat is dripping off everyone  except in one of the rare air conditioned apartments  even though i hadnt seen it before  i knew the famous ending  which will not here be revealed   but the ending is certainly foreshadowed  great scenes with edward g  robinson  going to the council  made up of elderly jews with heavy accents  so it seems   where the truth is revealed  and then going off to the thanatopsis to check out  gritty  pre star wars dystopian science fiction 
"The script was VERY weak w/o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them. The script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced. The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them talk this very muted, stiff dialogue. On a technical note, the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times. Then again, this could be called a blessing. Overall, this same story could have better been told in a short film w/ a running time under 30 minutes. The obvious ""in your face"" homages to Sam Raimi and ""Evil Dead"" would have been good had they been more subtle, but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off. C'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best that could be done?

"An interesting look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne as America's first consul to Japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period.

"In reflecting on this movie I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One relatively forgettable but covering the same geography, is Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of Indochine, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects.<br /><br />I was struck with the dignity of Potee, with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck with the love/hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force, it is the latter that links this movie to Indochine.<br /><br />One never is sure what motivates everyone, though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the more scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships.<br /><br />The American black who gives the grown up France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He was coming home, but they just thought him to be a little daft. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was.<br /><br />",1,in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective  one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography  is coup de torchon  the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine  claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine  the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects  i was struck with the dignity of potee  with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses  i was also struck with the love hate relationship between him and aimee  it is the latter that gives the film its driving force  it is the latter that links this movie to indochine  one never is sure what motivates everyone  though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism  it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon  theirs is the more scandalous story  perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way  but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships  the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa  he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother  he was coming home  but they just thought him to be a little daft  france  the character and the girl  grew up in cameroon  but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was 
"Vodka Lemon is a charming, yet extremely uneven Arminian film that will delight some and bore others. Though reasonably well-crafted, the film lacks any real ""zing"", relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art-house viewer. The film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled. You may laugh, but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. A noble effort, ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion.",0,vodka lemon is a charming  yet extremely uneven arminian film that will delight some and bore others  though reasonably well crafted  the film lacks any real  zing   relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art house viewer  the film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance  unfortunately  they deserve a film worthy of their genius  too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama  vodka lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled  you may laugh  but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides  a noble effort  ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion 
"I just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet. These other reviewers aren't joking around, this really IS the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see. When the movie started I couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.<br /><br />They're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. It really does. Like the ""director"" took the family hi8 camcorder (before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. No script, just making it up as he went along.<br /><br />When I watched it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). At first I thought I'd hooked it up wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better, you know. But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.<br /><br />As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this.

"This film (along with Rinne) are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF ""HorrorFest."" And, yes, that's faint praise indeed. 'Cause there's not much worse in filmdom than would-be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot.<br /><br />And that's all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head. Sure, it would have been nice if he'd transfered it to film, but this happened instead.

"After finally watching Walt Disney's Song of the South on myspace, I decided to watch Ralph Bakshi's response to that movie-Coonskin-on Afro Video which I linked from Google Video. In this one, during the live-action sequences, Preacherman (Charles Gordone) takes his friend Sampson (Barry White) with him to pick up Pappy (Scatman Crothers) and Randy (Philip Thomas, years before he added Michael for his middle name professionally) as the latter two escape from prison. During their attempt, Pappy tells Randy a tale of Brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (White), and Preacher Fox (Gordone) and their adventures in Harlem. As expected in many of these Bakshi efforts, there's a mix of animation and live-action that provides a unique point-of-view from the writer/director that is sure to offend some people. Another fascinating animated character is Miss America who's a big-as in gigantic in every way-white blonde woman dressed in skin-tight red, white, and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me! There are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning Brother Bear's frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me. There's also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a ""cockroach"" she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist George Herriman. I was also fascinated hearing Grover Washington Jr.'s version of ""Ain't No Sunshine"" heard as part of the score. Most compelling part of the picture was seeing the Scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the N-word in a satirical way. When I saw a VHS cover of this movie years ago, it had depicted Brother Rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the Warner circles with the slogan, ""This movie will offend EVERYBODY"". That is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children. That said, I definitely recommend Coonskin to fans of Bakshi and of every form of animation.",1,after finally watching walt disneys song of the south on myspace  i decided to watch ralph bakshis response to that movie coonskin on afro video which i linked from google video  in this one  during the live action sequences  preacherman  charles gordone  takes his friend sampson  barry white  with him to pick up pappy  scatman crothers  and randy  philip thomas  years before he added michael for his middle name professionally  as the latter two escape from prison  during their attempt  pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit  voice of thomas   brother bear  white   and preacher fox  gordone  and their adventures in harlem  as expected in many of these bakshi efforts  theres a mix of animation and live action that provides a unique point of view from the writer director that is sure to offend some people  another fascinating animated character is miss america whos a big as in gigantic in every way white blonde woman dressed in skin tight red  white  and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me  there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bears frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me  theres also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a  cockroach  she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman  i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jr s version of  aint no sunshine  heard as part of the score  most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the n word in a satirical way  when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago  it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan   this movie will offend everybody   that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children  that said  i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation

"""Wisecracker,"" the biography of actor William Haines, offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies. The old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films, but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a Los Angeles museum screening of SHOW PEOPLE, the late silent feature in which he co-starred with Marion Davies. Beforehand, Haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter, but he was pleasantly surprised (and no doubt relieved) at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it. Watch the film today and you can see why: SHOW PEOPLE is a delightful Hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair, yet without malice. It's still funny and its satirical points still resonate. Needless to say, the technology of movie-making has changed vastly since the silent days, but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven't changed all that much.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE also stands as the best surviving work of Marion Davies, a first-rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes. Where her career was concerned Davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour, the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. It's well known that Hearst exerted enormous influence over Davies' choice of roles, and well known too that, despite her gift for comedy, he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas. By the late '20s, for whatever reason, Marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies (including THE RED MILL and THE PATSY), but SHOW PEOPLE, directed by the great King Vidor, stands as her most enjoyable showcase. William Haines gives an engaging, likable performance as her boyfriend and co-star Billy Boone, but this is the leading lady's show all the way.<br /><br />Marion plays Southern belle Peggy Pepper, an aspiring actress who storms Hollywood accompanied by her father, determined to become a movie star. (Her dad Colonel Pepper is played by actor/director Dell Henderson, a veteran of Griffith's Biograph dramas whocoincidentally?resembled Hearst!) One of Marion's funniest bits, often excerpted elsewhere, is her audition at the Comet Studio casting office. While Dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray (""Sorrow! . . . Joy!"") and drops a handkerchief across her face, Peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture. She's hired, only to discover that Comet makes low-brow comedies, the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue. Of course, Comet is intended as a take-off of Mack Sennett's Keystone, but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds. As Peggy Pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves Comet for the more prestigious High Art Studio, assuming the name ""Patricia Peppoire"" as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress. At some point it may occur to us (as it surely did to viewers in 1928) that Davies' rival Gloria Swanson started out in Keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for Cecil B. DeMille. And as Miss Peppoire takes herself more and more seriously, giving the high-hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic Billy Boone, Davies' performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at Swanson herself. This is especially notable during an interview sequence, when Miss Peppoire's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot-on impersonation of Swanson. I suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof, but I have to wonder how friendly relations were between Gloria and Marion after this movie was released.<br /><br />In any event, SHOW PEOPLE is a delicious treat for buffs, who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout. Charlie Chaplin contributes a nice bit, sans makeup and looking quite distinguished, eagerly seeking Patricia Peppoire's autograph! (And in a show of good sportsmanship Marion Davies herself puts in a self-mocking cameo appearance, evening the score for poking fun at Swanson by poking fun at herself.) This is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate, at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business. SHOW PEOPLE surely belongs in the company of such classics as SUNSET BOULEVARD and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, among Hollywood's most expertly produced, enjoyable exercises in amused self-examination.",1, wisecracker   the biography of actor william haines  offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies  the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films  but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people  the late silent feature in which he co starred with marion davies  beforehand  haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter  but he was pleasantly surprised  and no doubt relieved  at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it  watch the film today and you can see why  show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair  yet without malice  its still funny and its satirical points still resonate  needless to say  the technology of movie making has changed vastly since the silent days  but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves havent changed all that much  show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies  a first rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes  where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour  the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst  its well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies choice of roles  and well known too that  despite her gift for comedy  he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas  by the late 20s  for whatever reason  marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies  including the red mill and the patsy   but show people  directed by the great king vidor  stands as her most enjoyable showcase  william haines gives an engaging  likable performance as her boyfriend and co star billy boone  but this is the leading ladys show all the way  marion plays southern belle peggy pepper  an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father  determined to become a movie star   her dad colonel pepper is played by actor director dell henderson  a veteran of griffiths biograph dramas whocoincidentally resembled hearst   one of marions funniest bits  often excerpted elsewhere  is her audition at the comet studio casting office  while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray   sorrow        joy    and drops a handkerchief across her face  peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture  shes hired  only to discover that comet makes low brow comedies  the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue  of course  comet is intended as a take off of mack sennetts keystone  but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds  as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio  assuming the name  patricia peppoire  as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress  at some point it may occur to us  as it surely did to viewers in 1928  that davies rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b  demille  and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously  giving the high hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone  davies performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself  this is especially notable during an interview sequence  when miss peppoires spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot on impersonation of swanson  i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof  but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released  in any event  show people is a delicious treat for buffs  who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout  charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit  sans makeup and looking quite distinguished  eagerly seeking patricia peppoires autograph   and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a self mocking cameo appearance  evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself   this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate  at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business  show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin in the rain  among hollywoods most expertly produced  enjoyable exercises in amused self examination

"Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; it features a gloriously happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his Queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the King leaves the scene, his Queen makes music with the palace's Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the King discovers the lovers, he decides to enact a horrific Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). The sets make ""The Sealed Room"" look very staged. The performances are okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /><br />*** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B.

"Evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything. I am not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's B movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse. As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. The English was terribly accented and I think no one could really even speak English they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both ""life-like"" and real.",0,evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything  i am not sure how much john rys daves got  but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a rotten movie  the special effects were worse then effects from the 1950s b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse  as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion  the english was terribly accented and i think no one could really even speak english they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both  life like  and real

"""Gespenster"" Question of to be cool in the German cinema<br /><br />There are not many German films in the last ten years, who have made me so interest. Yes, the problem of the most German films are in this film ""Gespenster"" too. He is on some places to uncooked to be good to see. Special the figure of Toni (Sabine Timento) is too cool. But thats is in German films always so. Everybody must to learns this coolneß - is the realism in this films. Thats difficult to understand. But in this case it makes some sense, because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never love it, because you lose it. Thats not clear for the other girl Nina in this film. She love her - and she would lose her. But Nina lost everything. She will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling. There is no way - but you must take it said Herbert Achterbusch for twenty years. Thats so often the way it goes in German films. Why? Nina (Julia Hummer) is not inside of the laws of society - the is outside - and there she have no chance. This films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside. Thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination. Throw it all away - and go nowhere! But the actress plays this difficult part very interesting. On the other side - there the parents - who are the pendant to the two girls. The have a car - a hotel suite - the have money and live in world with music of the opera. But the film stand always in some distance to seem. There is no much explaining of them.<br /><br />In the center of this film, there is one scene you will never forget. The two girls got to a casting. And there they should say how they find together. In this scene Toni will lying on. She said a fantastic story-has nothing to do with her. And then Nina will say the truth. She said it in an introversion way. There is no exhibition in it. She looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here. Thats a great moment. In the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than Toni goes away...<br /><br />Okay, The film will end - in the German way of coolneß - rubbish - here the circle of sadness is closing.

"The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would say this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story was better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in wonderland, with the wonders about to fade away.<br /><br />P.S. Although it isn't official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes life. It isn't entirely factual, but it's far more enjoyable.",1,the true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs  jewelry  guns  and money  some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids  honestly  this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man  what is the second part of their master plan  once they have his stuff   theyll sit around and get high again  great plan  even if you dont know the story  there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises  the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters  with party scenes and a montage of their loot  is weak and insulting  the story was better off with a more straight forward approach  as it is  this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers  the bigger story  in more ways than one  is john holmes  he is the center of this story anyway  this movie should have been all about him  his life  he was the one in wonderland  with the wonders about to fade away  p s  although it isnt official  boogie nights is a better version of holmes life  it isnt entirely factual  but its far more enjoyable 
"(Avast, slight spoilers ahead) I got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons.<br /><br />I once went to the town of Matewan, West Virginia, and in a little museum there I saw the schedule for the town theatre citra May 1954. Movies would change at the theatre each day. As there would be no TV for another decade or so in those parts, this was much of the available entertainment in the town. ""The Raid"" seems to have been made for towns like Matewan in the 1950's. Although it wasn't listed for that month, I am sure showed there some Monday or Tuesday night for an audience which probably wasn't too demanding. The historical raid - daring and remarkably successful - didn't seem to have been very well researched, so the movie is full of Hollywood embellishments, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice being Liberty Valance. And St. Albans seems to have had more Yankee soldiers coming and going through the town than Washington D.C. had.<br /><br />What really made me snicker was when the raiders change into their Confederate uniforms. Only in tacky Civil War paintings do Rebel uniforms look so pristine. When Anne Bancroft's son catches Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween.<br /><br />And then there's Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie I actually looked on the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The then-studio contract actress looks nothing like in her later films, and has none of the presence she would later have in ""The Miracle Worker,"" ""Agnes of God,"" and of course ""The Graduate.""<br /><br />Worth seeing if only 1). you live in St. Albans and 2). you have a couple hours to kill on a Hollywood fictionalization of your home town's biggest news story.",0, avast  slight spoilers ahead  i got this tape from my local library  which keeps a copy for obvious reasons  i once went to the town of matewan  west virginia  and in a little museum there i saw the schedule for the town theatre citra may 1954  movies would change at the theatre each day  as there would be no tv for another decade or so in those parts  this was much of the available entertainment in the town   the raid  seems to have been made for towns like matewan in the 1950s  although it wasnt listed for that month  i am sure showed there some monday or tuesday night for an audience which probably wasnt too demanding  the historical raid   daring and remarkably successful   didnt seem to have been very well researched  so the movie is full of hollywood embellishments  including a loose cannon played by lee marvin  marvin uses the opportunity to practice being liberty valance  and st  albans seems to have had more yankee soldiers coming and going through the town than washington d c  had  what really made me snicker was when the raiders change into their confederate uniforms  only in tacky civil war paintings do rebel uniforms look so pristine  when anne bancrofts son catches van heflin in his uniform just before the raid  i expected the boy to think it was halloween  and then theres anne bancroft herself  while watching the movie i actually looked on the imdb to see if there was a second anne bancroft  the then studio contract actress looks nothing like in her later films  and has none of the presence she would later have in  the miracle worker    agnes of god   and of course  the graduate   worth seeing if only 1   you live in st  albans and 2   you have a couple hours to kill on a hollywood fictionalization of your home towns biggest news story 
"In fact, these young people were so distasteful that I couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since I considered her the most annoying of the bunch.<br /><br />But I knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen Christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background. It had nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />Even the prosthetics looked fake and the ""blood"" looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch, although later on it took on red day-glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal to that bunch. It sure didn't appeal to me. Blah...<br /><br />And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself. She still looks hot, though. I'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays.<br /><br />However, it is a step up from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) in that it has a somewhat coherent plot, so I'll give it that much. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film.<br /><br />Lion's Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up.<br /><br />2 out of 10",0,in fact  these young people were so distasteful that i couldnt wait for all of em to get slaughtered  and that includes clarissa  joanna canton  since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch  but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background  it had nowhere to go but down  even the prosthetics looked fake and the  blood  looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch  although later on it took on red day glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing  im sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh t since itll appeal to that bunch  it sure didnt appeal to me  blah    and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself  she still looks hot  though  im glad she takes care of herself since we dont get to see too much of her nowadays  however  it is a step up from dante tomasellis meandering horror  2002  in that it has a somewhat coherent plot  so ill give it that much  that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch  i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end  it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film  lions gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up  2 out of 10
"I had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer,the end result was just two scenes in the movie. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the wagon,stop the wagon etc . So this Dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real. (yes Doris, animals were hurt during filming) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in the Shining? A great western/social comment from the 50's. This should be in the same class as High Noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was for 50's youth.",1,i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer the end result was just two scenes in the movie  the location was sylvan lake in the black hills  bring the wagon stop the wagon etc   so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed  the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real   yes doris  animals were hurt during filming  i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining  a great western social comment from the 50s  this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for 50s youth 
"I watched it subtitled as it was in Russian, but really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things. <br /><br />When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle. There was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomached.<br /><br />Not for people who like the regular old Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent films.

"Please, help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The synopsis of the movie is: the First Lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her. That's it. Undetected by anyone, except Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about...and gets away completely free.<br /><br />Some specific points are particularly hilarious: While standing in front of the president, Cuba a deflects the assassin's bullet...which then enters the back of the president's head.<br /><br />Cuba and Angie watch film from a news camera, and they see...a clue. They go to great lengths to protect the film, believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film.<br /><br />Cuba speaks with a presidential staff member.

"Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, ""Hey this looks like fun,"" - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... I cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then cried some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's ""time was up"" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this.

"I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969. After actually seeing it, however, I'm not surprised anymore. It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style, cinematography, and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character.<br /><br />The most amazing thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short movie. I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him. I think when he looks in the mirror he's trying to see if it's really him that has done- or is about to do- something terrible.<br /><br />I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate.

"Ah, the 1970's. A time when it was in to be a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then.<br /><br />Joe Sarno offers up a pretty good soft-core film. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development.<br /><br />It's pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger's movie. Two couples with open relationships re-ignite the wanderlust out of the MILF of one of the women who has come for a visit. Not much more to it.<br /><br />Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles then it is a different story. Not too many 40-somethings look as delicious undressed as Ms. Welles. It's worth the price alone to see Ms. Welles look at herself in the mirror as if she's Aphrodite. She's no ""Stifler's Mom"". She's way sexier.<br /><br />I also digged Chris Jordan's Anna. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be her ""separated at birth"" twin or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism.<br /><br />Unlike 1990's soft-core porn, 70's softie porn retained the hardcore film's realism (something that 2000's soft-core has brought back on occasion, instead of the 90's music and canned orgasms) and it is here in full force. It's not real but it feels real.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed the Quebec produced ""Deux Femmes En Or"", you'll enjoy this one.

"Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.<br /><br />Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. And all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) <br /><br />Ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable ""twist"") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another ""twist.""

"For those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight, I first offer these four words: Don't waste your time! ""Chungking Express"" was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong Burger King. I can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane! It's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that ""tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up""). The same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, wandering, hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature I could have done without. And if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60's ode ""California Dreaming"" by the Mamas and Papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, though I cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. He was known to have remarked, ""I'm happy to love a movie this much."" A lot of us, though, hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.",0,for those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight  i first offer these four words  dont waste your time   chungking express  was shoddily filmed  slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a hong kong burger king  i cant remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane  its an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog  a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that  tears can be dried with a tissue  but water takes time to mop up    the same character is also seen carrying on a deep  meaningful rapport with his towels  soap  stuffed animals  dirty laundry  etc  the shaky  wandering  hand held camera work was another annoying feature i could have done without  and if that isnt enough to make you puke in your popcorn  we hear the old 60s ode  california dreaming  by the mamas and papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence  quentin tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to america through his rolling thunder productions company  though i cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother  he was known to have remarked   im happy to love a movie this much   a lot of us  though  hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future 
"This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube that is. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorcery quest between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the realm of Ice and his mother Queen Juliana, has set their sights on conquest of the known world. When their glaciers destroy's the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the sub-human minions of Nekron and Juliana capture Firekeep's King Jarol's sultry daughter Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape, and eventually meets with Larn, who promises to escort her back to Firekeep; if the sub-humans don't find them first.<br /><br />This movie did very little box office (as did most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but has become a cult classic, partly for the quality of the art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Also, I have heard that the screenplay was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who had done Conan comic book stories, and the background painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; though admittedly I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, noted for his artwork for figurines, music-boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company besides paintings. And like Bakshi's films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this movie was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the former.<br /><br />So overall, I think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made, and an awesome collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With plenty of fantasy, sexual innuendo, and thrilling adventure.",1,this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi  after watching it on youtube that is  set in the distant past after the ice age  it is a prehistoric sword and sorcery quest between good and evil  nekron  lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana  has set their sights on conquest of the known world  when their glaciers destroys the village of a man named larn  he  larn  vows to avenge his people and kill the ice lord  meanwhile  the sub human minions of nekron and juliana capture firekeeps king jarols sultry daughter princess teegra  but she manages to escape  and eventually meets with larn  who promises to escort her back to firekeep  if the sub humans dont find them first  this movie did very little box office  as did most of ralph bakshis films   but has become a cult classic  partly for the quality of the art  a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta  also  i have heard that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas  the two men who had done conan comic book stories  and the background painters included james gurney  the illustrator of the dinotopia novels  though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia  and also the painter thomas kinkade  noted for his artwork for figurines  music boxes for the bradford exchange company besides paintings  and like bakshis films the lord of the rings and american pop  this movie was rotoscoped  but the process works better in this film than in the former  so overall  i think its one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made  and an awesome collaboration between two great minds   ralph bakshi and frank frazetta  with plenty of fantasy  sexual innuendo  and thrilling adventure

"This adaptation, like 1949's *The Heiress*, is based on the Henry James novel. *The Heiress*, starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to James' original story than this new remake, which retains James' original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (Leigh), devoted to her father (Finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man (Chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she's acting through gritted teeth. She's not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly  it's just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, she's not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in *The Truth About Cats and Dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where *Washington Square* differs from *The Heiress*. Another instance is the ability to stick with it. It is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet, offering too little story in too long of a movie.",0,this adaptation  like 1949s  the heiress   is based on the henry james novel   the heiress   starring olivia de havilland  remains as a well respected piece of work  though less true to james original story than this new remake  which retains james original title  it is the story of a awkward  yet loving daughter  leigh   devoted to her father  finney  after her mother dies during childbirth  the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever  and considers her  as well as all women  simpleminded  when a young man  chaplin  of good family and little fortune comes courting  the father is naturally suspicious  but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man  is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him  leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style  like shes acting through gritted teeth  shes not bad in this  and she handles her role relatively deftly  its just an awkward role for any actress  making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses  while the character garners a lot of sympathy  shes not particularly likable  the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin  previously seen in  the truth about cats and dogs   plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune  or is really in love with her  maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well meaning aunt  finney is marvelous  of course  as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience  but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves  but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune  this is only one instance where  washington square  differs from  the heiress   another instance is the ability to stick with it  it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet  offering too little story in too long of a movie 
"Even in the 21st century, child-bearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. That is the theme of ""Life Begins"": a look at the ""difficult cases"" ward of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not germane to the plot) to give birth; she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth. She's in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and pain with each other.<br /><br />Although Loretta Young is the lead, the outstanding performance, as usual, is put in by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's ""B"" women in the 1930s, showing up quite a bit in supporting roles, and sometimes getting the lead in B movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several installments of the ""Torchy"" B-movie series.) Here, Farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children, since they'll only get in the way. She does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including smuggling liquor into the ward (this of course during the Prohibition days), and drinking like a fish -- apparently they'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s.<br /><br />Interestingly, unlike most movie of the early 1930s, it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men -- that situation is reversed, with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly. (Watch for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers.) ""Life Begins"", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama, to be sure, but it's quite a charming little movie. Turner Classic show it, albeit infrequently; I've only seen it show up on a few days honoring Loretta Young. But it's highly recommended viewing when it does show up.",1,even in the 21st century  child bearing is dangerous  women have miscarriages  and give birth prematurely  seventy five years ago  it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth  that is the theme of  life begins   a look at the  difficult cases  ward of a maternity hospital  loretta young plays the lead  a woman brought here from prison  what crime she committed is not germane to the plot  to give birth  shes conflicted about the fact shes going to have to give her baby up after birth  shes in a ward with several other women  who share their joys and pain with each other  although loretta young is the lead  the outstanding performance  as usual  is put in by glenda farrell  farrell was one of warners  b  women in the 1930s  showing up quite a bit in supporting roles  and sometimes getting the lead in b movies  farrell played torchy blane in several installments of the  torchy  b movie series   here  farrell plays an expectant mother who doesnt want her children  since theyll only get in the way  she does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses  including smuggling liquor into the ward  this of course during the prohibition days   and drinking like a fish    apparently theyd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s  interestingly  unlike most movie of the early 1930s  its not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men    that situation is reversed  with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly   watch for veteran character actor frank mchugh as one of the expectant fathers    life begins   being an early talkie  treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama  to be sure  but its quite a charming little movie  turner classic show it  albeit infrequently  ive only seen it show up on a few days honoring loretta young  but its highly recommended viewing when it does show up 
"A remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play, nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie.

The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine which made the first movie so watchable, is replaced with a horrid, brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer.

I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana.<br /><br />I really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and I think it's got a good ending even though I didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings I figured it out over time and that's the important part.

"I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed ""masterpiece"" of the German New Wave: <br /><br />1) There are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?<br /><br />2) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.<br /><br />3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and ""experts"" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. <br /><br />The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. <br /><br />4) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. Unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting.<br /><br />Strangely, for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust, it itself never mentions it once.",0,i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed  masterpiece  of the german new wave   1  there are major flaws in simple exposition  in the basic communication of critical plot points  as relating to marias abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband  how many viewers understood that the husband agreed  in exchange for substantial financial remuneration  not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead  2  the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental  the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswalds will  on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald  in the final version  however  maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide  maria is then summarily blown up  rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self delusion and moral compromise  3  fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private  the political on the personal  contrary to what the critics and  experts  assert  i dont think it works  merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama   the selfish ambition of marias rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so called economic miracle of postwar germany  maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place  but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific  women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self advancement for ages   4  lastly  there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness    fassbinders drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect  unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen  music is clumsily intrusive in places  and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting  strangely  for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust  it itself never mentions it once

"""The Last Wave"" is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind. The title refers to the Aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be one last wave that wipes out everything.<br /><br />David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer hired to defend some Aborigines accused of murder. Around this time, there has been unusually heavy rainfall in Australia. While defending the Aborigines, David learns the last wave theory, and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology.<br /><br />The movie's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one's mind. Peter Weir created a perplexing, but thought-provoking, movie. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in ""Walkabout"", ""Crocodile Dundee"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants.<br /><br />If you get a chance, watch the ""making of"" feature on the DVD.

"Many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie (Gackt, Hyde, and Wang Lee Hom is very famous singer in Japan). But don't judge it before you watch, is what I say. Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. It's a good film with a touchy story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They made it so good until I can't stop watching this all over again. <br /><br />The story has written pretty well but I admit that their act are little disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language (Japan). But, it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie.<br /><br />I think Gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die, When Sho's Brother died, Kei Shoot Son die, and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass away~ even I told that Hyde's skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up at that scene!!<br /><br />There's a time where The plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason Why Son can join the local mafia and being Sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also Son is Sho's brother in law.<br /><br />Whatever, I love this movie~ (very much ^^). <br /><br />This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.",1,many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie  gackt  hyde  and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan   but dont judge it before you watch  is what i say  gackt and staff are very serious when made this film  and they worked so hard  its a good film with a touchy story inside  several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad  they made it so good until i cant stop watching this all over again   the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing  this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language  japan   but  its comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie  i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life  when toshi was killed  when sho asked kei to turn yi che to being vampire like him because he wont let her die  when shos brother died  kei shoot son die  and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away  even i told that hydes skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scene   theres a time where the plot goes too fast like they didnt tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being shos enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is shos brother in law  whatever  i love this movie   very much       this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story 
"Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of 'Joshua.' Heck, I wasn't even aware he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying, I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the leads. A sort of 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'The Omen' or any other demonic kid movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. Yet, I continued on to see how this would all resolve, hoping beyond belief, the ending climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit, it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing. And what a low-low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls  you don't see the drop, you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood. A person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike up. I'm not sure if this is called ""style"" or laziness or simply, lack of funds for special effects. We have a ""rich"" family with a crazy mom, a workaholic father attempting to balance everything, a kid  Joshua, who may/may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she's alive  and what was that about? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family to the brink? I don't think so. They were nuts prior, and no ""so-called"" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, barely any questions were answered, barely any open doors shut. I'm sure that might have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Anything. There are plenty better kid-gone-wild movies to explore.

"This was a movie that I hoped I could suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish, I knew I couldn't even watch the damn thing to close. You are almost convinced the actual war didn't even last that long. Other's will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this. But flat out, you can't go from watching Saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget about the movie budget difference or the audience - those don't preclude a director from making an intelligent movie. The length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names. I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard. The character development sequences (the soilders' flashbacks, looking back to their last moments, before being deployed) should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory. To this day, I have yet to watch the ending.

"Unfortunately, the director Amos Guttman died from Aids-related illnesses the year after making this film, so we don't know how many more gay-related films we might have had from him. I found this used DVD, from Cinevista, on Amazon, but it looks like none of his other works are still available. Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) contains full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines, which turn into a wishful dream sequence. and some drug use. This is the story of two families getting by, or trying to, but the mothers, the daughters, and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out. Jonathan (played by Gal Hoyberger) meets up with the next door neighbor Thomas, who has his own problems, of course. Either the translations are a little weak, or maybe Guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose, for a little mystery. Watching this, I get the feeling we're not getting the whole story, but that's OK. Throw in a cute gay roommate ex-lover Miki (Aki Avni, who went on to do many projects, mostly Isreali TV) Lots of smoking. Lots of worrying by the mothers. A great blues song ""All Night Long Blues"" done by an unknown female artist; if she is listed in the credits,sadly it was not translated to English. Nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect, like any other relationship. But then, USA always has been years behind other countries in this way.

"The original DeMille movie was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A very good film indeed. Hollywood's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring Yul Brynner. He of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. However, the movie did tend to get a little long in places. It does not move at the pace of the 1938 version. Still, it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once.",1,the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march  a very good film indeed  hollywoods love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner  he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies  charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius  however  the movie did tend to get a little long in places  it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version  still  it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once 
"I work at a movie store, and as such, I am always on the look-out for an excellent movie. I decided to check out Nothing as it sat in our Canadian section, and I've been trying to support my country's movie industry. I was in for a surprise. The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships...without working that hard. It is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny exchanges (""We can't be dead, we have cable!""). What more can I say without noting that it is worth a shot, even if you abandon it within the first half an hour.",1,i work at a movie store  and as such  i am always on the look out for an excellent movie  i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section  and ive been trying to support my countrys movie industry  i was in for a surprise  the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships   without working that hard  it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters  as well as some funny exchanges   we cant be dead  we have cable     what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot  even if you abandon it within the first half an hour 
"This is a great ending to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to do a double switch on the Borg was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a ""poison"" that in, essence, ended the Borg was great. The way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. However, they did bring them ""home"" and the way they did it was fantastic!! It was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. Ending it with Tom and B'Lanna having their baby just as they enter the Alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning.

"This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to that have always trusted & respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles, ""Grand Canyon"" for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama & not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) became a waste of my $1 credit at the video store.",0,this movie made me feel as if i had missed some important scenes from the very beginning  there were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started  i was very disappointed because i love whoopi goldberg   danny glover  in addition to that have always trusted   respected danny glovers taste in his choice of roles   grand canyon  for example  i just could not finish this movie  after what seemed an eternity  but was probably just a little over an hour  we had to turn it off  there was no comedy  there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them  there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited  confusing  and unnecessary  what could have been a great idea for a movie  even as a drama   not a comedy  although i think a comedy in this situation would have been better  because i love to watch white people freak out   start acting like complete idiots  it makes me laugh  became a waste of my  1 credit at the video store 
"It is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest, if any, without his presence.<br /><br />Despite a not outstanding direction - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly -, a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end.<br /><br />I have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance, even Paul Scofield acting in ""A man for all seasons"".<br /><br />Actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if Fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to Church by performing a crime.<br /><br />""Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique"" (""I am Maurice Morand, a catholic priest"")is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end.<br /><br />The other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich Morand - who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest - consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into Christ´s blood.<br /><br />Gérard - the man that wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him by himself - has to drink it if he doesn´t want to leave it in the cabaret. He does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine.<br /><br />In next scene, the dialoque between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. ""Do you carry away men too?"" asks Morand, who hates himself for what he has just done. ""That would be too much work"" is the smart answer.<br /><br />The rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time.<br /><br />I think that ""Le défroqué"" is a very strange film, but has to be seen by all viewers - if the are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history.<br /><br />",1,it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest  if any  without his presence  despite a not outstanding direction   in fact  there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly    a seemingly low budget  a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points  the presence of pierre fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end  i have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance  even paul scofield acting in  a man for all seasons   actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to church by performing a crime   je suis maurice morand  prètre catholique    i am maurice morand  a catholic priest  is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end  the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich morand   who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest   consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into christ´s blood  gérard   the man that wants to return morand to the church or replace him by himself   has to drink it if he doesn´t want to leave it in the cabaret  he does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine  in next scene  the dialoque between morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable   do you carry away men too   asks morand  who hates himself for what he has just done   that would be too much work  is the smart answer  the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time  i think that  le défroqué  is a very strange film  but has to be seen by all viewers   if the are good catholiques it is mandatory   because it is a very rare jewell in film history 
"Great movie -I loved it. Great editing and use of the soundtrack. Captures the real feeling of Indian life, yet we can all relate. A well chose cast with some great characters. The movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural. You just can't help but to root for Jess in this film!

"OK. So it's a low-budget ""film"" (I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). The acting is universally horrid, the makeup is laughable (the blood looks like it came from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally looks like they used someone's borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors.<br /><br />I might be able to forgive these low-budget traits if there were some actual content, if a movie made an attempt to tell a story. But this collection of video footage can boast of no plot, no real characters, and no momentum. It's a self-indulgent mess.<br /><br />And don't worry -- no spoilers here, 'cause there's absolutely nothing to spoil.",0,ok  so its a low budget  film   i used the quotes because it was shot in hi 8 video   the acting is universally horrid  the makeup is laughable  the blood looks like it came from sherwin williams and ive seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits   and the lighting generally looks like they used someones borrowed toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors  i might be able to forgive these low budget traits if there were some actual content  if a movie made an attempt to tell a story  but this collection of video footage can boast of no plot  no real characters  and no momentum  its a self indulgent mess  and dont worry    no spoilers here  cause theres absolutely nothing to spoil 
"""Casomai"" is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage. The story is very believable in telling the strange see-saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others, which is fairly typical in Italy (one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere, though). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and that is one of the strong points of the movie. Acting by Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and gripping. And the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well-rounded. All in all, a truly deserving movie, probably one of the best Italian movies of the year.",1, casomai  is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage  the story is very believable in telling the strange see saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others  which is fairly typical in italy  one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere  though   pavignano and dalatri were very good at writing  and that is one of the strong points of the movie  acting by stefania rocca and fabio volo is sober and gripping  and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded  all in all  a truly deserving movie  probably one of the best italian movies of the year 
"Like the Arabian Nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (It must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first.) Like the Arabian Nights it tries to cram as many Middle-Eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work. A freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ... I don't know why it all works, but it does. Everything is just so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being Hungarian in a Persian way.",1,like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that theres plot  plot and more plot  it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life  then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind mans present  where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come   it must be admitted that the second half doesnt quite live up to the promise of the first   like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work  a freed genie  a beautiful princess  a flying carpet  fantastic mechanical toys  sea voyages  a crowded marketplace  a wicked vizier  jewels     i dont know why it all works  but it does  everything is just so beautiful  the sets are beautiful  june duprez is beautiful  rozsas score is especially beautiful  as usual  it sounds hungarian  but somehow he manages to convince us that hes being hungarian in a persian way

"I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation! This film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before--namely about the Rosenstrasse (a street in Berlin)uprising of German gentile women who were married to Jews at the end of the Second World War. As such, it is a unique story, and what's more, is the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen that shows that there were GOOD Germans (the helping family in ""Anne Frank"" for instance was Dutch) who did NOT support the Nazis, and, in fact, had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their very lives. The acting is great across the board, the framing story in New York interesting and intricate, the direction from Von Trotta masterful in every scene, and the production values, including the gorgeous cinematography, outstanding. Of course the family in New York could be speaking German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family--a common occurrence. So that criticism is unwarranted. To say more would spoil the experience. The film is long, but I did not look at my watch once. I am hoping this film gets some distribution is North America, for not only is this film a masterpiece, but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the Germans because of their support of Hitler.

"My grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1998, and so we happily bought the tickets, the popcorn and soda, and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience didn't applauded strongly, I remember that I heard a few people say that they didn't like it at all, I didn't like it, I thought that it was rather stupid, and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the parts in this, I also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed. And what I really thought was bad was making the animals talk, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally a mutt! I said that apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist he brings in, this movie is not worth watching, it is rather stupid.<br /><br />I have seen Eddie Murphy in several of movies and I thought that he was funny in those, I have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie, I also have not seen Eddie Murphy in the really ""great"" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash.

"Hi, Everyone, If you saw ""Singing in the Rain,"" you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor, ""Make 'em Laugh."" If you saw ""Royal Wedding,"" you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you saw ""Jailhouse Rock,"" you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by The King himself.<br /><br />That is what is missing here. There could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was Chuck McGowan's ""I Can Do That."" the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film. Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure. He pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing.<br /><br />Yelling at people auditioning for a part in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a Western or a comedy. He is OK when he is in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at. It does not work here.<br /><br />The cast was good except for Michael, of course. A good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it.<br /><br />Next time they do one of these I hope they call me first.<br /><br />Tom Willett",0,hi  everyone  if you saw  singing in the rain   you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain  you also remember the dance number of donald oconnor   make em laugh   if you saw  royal wedding   you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling  if you saw  jailhouse rock   you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself  that is what is missing here  there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation  the closest was chuck mcgowans  i can do that   the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film  richard attenborough was to blame for this failure  he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing  yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment  michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy  he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at  it does not work here  the cast was good except for michael  of course  a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production  but someone should have thought about how to film it  next time they do one of these i hope they call me first  tom willett
"I'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the American Revolutionary War. This ain't it. (And for that matter, neither was the Emmerich/Devlin/Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I digress.)<br /><br />I saw this film at a publicity screening at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE fame), and starring Al Pacino.<br /><br />But it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats, whispering derisive comments about Pacino's horribly misconceived accent -- he was supposed to be an American frontiersman of Scottish ancestry(!) -- and that of Nastassja Kinski, who was supposed to be recently emigrated from England(!!). Then the story started and it all went downhill fast.<br /><br />Motivations were muddled, dialogue was atrocious, events had no historical or political context. What there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence; by the second or third time that alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer/pederast. His accent was all over the map too. I guess there weren't any English actors available.<br /><br />Lots of people left. Those who stayed tried to stifle giggles, then openly guffawed. I stuck it out -- I figured that at least the battle scenes might be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson chose to film them with hand-held cameras, not even Steadicam, the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity' which ruined the sense of scale.<br /><br />There was a semi-famous TV reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us. And sure enough, on his TV segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'Franklin Scale of 1 to 10', while remarking churlishly about the louts who'd disrupted the screening the night before, who clearly didn't know art when they saw it. What a buffoon.<br /><br />After this disaster, Pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered.

"Nut case is murdering college students, can new teacher stop the madness?!<br /><br />Believe me, you won't care.<br /><br />With a title like Splatter University, one would immediately gather that this movie just isn't high art. But worse than that Splatter University doesn't even qualify for amusing garbage. Splatter U is so poorly made - the story is mindless, the characters are throw-aways, and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination. Needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares. This drivel isn't even brave enough to throw in any nudity (for the cheapest thrill of all). So all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment (not even cheap laughs) and just becomes a complete bore.

"The worlds largest inside joke. The world's largest, most exclusive inside joke.<br /><br />Emulating the brash and 'everyman' humor of office space, this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary, and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist.<br /><br />The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time, listening to music and writing a novel while working.

"After going for a bike ride that day, lying beside a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it, this film made absolute sense to me.<br /><br />The imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need.

"This movie is so cheap, it's endearing!!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) providing the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history. I own 2 copies of this movie on video...on one, Ralph Macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at Major Vaugn while he is ranting at ""Hash"". Obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film, but it goes to show just how funny the movie is, when the actors themselves can't keep a straight face!!!",1,this movie is so cheap  its endearing    with ron liebmann  major vaughn  providing the most entertaining on screen diatribes in film history  i own 2 copies of this movie on video   on one  ralph macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at major vaugn while he is ranting at  hash   obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film  but it goes to show just how funny the movie is  when the actors themselves cant keep a straight face   
"I've found the movie offensive for Americans which lost somebody in the towers, for American people in general. Pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years, each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts (which have none to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize American's political behaviour, or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of September 11. Shame on them.",0,ive found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers  for american people in general  pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years  each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts  which have none to do with a terrorist attack   or criticize americans political behaviour  or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september 11  shame on them 
"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen. They remain among the most popular animated films of all time. The first was his groundbreaking classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" released in 1937. The last was the then-under appreciated ""Sleeping Beauty"" which made it's debut in 1959. In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: ""Cinderella"" (1950). Of the three films, ""Cinderella"" is the one most faithful to its origins. Ironically, unlike ""Snow White"", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. ""Cinderella"" did not follow the same path. Although it was a hit and, like ""Snow White"", was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. The result was enchanting. <br /><br />A combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft Technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston. When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his Cinderella. And indeed he had. Woods heartfelt renditions of ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""So This Is Love"" and ""Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale"" are perfect. Eleanor Audley, who would go on to voice Maleficent in ""Sleeping Beauty"", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke, and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus, Cinderella's devoted mice. William Phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and Disney) veteran, Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the Oscar-nominated ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"") her own show-stopper. <br /><br />Among the artists responsible for the ""look"" of the film, was Mary Blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney. Her elegant French-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. But, most important of all' are the believable characters--from Cinderella, right down to Lucifer, the stepmother's deliciously evil cat. They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film.<br /><br />In conjunction with the film's 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) ""Cinderella"" has just been released on a special edition DVD. It simply has never looked better. The fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful. An enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well. The DVD extras, now a standard part of Disney Platinum Editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between. But real fans will want to get the Deluxe Gift Set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. As usual for Disney, ""Cinderella"" will only be available for a limited time. So, if like me, you are a ""Cinderella"" lover, get it NOW!

"This is a good family show with a great cast of actors. It's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late. There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either, unless you count Joan of Arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth a look because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round out the rest of the main cast members, and each is terrific in their role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister Betsy; she is quite a pill, but she still cares about her mom and brother, even though she hates to show it. It may take a few episodes to really find it's legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while, so check it out people--you'll be glad you did!",1,this is a good family show with a great cast of actors  its a nice break from the reality show blitz of late  there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either  unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too  anyway  clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character  pete young  a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly  dean cain  christopher lloyd  mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members  and each is terrific in their role  i really like kirsten storms as petes sister betsy  she is quite a pill  but she still cares about her mom and brother  even though she hates to show it  it may take a few episodes to really find its legs  but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while  so check it out people  youll be glad you did

"OK. I think the TV show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved. So, when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to tag along. I wish I'd stayed home and watched the TV show instead.<br /><br />The fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie. The plot is next to non-existant, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and, worst of all, Gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever. It appears that Disney took all of the things that make Inspector Gadget work on TV and tossed them all. To be fair, my younger child (8 years old) liked the movie but the older one (10 years old) came away thinking it silly (he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor).<br /><br />Generally, I like Disney films but this one misses by a mile.

"I just recently watched this 1954 movie starring Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely Eva Gabor). Even though Price is a murderer, I actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him.<br /><br />Although this movie doesn't have the ""horror"" factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, ""House of Wax"") it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest. <br /><br />This is a must for Vincent Price fans.",1,i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies  price portrays don gallico  a magician inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions  and also his wife  portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor   even though price is a murderer  i actually found myself rooting for him  he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him  although this movie doesnt have the  horror  factor of some of his more famous roles  such as my favorite   house of wax   it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest   this is a must for vincent price fans 
"As a another reviewer states Hanna's War is an outstanding film about an outstanding person, Hanna ""Anniko"" Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately I diverge in opinion not agreeing that Miss Detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces. Maruschka Detmers performance is brave, poignant, heartfelt or understood, and totally believable. In other words for me ""In the zone."" from the opening credits. If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmers a try. My hat is off also to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film.

"I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets RIGHT are what make it worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. It is worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's not to like? Besides, name another film in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life?",1,i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh  so i have decided to write my own  i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then  first of all let me say that  overall  the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile  it doesnt matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults  it is worth watching  the idea of basing a movie on walt whitmans visit a restrictive  narrow minded anglo canadian community in southern ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis en scene  the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in people  and in that sense it is exactly accurate  the acting   especially by rip torn  whitman  and colm feore as the doctor   is very good  the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time  overall  whats not to like  besides  name another film in which whitman is brought so vividly to life 
"""My Left Foot"" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only limb in his body he had control over. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor for this film, which I'm not absolutely certain was deserved, but is still noteworthy. Day-Lewis give Brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role. My problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times. When Brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. This gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film, because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. Well made, occasionally enjoyable, but difficult to watch. May not be for everyone, but not bad at all.<br /><br />*** out of ****",1, my left foot  is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown  an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot  the only limb in his body he had control over  daniel day lewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film  which im not absolutely certain was deserved  but is still noteworthy  day lewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch  brenda fricker  as browns devoted mother  also won an oscar for a believable and touching role  my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times  when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot  the film can be difficult to watch  this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time  however  if you look beyond that  you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome  those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film  because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties  we can certainly do the same thing  well made  occasionally enjoyable  but difficult to watch  may not be for everyone  but not bad at all      out of     
"Prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there's a good reason for that because it's not one of the best...but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films. The film does have some connection to blockbusters; for a start it's an early directorial effort for Renny Harlin; the capable director behind a number of action films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen. The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison's governor. Naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance.<br /><br />The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base. This is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn't really have a 'plot' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it's never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess. The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. As the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict's ghost and while it's fairly interesting, some things about it don't make sense and it drags the film down a little. Still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that Prison is a film well worth tracking down.",1,prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films  and theres a good reason for that because its not one of the best   but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer  this is certainly among the best of the lesser known smaller films  the film does have some connection to blockbusters  for a start its an early directorial effort for renny harlin  the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2  cliffhanger and deep blue sea  and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen  the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting  we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years  this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prisons governor  naturally  the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace  and when the old execution room is reopened  the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance  the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption  but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror  the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base  this is a good job too because other than the basic premise  the film doesnt really have a plot to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting  the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but its never over the top  which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered  being released in a decade of excess  the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative  however  and provide some major highlights  as the film goes on  we start to delve more into the back story of the vengeful convicts ghost and while its fairly interesting  some things about it dont make sense and it drags the film down a little  still  everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down

"Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy-lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours? <br /><br />This is exactly what Miyazaki's ""Castle in the Sky"" is all about. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail. Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it.<br /><br />As it is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers.<br /><br />""Castle in the Sky"", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming-of-age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the ""camera"" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality.<br /><br />Even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka/San or Chihiro/Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start. As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame. For that reason, I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple.<br /><br />At the same time, ""Castle in the Sky"" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.<br /><br />Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul-mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives. ""The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them...The earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet."" Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one I've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream. I have found myself near tears just listening to it.<br /><br />""Castle in the Sky"" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids. Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is.",1,have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own  with one of your closest friends at your side  facing all sorts of dangers and villains  and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization thats just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets  even if youre not quite that much of a fantasy lover  have you ever wished you could simply experience what its like to be a kid again  and not have a care in the world  for just a couple of hours   this is exactly what miyazakis  castle in the sky  is all about  pazu  a young but very brave and ambitious engineer  lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day  a girl named sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds  while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail  simply put  it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another  and i cant help but feel my worries melt away every time i see it  as it is one of miyazakis older works and takes much place in the everyday world  the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away  howls moving castle  or even princess mononoke  still  i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other  because all three of those films are  at some point or another  mystical to the point of being enigmatic  if not perplexing  especially for the youngest of viewers   castle in the sky   on the other hand  doesnt try so much to be an allegory of any kind  and its not a coming of age story either  it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a childs mind ive ever seen  not only is the artwork beautiful  but the use of perspective from the kids eyes is just amazing  whether its the panning up of the  camera  to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead  or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air  i just cant help but feel like im there with pazu and sheeta  just a kid in another world  far far away from reality  even the kids themselves dont have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like ashitaka san or chihiro haku  sheeta is pazus angel  having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day  the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start  as the film progresses  more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions  not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be  but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film  only growing stronger all the way to the last frame  for that reason  ive fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couple  at the same time   castle in the sky  is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be  youll be sure to find your fix here  mystery  action  drama  comedy  suspense  sci fi  romance  even some western   its all here  just about everything people go to the movies for  except maybe horror   this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film  its perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works  even the ending song of the film  when translated into english  conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization  and some kind of soul mate  that could not be found in our mundane lives   the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them   the earth spins  carrying you  carrying us both wholl surely meet   miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe hiasashis gorgeous scores  but this is the only one ive seen thats both a touching love song and an inspirational dream  i have found myself near tears just listening to it   castle in the sky  may not be miyazakis most developed  spectacular  or meaningful work  but its absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be  a true vision of childhood fantasy  and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids  sit back  relax  and love it for what it is 
"Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant, gruff old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. In fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. Aren't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. Even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' cliched and obvious and John Thaw's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br />",0,goodnight  mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine  before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii  soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant  gruff old tom  who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold  our tale begins  and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is  in fact its just the old odd couple buddy formula  arent any new stories being written  as i suggested theres hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around  and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as londons citizens file politely into air raid shelters  even when the local schoolteachers husband is declared missing presumed killed  he is later restored to life  i found  goodnight  mister tom cliched and obvious and john thaws accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his  country bumpkin accent  incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one 
"I found this film to be quite an oddity. From the very get go I found it extremely hard to like this movie, and now after a little thinking about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to bits (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here, and although I can't figure for the life of me who would be better, I am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work. Everything else is fine, except for the stabs at weak comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) and I really like Richard E. Grant as the British Major.

"I might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments. ""Unique"", ""intelligent"", ""A future cult classic"" and so on... you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort.<br /><br />Because alas, Altered is a poor, weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect. The silliness is not funny. The horror and gore is not scary. And whatever ""thinking"" aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess.<br /><br />OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately, no. For starters, get very poor acting. It's not a stretch to say most B-movies these days feature better acting. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogs? Many amateurs actually do better.<br /><br />It's really the direction that puzzles. I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsen over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences.<br /><br />If there is a major flaw in Altered, it's the main set. A major part of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are confined but Sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays a major part and is as much a character (an antagonist, if you will) as the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. But no... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details.<br /><br />There's nothing salvageable here. Die hard fans of ""Blair Witch"" are better off following Daniel Myrick. Although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).",0,i might not have been the biggest blair witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort  so i was looking forward to altered  especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various imdb comments   unique    intelligent    a future cult classic  and so on    you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort  because alas  altered is a poor  weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect  the silliness is not funny  the horror and gore is not scary  and whatever  thinking  aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because theres certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess  ok  so we know nothing stands out  is it at least bearable  is the experience worthwhile in any way  unfortunately  no  for starters  get very poor acting  its not a stretch to say most b movies these days feature better acting  the plot  boring and messy  dialogs  many amateurs actually do better  its really the direction that puzzles  i did not expect major improvements over blair witch but at least small steps forward  instead  our director seems to have worsen over time  completely oblivious to previous experiences  if there is a major flaw in altered  its the main set  a major part of the plot takes place in a single location  where the main characters are confined but sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever  considering that in blair witch  the forest plays a major part and is as much a character  an antagonist  if you will  as the three students  you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here  but no    this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details  theres nothing salvageable here  die hard fans of  blair witch  are better off following daniel myrick  although his output is far from being golden  it shows better structure than sánchez and some lessons from blair witch are applied  unfortunately  in weak stories but still

"Offside is the story of teenage-girls who tried to sneak in the stadium to watch final world cup qualifying soccer match in Tehran that may lead Iran to the 2006 world cup in Germany.

Stadium guards search every one at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks and of course; no girl gets in.<br /><br />Like most of Panahi's work, his armature cast's performance was superb. You actually think that you are watching a documentary. The dialogs between the girls and the privates were executed delicately and astonishingly believable. The film depicts the interactions between captives and the drafted guards who themselves are serving mandartory away from their family and friends in a funny sort of way.

"A message movie, but a rather good one. Outstanding cast, top to bottom. Interesting in that Bette Davis's plot line is essentially back story! The extremely negative reviews (name throwing at the screenplay/playwright, associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about 'Angles in America', etc. etc.) object to the movie being too preachy about Germany in WWII. Gosh, that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me.<br /><br />Theatrical and movie-making, and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way. Yes Casablanca is a better movie (I guess), but although made in the same year and both having Nazis in them, Casablanca is primarily a love story. The love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot--more of a thriller. Both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors. The children ARE a bit tedious and could have been edited",1,a message movie  but a rather good one  outstanding cast  top to bottom  interesting in that bette daviss plot line is essentially back story  the extremely negative reviews  name throwing at the screenplay playwright  associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about angles in america  etc  etc   object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii  gosh  that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me  theatrical and movie making  and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way  yes casablanca is a better movie  i guess   but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them  casablanca is primarily a love story  the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot  more of a thriller  both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors  the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
"I wasn't really fond of the first ""Cube"" movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much. Didn't really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well I thought wrong.<br /><br />""Cube Zero"" starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never-ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the Cube. The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men's daily routine. Several questions are created from it, concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation. All of which are left entirely to the viewer. The acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie's first half moved relatively well.<br /><br />With the story moving on, one of the two ""watchers"" begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. And later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped. Here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese.<br /><br />Sent by the people who run the Cube program we are introduced to the character ""Jax"". Along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure. To start of ""Jax"" looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a James Bond movie complete with the ever ""popular"" glass eye, that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half's relatively nice pace. Whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie. With some incredibly corny lines, perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn't care. The acting itself degrades to a further low when the former ""watcher"" meets the group in the Cube. The entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it.<br /><br />Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters, dialog and acting ""Cube Zero"" is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie.",0,i wasnt really fond of the first  cube  movie  it was a good idea  but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much  didnt really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original  i was intrigued  thinking that maybe they would fix some of the originals problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters  well i thought wrong   cube zero  starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the cube  the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two mens daily routine  several questions are created from it  concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation  all of which are left entirely to the viewer  the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movies first half moved relatively well  with the story moving on  one of the two  watchers  begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing  and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped  here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese  sent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character  jax   along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure  to start of  jax  looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever  popular  glass eye  that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first halfs relatively nice pace  whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie  with some incredibly corny lines  perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didnt care  the acting itself degrades to a further low when the former  watcher  meets the group in the cube  the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it  again failing to impress on anything but weak characters  dialog and acting  cube zero  is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie 
"I was very fond of this film. It kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen. One of the better movies about the partition that I have seen. Urmila Matondkar is gorgeous too. This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth films I've seen on the partition. It's a little less mainstream than Gadar, and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on, and come out completely one the other side. This isn't typical bollywood fare, but rather an art-house type film. The best part of this movie is that it doesn't dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on the story of another. It doesn't blame or castigate but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things.",1,i was very fond of this film  it kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen  one of the better movies about the partition that i have seen  urmila matondkar is gorgeous too  this is one of the most personal and down to earth films ive seen on the partition  its a little less mainstream than gadar  and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on  and come out completely one the other side  this isnt typical bollywood fare  but rather an art house type film  the best part of this movie is that it doesnt dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on the story of another  it doesnt blame or castigate but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things 
"A charming, funny film that gets a solid grade all around. I saw a screener of this film recently at work. It was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies I see every day. So much so, that I figured I'd write in. Not sure if this film is going to theaters, but I hope it does. Its a nice film to see with friends, its a charmer, and has some funny jokes. The acting was terrific (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf. The directing was pretty good (not a film that needed to be over-directed). What really makes this film stand out I think is the writing. It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm. As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice those things! (I'm a dork).

"When this movie was released, it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a mesmerizing sort of way. The casting is silly, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that, at least not while this film was being made. But it's rather amusing to see them try. The performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry, the obvious observation) to over-the-top, with very few stops in between. The Lesley-Anne Down character seems as though she couldn't find Egypt on a map, much less expound upon its archaeological treasures. That's due at least in part to some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie. It's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egyptology, are ripe for silly, overwritten dialogue. It doesn't disappoint, and the convergence proves a double-whammy. The plot has one driving source of dramatic tension: Can this get dumber and less believable? The answer is, usually, YES. The location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low-budget production. That and the fact that there are so many well-known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher.

"Well, the movie isn't exactly ""funny.""<br /><br />Okay, I admit, there are a few HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny. For example: Right before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costars, sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he tells her, ""Okay, don't go anywhere.""<br /><br />See, humorous, but not funny.<br /><br />The plot and acting are pretty good.<br /><br />But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re-watch.<br /><br />There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars.

"In my opinion, A GUY THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law. If you ask me, they lit up the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them.

"OH WOW. I saw this film at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on 12 March 2000. Both stars were in attendance and were available for questions afterward. WHAT A GORGEOUS FILM! Although set in Ireland amid Catholic/Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given a chance to vent their hate and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story drizzled with humor and fun. If this one does not get picked up in the USA, it would truly be most unfortunate.<br /><br />As for the stars and supporting players...FIRST RATE. They call Orla Brady the Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. It is my opinion that she is BETTER than Meryl Streep. They should be calling Meryl the American Orla Brady! And, Liam Cunningham's steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant.<br /><br />SEE THIS MOVIE.",1,oh wow  i saw this film at the irish international film fleadh in manhattan on 12 march 2000  both stars were in attendance and were available for questions afterward  what a gorgeous film  although set in ireland amid catholic protestant antagonism  the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other  the horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given a chance to vent their hate and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story drizzled with humor and fun  if this one does not get picked up in the usa  it would truly be most unfortunate  as for the stars and supporting players   first rate  they call orla brady the irish meryl streep  i heard  it is my opinion that she is better than meryl streep  they should be calling meryl the american orla brady  and  liam cunninghams steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant  see this movie 
"ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score . It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is <br /><br />ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career",1,road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newmans score   its haunting and beautiful but youre aware that this music is similar to newmans other work and while listening to the soundtrack youre reminded of scent of a woman   meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption youre reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen   as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway   irish gangsters is millers crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leones gangster epics  despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldnt be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed   but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you cant help thinking what a superb director mendes is  road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances   ive never been all that keen on tom hanks but hes every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role   probably better   paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent   newmans performance works due to the subtle body language   his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top   while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadnt decided to become james bond   a role which heralds the end of an actors career
"While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris. <br /><br />""Before Sunrise"" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are stunning. The direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I have just completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb, and I choose ""Before Sunrise"" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me. I cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the Oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances.

"I was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?",1,i was really surprised with this movie  going in to the sneak preview  knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer id seen  i thought it was going to be a dude wheres my car kind of crap fest  i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because thats just how movies work  instead i got a smart  surprisingly original movie about a decent  average guy who just never had sex  yes  the film is chock full o sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey look a nipple   but its done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys  all the characters are people you probably know in real life  redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives  i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap  and i was very surprised  yea  its pretty over the top  cmon  its a movie about a 40 year old virgin    but its very smartly done  in the end  youre really pulling for this guy to get laid  which says a lot about the movie because honestly  did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not 
"Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not. When i saw the movie, i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And i was right. <br /><br />Stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie. The storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like every tale , it has some short of morality. Therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that the true love is Yvaine and not Victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative. <br /><br />I have to give extra credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character. Moreover, she and Cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable. The rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make Stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie<br /><br />Overall , the movie is FANTASTIC, the locations magical and the plot interesting.I was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.",1,although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances  it is certainly not  when i saw the movie  i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies  and i was right   stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film  it has this magical aura from the beginning to the very end of the movie  the storyline is well written   and it keeps you on the edge of your seat  like every tale   it has some short of morality  therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers wont take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey  we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria   the material girl who is shallow and manipulative   i have to give extra credits to claire danes  she literally shines in this movie  her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character  moreover  she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable  the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and high classed movie overall   the movie is fantastic  the locations magical and the plot interesting i was very disappointed that the film didnt get nominated for more awards  i have to give at least 9 10 stars for this 
"Dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making.

"To be as honest as I possibly can, The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or) is a complete bore. The movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible. There are great, long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. Characters just stand around with nothing to do. There's no mystery, no suspense, and no plot points to care about. The acting is simply abysmal. Most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do this repeatedly. And what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing. While it's not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like Orgy of the Dead, it comes close.",0,to be as honest as i possibly can  the devils plaything  or veil of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters or  is a complete bore  the movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible  there are great  long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens  characters just stand around with nothing to do  theres no mystery  no suspense  and no plot points to care about  the acting is simply abysmal  most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera  they do this repeatedly  and what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing  while its not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like orgy of the dead  it comes close 
"Deathtrap is not a whodunit. It's a who gonna do it to who first. It's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so I won't mention anything more about the plot. As far as acting goes it is Cris Reeves greatest role as Clifford, a young playwrite. You really see the range in his acting abilities in this movie from ""exhaling cheeseburgers"" to downright frightening. Clifford is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this I have never seen Clifford played well on both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac. Reeves is the only person I have seen who has the character right all the way through. As for Michael Caine he's.....well he's Michael Caine.

"This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day.

"I previously thought that this film was the lamest of the Muppet films. I would like now to retract that statement. In my opinion now, the lamest MUppet film was the TV movie IT'S A VERY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, am IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE rip off that was truly dreadful. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /><br />The best songs are that 'You Can't Take No For An Answer' song, the one the Muppet Babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (I'm told that it was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) <br /><br />The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even appearing for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line 'What better way could anything end?'. But I wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining. There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. I must state though that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three defininitive MUppet movies.",1,i previously thought that this film was the lamest of the muppet films  i would like now to retract that statement  in my opinion now  the lamest muppet film was the tv movie its a very merry muppet christmas  am its a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful  muppets take manhattan is nothing special  but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas   the best songs are that you cant take no for an answer song  the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself  as i loved the muppet babies tv show  i loved the muppet babies sequence here  im told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show   the manhattan melodies show itself was the real showstopper  with muppets from sesame street even appearing for the wedding  as kermit puts it in his final line what better way could anything end   but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining  there are cute cameos from brooke shields and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats  choreographed by the late  great jim henson himself  and the film certainly entertains  i must state though that muppet movie  great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three defininitive muppet movies

"I've often wondered just how much CASPER was meant for children...with all the issues revolving around his identity (in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, as his home is a cemetery plot), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film. Maybe Casper was meant more as a morality play, or Famous Studios felt like breaking new ground in 'reality' cartoons.<br /><br />THERE'S GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well-animated project-no doubt there. But, the plot development involving the fox (who becomes Casper's friend, but meets a tragic end) is a concern.<br /><br />Give Famous Studios credit--they tackle death with respect...but, the stark image of Casper's mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children (though the denouement does offer a happy ending, but I won't give away the ending), and the violence is rather steep, even for 1940's standards.<br /><br />This might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children--but I wouldn't pop it into the VCR for a perky cartoon break.",1,ive often wondered just how much casper was meant for children   with all the issues revolving around his identity  in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child  as his home is a cemetery plot   as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film  maybe casper was meant more as a morality play  or famous studios felt like breaking new ground in reality cartoons  theres good boos tonight is a well animated project no doubt there  but  the plot development involving the fox  who becomes caspers friend  but meets a tragic end  is a concern  give famous studios credit  they tackle death with respect   but  the stark image of caspers mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children  though the denouement does offer a happy ending  but i wont give away the ending   and the violence is rather steep  even for 1940s standards  this might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children  but i wouldnt pop it into the vcr for a perky cartoon break 
"This is just as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella.

"Paul Reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It is worthy of an Academy Award. This was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year. Reiser's wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running TV sitcom ""Mad about You"". Peter Falk did a masterful job as his dad, and Peter who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. It is a must see movie for 2005.

"What this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately with disjointed storytelling, frustrating plot-holes, and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly ""the greatest monster movie ever."" <br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff: comedy, acting and special effects. From the get-go, this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. The opening scene - the monster's origin - is campy and quick, paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. The pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. With in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where,' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action. In this the movie delivers.<br /><br />After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, kind grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. The characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. <br /><br />The monster it's self looks great: alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. The effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings.' Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in it's path. When the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel.<br /><br />Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. Plot-lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. <br /><br />As for the comedy, let me say this: I'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. However, as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years (still here) I'd like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average white-guy. That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, weren't. <br /><br />*********** SPOILER************* For example: after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral; everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. This competition is, at it's core, funny: two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy. This subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but, seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER **************<br /><br />Then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained, or, worse, are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. Finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you'd expect some comment to that nature. Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you: why even bring it up in the first place? <br /><br />This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. Of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if you get several stories, each only explained 20% of the way and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole.<br /><br />Again, I'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' Maybe its in Korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. Maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page, but never finishes one. Maybe it's OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.",0,what this movie does well is combine action and

the lazy son and his precocious little girl  kind grandfather  and talented sister  aunt  and  of course  the monster  the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent  allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work   the monster its self looks great  alien yet familiar   kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid  the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you see its strings  even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar  like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd  slipping on surfaces  crushing and eating those in its path  when the monsters path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment  and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movies appeal begins to unravel  following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity  plot lines are introduced  then abandoned  characters change their position for no apparent reason  and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent  while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random   as for the comedy  let me say this  im willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural  i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation  however  as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years  still here  id like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white guy  that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny  but  to me  werent               spoiler              for example  after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral  everyone is mourning  a new character is introduced   a brother   and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another  they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder  this competition is  at its core  funny  two brothers who dislike each other so much they even compete at a funeral   it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy  this subtle slap stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but  seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl                 end spoiler                then come the plot holes  there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained  or  worse  are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end  finding out an obstacle isnt an obstacle can be a good thing for a character  but youd expect some comment to that nature  instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti climax when problems just arent there anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start  so i ask you  why even bring it up in the first place   this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems  and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other  of course introducing new and greater problems is a time tested story telling tradition  but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation  not in this movie  instead it was as if you get several stories  each only explained 20  of the way and  in the end  the parts never converge to complete the whole  again  im willing to accept that a lot of this might be cultural  maybe its in korean story  telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy  maybe its normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every page  but never finishes one  maybe its ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis  or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves

"I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded cool and I've been wanting to see a really kick-butt Viking movie for awhile now... alas, this film was not what I was looking for. I had hoped for the best, but instead, was delivered a boring Nordic soap-opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time. The film's premise is intriguing enough: It's about a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged, insane, and violent lifetime after lifetime. The movie is filmed competently enough, with some rich cinematography and quasi-good performances by the actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end. The filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi-unique but they dropped the ball. Perhaps it could've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore... I mean, we are talking about ""Berserkers"" here, aren't we? Vikings were supposed to be BAD enough, what with all the raping and pillaging, so aren't Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme? All in all, unless you're a fan of The Young and Restless (etc...) or, are yourself, in fact, an insane Berserker who likes self torture, I'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid.",0,i had no background knowledge of this movie before i bought it  but it sounded cool and ive been wanting to see a really kick butt viking movie for awhile now    alas  this film was not what i was looking for  i had hoped for the best  but instead  was delivered a boring nordic soap opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time  the films premise is intriguing enough  its about a viking warlord who defies his god and odin is so enraged that he curses the warlords son  named barek  to death and rebirth as a berserker  this barek guy is then forced to live enraged  insane  and violent lifetime after lifetime  the movie is filmed competently enough  with some rich cinematography and quasi good performances by the actors  but again  i found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end  the filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi unique but they dropped the ball  perhaps it couldve been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore    i mean  we are talking about  berserkers  here  arent we  vikings were supposed to be bad enough  what with all the raping and pillaging  so arent berserkers supposed to be even more extreme  all in all  unless youre a fan of the young and restless  etc     or  are yourself  in fact  an insane berserker who likes self torture  id probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid 
"I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there. It just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.",0,i really wanted to like this movie  it has a nice prison setting  conspiracy theories  bloodthirsty zombies  a perfectly hideous 80s touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john saxon  who also plays a bad  you guessed it  a bad guy  it reminds me of some  beloved  italian horror flicks  but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish frightening moment in there  it just goes on and on and on  and then it  logically  has to end  more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed 
"Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home, and from Marion's double-edged ""Well that's that"".<br /><br />It's now 1950: reunion time. The gang's all here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted, and as thought-provoking and moving, as the original series.<br /><br />All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here. From Marion's family to Joss's health centre, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the best.<br /><br />A trip to Dominica's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension. There's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as, once again, fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colours, and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama.<br /><br />Lush location filming in Singapore, and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends.

"This has to be one of my favourite flicks, unlike the weak 'Elvira's Haunted Hills'...anyway I love the way the movie is a goth/com 'Wizard of Oz' story...<br /><br />Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a Good Witch (elviras Aunt Morgana)...she inherits a ""Ruby"" ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock (Her uncle)...She befriends four Characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow. There is a show down with her uncle (the wicked witch of the West) where Elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him. In the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas).<br /><br />There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie...she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: ""Youe must be aunt Em, and you must be uncle Remus....There's no place like home, there's no place like home!"" Bad uncle Vinny: ""I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!""<br /><br />There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of Kansas.<br /><br />But aside from this, the fact that one of the sequences she ""ripped off, um...I mean was inspired by FlashDance"" is pure genius...and if you don't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her ""very 80's"" Las Vegas show then you haven't got a camp bone in your body...This movie is a Cult/Camp Classic",1,this has to be one of my favourite flicks  unlike the weak elviras haunted hills   anyway i love the way the movie is a goth com wizard of oz story    elvira is a goth dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch  elviras aunt morgana    she inherits a  ruby  ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad warlock  her uncle    she befriends four characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow  there is a show down with her uncle  the wicked witch of the west  where elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him  in the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination las vegas  dorothys home in kansas   there are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie   she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters  elvira   youe must be aunt em  and you must be uncle remus    theres no place like home  theres no place like home   bad uncle vinny   ill get you my pretty  and your little dog too   there is a sign that elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of kansas  but aside from this  the fact that one of the sequences she  ripped off  um   i mean was inspired by flashdance  is pure genius   and if you dont roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her  very 80s  las vegas show then you havent got a camp bone in your body   this movie is a cult camp classic
"Alain Delon visits swift, sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit-man in the Duccio Tessari thriller ""Big Guns"" after they accidentally murder his wife and child. Tessari and scenarists Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of ""A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die,"" and Franco Verucci of ""Ring of Death"" take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire. Indeed, ""Big Guns"" is rather predictable, but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings. Alain Delon of ""The Godson"" is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte of ""The Godfather"" plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the Delon character, but the rest of his hard-nosed associates want the hit-man dead. Like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, ""Big Guns"" subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari does not waste a second in this 90-minute shoot'em up. Apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father, the worst thing that takes place occurs in an automobile salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a junked car. Ostensibly, ""Big Guns"" is a rather bloodless outing, but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama. Only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact. Tessari stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets. The photography and the compositions are excellent.",1,alain delon visits swift  sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit man in the duccio tessari thriller  big guns  after they accidentally murder his wife and child  tessari and scenarists roberto gandus  ugo liberatore of  a minute to pray  a second to die   and franco verucci of  ring of death  take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire  indeed   big guns  is rather predictable  but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings  alain delon of  the godson  is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter  richard conte of  the godfather  plays a sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the delon character  but the rest of his hard nosed associates want the hit man dead  like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s   big guns  subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay  interestingly  the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice  tessari does not waste a second in this 90 minute shootem up  apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father  the worst thing that takes place occurs in an automobile salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a junked car  ostensibly   big guns  is a rather bloodless outing  but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama  only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact  tessari stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets  the photography and the compositions are excellent

"When i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. I watched then with very low expectations. Now this movie isn't bad per se. You get what you pay for. It is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. Despite the bad acting, cliché lines, and sub par camera work. I didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player.

"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10.

They have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in stinging nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring, stunts in a work place, e.g. army, cowboys, and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves.

"""Look, I know this may suck right now, but pain is temporary, film is forever. Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come.""  Robert De Niro<br /><br />This was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro. Like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""War of the Worlds"", the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. <br /><br />In typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every ""daddy"" figure in Spielberg land, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys.<br /><br />But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating.<br /><br />An artist's failures or misfires are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art. When the story doesn't work, the characters don't connect or the images don't sear, we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core. This  the remaining carcass- is what the director's cinema is about.<br /><br />Now ""Cape Fear"" is an impersonal film, so we won't find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography (""You already sacrificed me!"" De Niro yells, but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter). What the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on. Watch how Scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention. But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense. A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment. <br /><br />The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera always has to be bound, or intimately tethered, to his central character. For the world around the character to make sense, his camera has to be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook ""close up-mid shot-wide shot"" combinations, but Scorsese can't do this. There's no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He's all about the character. You break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses. He simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for action film-making.<br /><br />Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with ""Gangs of New York"", where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor drawing Scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.<br /><br />5/10  Even as a generic B-movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking film. Look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown. Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene. In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both aroused and repelled by this man's interest.<br /><br />But De Niro's performance, so deliciously over the top, simply can't be imitated by Scorsese. You'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work. But Scorsese? Nope.<br /><br />Worth one viewing.",0, look  i know this may suck right now  but pain is temporary  film is forever  whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come    robert de niro this was initially a film for steven spielberg  the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes  and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro  like  jurassic park    poltergeist  and  war of the worlds   the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast  the beast being the creation of the father  a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial   in typical spielberg fashion  the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins  like oscar schindler  robin williams  sam niel  tom cruise and virtually every  daddy  figure in spielberg land  the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoys  but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese  who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare  the result is arguably the worst film in scorseses filmography  and  ironically  his most illuminating  an artists failures or misfires are often very revealing  exposing the inner workings of their art  when the story doesnt work  the characters dont connect or the images dont sear  we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core  this  the remaining carcass  is what the directors cinema is about  now  cape fear  is an impersonal film  so we wont find any thematic connections to the rest of scorseses filmography   you already sacrificed me   de niro yells  but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter   what the film does  though  is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on  watch how scorseses camera desperately whips back and forth  how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention  but more importantly  watch how the film makes no spatial sense  a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage  a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the familys house doesnt seem to exist anywhere in particular  there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture  scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment   the reason for this is that scorseses camera always has to be bound  or intimately tethered  to his central character  for the world around the character to make sense  his camera has to be focused on the character  resnais can take you around a french hotel  welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building  cameron can give you a tour of the titanic  scott can recreate an entire future cityscape  lucas can give you an alien desert planet  and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook  close up mid shot wide shot  combinations  but scorsese cant do this  theres no poetry  no sense of tangible space in his films  hes all about the character  you break that tether  you leave that boxing ring  that taxi cab  you look away from de niro  and everything collapses  he simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting  which  in a way  is a prerequisite for action film making  scorsese tried to rectify this problem with  gangs of new york   where the space and the sets become the central character  but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis  the actor drawing scorseses camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb  5 10  even as a generic b movie  this is an ugly  vulgar looking film  look at the matte paintings  the inept attempts at tension  the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown  still  we have robert de niro to pick up the slack  de niro  who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ  gives the film its only great scene  in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis  he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her  a kind of symbolic rape  the girl runs away  both aroused and repelled by this mans interest  but de niros performance  so deliciously over the top  simply cant be imitated by scorsese  youd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work  but scorsese  nope  worth one viewing 
"Normally when I write a review for a movie online, it is for one of three reasons. Either, I have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent, I feel that the public's perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons, or I believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers. While all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative, I find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as, ""This is one of the best films of all time!"", does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides, nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good, which should be the point of the review in the first place. With that being said, War of the Worlds is nothing more than a hurried, incompetent attempt at a money grab; piggy-backing its loathsome carcass on the multi-million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg. Many people will buy this DVD in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject. This movie is not even ""so bad"" that it becomes funny or endearing, rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger. Now with most of the insults out of the way, allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than I. <br /><br />Judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film (I found it as SAM's Club for 8 bucks), I assumed that the cast would be no-names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular. Check. This is not a big deal for me, as I find a large budget and an over-reliance on big name stars and SE can diminish an otherwise decent movie. I also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score. Check again. What I did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien/battle scenes. <br /><br />Now, as per IMDb's policy any spoilers must be announced in advance, no matter how small, so here is fair warning. The movie opens with a lot of inane small-talk, followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot. Seriously, it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube. It is very hard to describe every little issue in depth, but by the end of the first ten minutes, the combination of shaky camera-work, spliced scenes, and a LOT of walking begin to frustrate the viewer. However, the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going. The next 30 minutes basically go as follows: one of the main characters walks to one of the pods, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot. They both walk back to town. These walks aren't two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged. They are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie. In a particularly grueling scene, the main character is shown looking at a pod, then he is shown pacing and panting, then he looks at the pod, then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town, then comes in to town and walks into a building, then he has a cup of coffee and says ""Thank you Mary"" to a random maid that serves him coffee, then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building, then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod. I apologize for the extreme run-on sentence, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film. Characters speak way too long about mundane things, they walk a lot, they send other people to walk, the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed, but for no dramatic effect, simply the camera man is a sophomore at Tech somewhere. The editing is mind-bogglingly bad. People actions make little sense. For instance, when the professor goes to a farmer's house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town, the farmer stutters and paces around. When the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside, the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later. Nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk. The entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film, but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion. I have seen better high school video productions. Finally, the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story. I get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage. However, it is so awful in technical aspects, and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad. Avoid this film at all costs.",0,normally when i write a review for a movie online  it is for one of three reasons  either  i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent  i feel that the publics perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons  or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers  while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative  i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as   this is one of the best films of all time    does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides  nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good  which should be the point of the review in the first place  with that being said  war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried  incompetent attempt at a money grab  piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg  many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject  this movie is not even  so bad  that it becomes funny or endearing  rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger  now with most of the insults out of the way  allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i   judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film  i found it as sams club for 8 bucks   i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular  check  this is not a big deal for me  as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie  i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score  check again  what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes   now  as per imdbs policy any spoilers must be announced in advance  no matter how small  so here is fair warning  the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk  followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot  seriously  it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube  it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth  but by the end of the first ten minutes  the combination of shaky camera work  spliced scenes  and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer  however  the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going  the next 30 minutes basically go as follows  one of the main characters walks to one of the pods  he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot  they both walk back to town  these walks arent two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged  they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie  in a particularly grueling scene  the main character is shown looking at a pod  then he is shown pacing and panting  then he looks at the pod  then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town  then comes in to town and walks into a building  then he has a cup of coffee and says  thank you mary  to a random maid that serves him coffee  then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building  then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod  i apologize for the extreme run on sentence  but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film  characters speak way too long about mundane things  they walk a lot  they send other people to walk  the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed  but for no dramatic effect  simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere  the editing is mind bogglingly bad  people actions make little sense  for instance  when the professor goes to a farmers house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town  the farmer stutters and paces around  when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside  the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later  nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene  as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk  the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film  but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion  i have seen better high school video productions  finally  the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story  i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage  however  it is so awful in technical aspects  and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad  avoid this film at all costs 
"""A Christmas Story"" is one of many people's all-time most beloved films. ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have. It had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare.<br /><br />So I awaited (and awaited) its sequel, ""It Runs In The Family"" . The film was almost released a couple of times, only to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and is, I guess) a total failure.<br /><br />The sets and cinematography were just fine, but the directing totally, completely missed the mark. The film was nothing more than a cash-flow formula of lazy casting, lazy writing, and disconnected acting.<br /><br />The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of America's great humorists and story-tellers, forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in ACS. He over-emoted, and why he did that I'll never know. He somehow managed to become an annoying, overwrought parody of himself.<br /><br />The writing and acting in IRITF is inauthentic and forced. The actors may have seen ACS, but whatever wit and nuance that was in ACS mustn't have registered at all on any of them. The acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of Shepard's dry humor.<br /><br />ACS will always be a real treasure, but to call IRITF a sequel is to insult all of the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.",0, a christmas story  is one of many peoples all time most beloved films  acs was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have  it had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare  so i awaited  and awaited  its sequel   it runs in the family    the film was almost released a couple of times  only to be pulled at the last minute  when it finally came out  iritf was  and is  i guess  a total failure  the sets and cinematography were just fine  but the directing totally  completely missed the mark  the film was nothing more than a cash flow formula of lazy casting  lazy writing  and disconnected acting  the narrator  jean shepard  who was one of americas great humorists and story tellers  forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in acs  he over emoted  and why he did that ill never know  he somehow managed to become an annoying  overwrought parody of himself  the writing and acting in iritf is inauthentic and forced  the actors may have seen acs  but whatever wit and nuance that was in acs mustnt have registered at all on any of them  the acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of shepards dry humor  acs will always be a real treasure  but to call iritf a sequel is to insult all of the fans of jean shepard and acs 
"A realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older, non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults.<br /><br />This movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse. Typical plot some may say, but this really was unexpected. <br /><br />I found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in their story. Moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances. <br /><br />It's a bright film that I would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love.

"Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people lived back then just to surf. Their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. They didn't care about money, jobs, girls or any thing. To them the waves were their girls. I have never been on a surf board, and it looks so hard, I don't understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. This is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie.

"I sometimes enjoy really lousy movies....those that occasionally result when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster. Movies like ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", ""Manos-Hands of Fate"", and ""Heavens Gate"", etc.<br /><br />So, when I heard that this movie, ""Rachel's Attic"", was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade, naturally I just HAD to see it.<br /><br />Boy, do I regret that decision.

The acting, filming, script, etc. are even worse than a low budget porno film: the sound is utterly horrible, the ""plot"" is completely incomprehensible, the ""acting"" is laughable....it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money.

"Deanna Durbin really did save Universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio. By the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at Universal eg Milestone, Browning and Wyler had gone. Only James Whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short ""Every Sunday"" and initially Garland was suggested for the role of Penny in ""Three Smart Girls"". When Garland was unavailable Universal switched to Durbin. Initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster the film had a European touch.<br /><br />The film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in ""Switzerland"". The ""three smart girls"" of the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Grey), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are sailing with Penny giving her glorious voice to ""My Heart is Singing"". All is not too well on the home front - their father is planning to remarry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes) so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and reunite him with their mother. Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's stern mother in ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1941).<br /><br />Donna is a gold-digger who, along with her scatty mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone with no film experience Deanna is wonderful as Penny, a typical pesky, over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture. When she sings ""Someone to Care for Me"" to her father you will just melt - what a glorious voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines in the film. When her father consoles her with ""I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow"", she replies ""Oh I can see enough monkeys around here""!!!<br /><br />With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire a ""count"" (Mischa Auer)to romance Donna. They arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix-up Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is mistaken for the count and Donna falls for him (she thinks he owns half of Australia!!!) The plan backfires as he falls for Kay and Donna wants to hasten her marriage to Judson.<br /><br />Penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away.

"I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews but I do know that, as happens often on Amazon.com, there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same, somewhat obscure talking points, almost verbatim. A campaign? Only IMDb knows.<br /><br />As for this movie: it's fine. It's a funny, cute and very straightforward movie.<br /><br />It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids. Is the grandmother a bizarre character? Yup. Do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this? Yes, thankfully, they do. Are other movies set in the LES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible? You betcha. Does that make this movie a crime  as some of the (to my eyes, astroturf) comments would suggest? Hardly. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.<br /><br />This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Scoff at the comparison but _we've never had that_ and I'm touched, to the core, by this movie's humility of purpose and tender spirit.<br /><br />That said, I'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting! :-D",1,i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that  as happens often on amazon com  there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same  somewhat obscure talking points  almost verbatim  a campaign  only imdb knows  as for this movie  its fine  its a funny  cute and very straightforward movie  its been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn  lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx  but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids  is the grandmother a bizarre character  yup  do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this  yes  thankfully  they do  are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican   puerto rican kids possible  you betcha  does that make this movie a crime  as some of the  to my eyes  astroturf  comments would suggest  hardly  let a thousand plastic flowers bloom  this is better than any episode of degrassi jr  high or degrassi high  scoff at the comparison but  weve never had that  and im touched  to the core  by this movies humility of purpose and tender spirit  that said  id love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting    d
"A truly dreadful film. I did not know initially that this was a Kiwi effort - but very soon I started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake American ones. Why did it need to be set n America anyway? - it could have been set in NZ and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with American accents? A bad bad film. I am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at a Segal/Willis type action man flick.A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! If there was any TAXPAYER money in this piece of trash, I would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the Treasury. I am still reeling (get it? pun, reeling!) at the absolute garbage I have just seen. Why did I continue to watch?

Pee yew, pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work, written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns, and poop and fart jokes. For example, Gene Stapelton's (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) character telling Marilu Henner's character that she ""swings both ways"" sexually, was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie...

"Having watched this movie on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or ""delights"" as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me. The plot isn't really worth commenting as, but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into Yeti territory. Before the movie is over, we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out, yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, yetis ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them, a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin, a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm, a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe, yet then jumps off, and a whole collection of further, bizarre occurrences. Basically, if you aren't staying up on a Saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of SciFi channel original movies, avoid this film like the plague. Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says: ""It's the best movie I have ever seen.""

"Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things, it just tells us a story, one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters, it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again, feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry at times, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life, and that of my friends, and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours.",1,radiofreccia is a movie about all of us  about our dreams  our friends  our obsessions  our addictions  our fears  it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century  the movie doesnt take a happy or sad approach on things  it just tells us a story  one that all of us could have experienced  one of happiness and excitement  sadness and grief  the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters  it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again  feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place  hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends  listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international  playing their dreams  our dreams  radiofreccia will make you laugh  it will make you cry at times  it will shock you and comfort you  it will give you and take from you  personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life  and that of my friends  and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours 
"I don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it. Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about. Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner. Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song. Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s. Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole. Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out.

"Based on a true story, this series is a gem within its kind. The slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village.<br /><br />In the diamond mining town of Tijuco in Brazil, the diamond commender--appointed by the king of Portugal--is the ultimate authority. Having grown up in the relative security of his house, the young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town, refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter. In a desperate bid to save herself, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king, intending to use them to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day, however, and when the loot turns up missing, the diamond commender is led away in chains, his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs. Martin, the diamond commender's son, swears vengeance. Xica and the other slaves, however, are sold at auction, and Xica ends up in the home of the Sergeant Major, an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust. To the town of Tijuco, however, comes the new diamond commender, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Immediately struck by Xica's beauty, he manipulates the Sergeant Major into selling her to him. And thus begins a love story, filled with danger, intrigue and passion, between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen.<br /><br />The series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute. At times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of suspense and unexpected twists. ""Xica da Silva"" is definitely a must.

"I think that the movie was kind of weird. In the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. He doesn't get mentioned again. The special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie. It isn't the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie. I give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale.",1,i think that the movie was kind of weird  in the opening scene  a person is killed for no reason  he doesnt get mentioned again  the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie  it isnt the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie  i give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale 
"I loathed this film. The original Phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. Like many 70s horror flicks, it looked and felt like some creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained this nice attention to mood. Sadly, Phantasm III is just awful. It tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films, which diminishes rather than expands their power. It shamelessly degrades imagery from the first Phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the draft. Didn't anyone-- the prop master, the DP, the editor, the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy? Even worse, Phantasm III presents one corny, unfunny joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first film. The original Phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about Reggie's horniness: several refer to the film's ""flying balls"" ha-ha, oh, I get it, balls.

"""Welcome to Collingwood"" offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of, was the 1958 Italian film ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"", directed by Mario Monicelli.<br /><br />The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, in it, can't be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine.<br /><br />The film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell. No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake. Whatever could go wrong, and more, is what they succeed in doing. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo's funeral.<br /><br />The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these small time crooks do their thing.

Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") is fantastic.

"This film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind. First, the central father-son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his Wong Fei Hung film ""Drunken Master"" (ideas from this film recur in ""Drunken Master II), and not ""Young Master""; that Chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly; and, indeed, the film conveys a sense of being incomplete; for instance, the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film. ""Young Master"", from the same period, also feels underdone, but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end. This film feels as though Chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme, only to abandon the effort, possibly due to time and budget.<br /><br />Or perhaps the film is simply over-ambitious. This is an important turning point film in Chan's career, because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns - which is why there's such a lack of kung fu throughout the film. Chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it. But both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot-twists.<br /><br />That leaves us with the comedy. Since Chan's concern is character-development, the comedy is largely character driven - as in the conflict between Chan's character and his best friend, an argument over a girl. But there's plenty of slapstick as well. Frankly, I find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot.<br /><br />This film represents an effort on Chan's part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time. It doesn't quite work, and Chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films, with the making of the contemporary action comedy ""Police Story"". But going back to view this film is still very informative as to how Chan worked his way through the historical genre, and perhaps why he abandoned it.",1,this film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind  first  the central father son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong fei hung film  drunken master   ideas from this film recur in  drunken master ii   and not  young master   that chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly  and  indeed  the film conveys a sense of being incomplete  for instance  the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film   young master   from the same period  also feels underdone  but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end  this film feels as though chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme  only to abandon the effort  possibly due to time and budget  or perhaps the film is simply over ambitious  this is an important turning point film in chans career  because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns   which is why theres such a lack of kung fu throughout the film  chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it  but both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot twists  that leaves us with the comedy  since chans concern is character development  the comedy is largely character driven   as in the conflict between chans character and his best friend  an argument over a girl  but theres plenty of slapstick as well  frankly  i find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot  this film represents an effort on chans part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time  it doesnt quite work  and chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films  with the making of the contemporary action comedy  police story   but going back to view this film is still very informative as to how chan worked his way through the historical genre  and perhaps why he abandoned it 
"Ridiculous fluff, that compounds its error by trying to have meaning. Joan, this time as a congresswoman, Agatha Reed, chairwoman of a committee dedicated to ""investigating the high cost of food."" Says Congresswoman Reed, ""The housewife has been getting it in the neck too long. I'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the American family can take a vacation once a year, see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant."" She's all business, but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from Good Hope College, where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night (the parallel to Joan's real life is unmistakable here, as it is in all Joan Movies). The degree causes much consternation on campus (""That would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education!"")  but Joan is unaware of this as she arrives. The college president, Jim Merrill, played by Robert Young, at his handsomest, happens to be Joan's former teacher  and lover. It was with *him* that she spent the night out, all those years ago, but Joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married. Naturally, this high-profile event will be covered by *Life* magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be? Yet another of Joan's old lovers  this one, she hung out with in China ""during the war"", and he thinks Joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame. Eve Arden, playing Joan's assistant, ""Woodie,"" is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job, if you didn't like her so much. But you not only like Eve in this, as in all her roles, you adore her. She is so droll and no-nonsense, you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys. When Joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater, Eve tells her it ""looks fierce."" But Joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings, she, Joan, sees youth  herself at 18 ""eager, expectant  a little frightened, asking 'What is life? What am I?'"" But, of course, if we actually go into depth about Joan at 18, the truth may be a little different. <br /><br />For me, this is the major problem in watching any Joan movie. You can call her characters whatever you want to, but it's always all Joan, all the time. So, since what we're always seeing is Joan being herself, it's easy to dispense with character's names. It's just that it gets confusing when Joan tries to tell us something patently untrue, like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18, Joan had already been around the block several times. Many men would have described her as eager, and as far as being expectant, she had already had several abortions at this point. But that's a personal problem, and I digress, but I simply wanted to explain why I say things such as ""and then Joan does"" this or that, or ""We see Joan as..."" when we are not literally watching a home movie.<br /><br />There is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which Joan is given the Clara Bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that Joan and Clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe Joan is much younger than she actually looks. It fails. What also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness. In the story, Joan has written a book about free speech and made a film (no, not the one about the plumber), and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical, Dr. Pitt, who is about to be fired for his views, which are shockingly similar to Joan's. This is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one, to be sure, but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion.",0,ridiculous fluff  that compounds its error by trying to have meaning  joan  this time as a congresswoman  agatha reed  chairwoman of a committee dedicated to  investigating the high cost of food   says congresswoman reed   the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long  im going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year  see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant   shes all business  but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college  where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night  the parallel to joans real life is unmistakable here  as it is in all joan movies   the degree causes much consternation on campus   that would make it the most broad minded institution in the history of education     but joan is unaware of this as she arrives  the college president  jim merrill  played by robert young  at his handsomest  happens to be joans former teacher  and lover  it was with  him  that she spent the night out  all those years ago  but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married  naturally  this high profile event will be covered by  life  magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be  yet another of joans old lovers  this one  she hung out with in china  during the war   and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame  eve arden  playing joans assistant   woodie   is at her butchest and most smart alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job  if you didnt like her so much  but you not only like eve in this  as in all her roles  you adore her  she is so droll and no nonsense  youd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys  when joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater  eve tells her it  looks fierce   but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings  she  joan  sees youth  herself at 18  eager  expectant  a little frightened  asking what is life  what am i   but  of course  if we actually go into depth about joan at 18  the truth may be a little different   for me  this is the major problem in watching any joan movie  you can call her characters whatever you want to  but its always all joan  all the time  so  since what were always seeing is joan being herself  its easy to dispense with characters names  its just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue  like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18  joan had already been around the block several times  many men would have described her as eager  and as far as being expectant  she had already had several abortions at this point  but thats a personal problem  and i digress  but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as  and then joan does  this or that  or  we see joan as     when we are not literally watching a home movie  there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that joan and clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks  it fails  what also fails is an attempt at early 50s political correctness  in the story  joan has written a book about free speech and made a film  no  not the one about the plumber   and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical  dr  pitt  who is about to be fired for his views  which are shockingly similar to joans  this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one  to be sure  but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion 
"Salvage is the worst so called horror film I've ever seen. There is nothing remotely horrific about it. It doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine. First of all i don't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie. If I wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it. Second: the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly. Third: the story sucks, its been used before, and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summery on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it. I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their name. All hail Anthony Perkins!!!!!!!!!",0,salvage is the worst so called horror film ive ever seen  there is nothing remotely horrific about it  it doesnt deserve to be in a genre so fine  first of all i dont see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie  if i wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it  second  the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly  third  the story sucks  its been used before  and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse  read the summery on the back of the case  it reveals the whole story  i do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it  i feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name  all hail anthony perkins

"If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America, can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton on for size?<br /><br />This is one of the best of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out. It's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build. It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree.<br /><br />Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment. <br /><br />He's a persistent cuss and he does succeed. Of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /><br />It's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can be played for laughs. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />Other than Guinness the best performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br /><br />Come to think of it, did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?",1,if the man in the white suit had been done in america  cant you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinnesss sidney stratton on for size  this is one of the best of alec guinnesss films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out  its so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build  its amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree  alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning  that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment   hes a persistent cuss and he does succeed  of course the implications havent really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society  in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive  almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist   its the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films ive mentioned can be played for laughs  poor guinnesss suit is not only white and stain repellent  but it glows like a neon sign  other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf  joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk   come to think of it  did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever

"Paulie was cute, cool, enjoyable and quite fulfilling. I went to this movie expecting to view a typical ""family"" movie, one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor. My mindframe immediately changed when I was quickly captivated by the movie's wholesomeness. It is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined ""wholesome"". Most are cheaply made, written and produced purely to attract young family members, who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots.<br /><br />Oh yes, Paulie had a plot. It told the story of a young girl(Marie) and her best friend Paulie the parrot, who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her. Marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable, and thought Paulie to be damaging to his 4-year old daughter's mental health, and quickly tore them apart. We follow Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. Oh yeah, Paulie really could (smart)talk and had a swift New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted. Paulie is the best family movie I have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. No sleeping.

"Millie is a sap. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a sap! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like ""Madam X"" but much, much less focused. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs.

"Somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like U.F.O, Troma and beneath them lie Seduction cinema.<br /><br />Seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed, non-hardcore erotic movies. It has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star Misty Mundae. I say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show Masters of Horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget S.C efforts which forces the company to find a new identity. But back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world.<br /><br />The gorgeous Misty Mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father. At the school she meets her absurdly hot room-mate played by Ruby Larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress (Barbara Joyce) has other plans. In typical S.C style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances. Ms. Larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views Misty as a tasty meal and Darian Caine makes a welcome (though brief) appearance as Satan. This is the sort of film that Jess Franco would crank out in the 70s (although this one does not have the hardcore sex that Franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales) and fans of that madman's work would be wise to give this one a go.<br /><br />To me, as a long time zero budget cinema fan (and Troma worshiper), I came across the Seduction cinema films through their parody films (Playmate of the apes, Who wants to be a erotic billionaire) but I actually prefer their more original works. You either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films. For me the most obvious thing that unites these no-budget movies is a real sense of fun. These low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland, by the numbers, studio efforts that load up the multiplexes.<br /><br />If you have never seen a Seduction cinema film either this or Sin Sisters (featuring both of the Mundae sisters) are excellent choices to begin with. This one is a fun, fast paced film (although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old) and the DVD is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings, a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening.

"I was unsure whether or not Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit ""Malibu Express."" With his film Fit to Kill he has proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. The plot written by Sidaris, which was ungratefully passed up by the Academy, is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns. The main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In ""Fit to Kill"" they confront their long-time nemesis Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most prized diamonds. A well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic. Panned by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in years to come. It is now suffering the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver did, but in the future will undoubtly become recognized. I am disappointed no critic circles have recognized Andy Sidaris's trademark filmmaking. The costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking. It may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the blockbuster Runaway Bride, and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero.

"-The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her. Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog. This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that's really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.<br /><br />-This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time. The production designs are just stunning in this movie. From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema. The music and songs are also well done. Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, ""I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas"" as one of the great musical moments in movies. I'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.<br /><br />-What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like ""Two Towers"" and ""Silent Hill"". Way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. One of my favorite shots in ""Two Towers"" is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that's what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie. They're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings.<br /><br />-It's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of ""Aladdin"" got their inspiration. The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet. It's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that I'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie. I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it's amazing. That's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time. Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break. Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard.<br /><br />-If you ever wanted to see a live action version of ""Aladdin"" then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea.",1, the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful  but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad  the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with  but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her  jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog  this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa  restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess  during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds  a giant spider thats really hungry  and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen   this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses  genies  flying carpets  and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs  it doesnt have any cheesy moments and the love story isnt a waste of time  the production designs are just stunning in this movie  from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter  even though this movie is over 40 years old  the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in todays cinema  the music and songs are also well done  anyone who sees it will no doubt hail   i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas  as one of the great musical moments in movies  im usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but ill be more than happy to make an exception for this movie   what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you dont see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like  two towers  and  silent hill   way before todays modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place  one of my favorite shots in  two towers  is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates  the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor  and thats what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie  theyre just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though theyre all just fantasy beings   its literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of  aladdin  got their inspiration  the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet  its not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since its nice to know that im not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie  i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think its amazing  thats a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time  sure  the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break  not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standard   if you ever wanted to see a live action version of  aladdin  then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this wont be their cup of tea 
"Must have to agree with the other reviewer. This has got to be the WORST movie, let alone western I have ever seen. Terrible acting, dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic (let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s), and oh, did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene. And the ending? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie...completely awful. And yes, it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable ""let's remember when"" shots when a main character dies. Luckily I saw this on free TV. Don't waste your time.",0,must have to agree with the other reviewer  this has got to be the worst movie  let alone western i have ever seen  terrible acting  dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic  let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s   and oh  did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters  i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene  and the ending  the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie   completely awful  and yes  it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable  lets remember when  shots when a main character dies  luckily i saw this on free tv  dont waste your time 
"This remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however Scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch.<br /><br />DeNiro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work he does, however he needs direction to focus his talent, and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film.<br /><br />Gregory Peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this.<br /><br />Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than Lorenzo's Oil but is not on the same form as ""Weeds"". Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation.<br /><br />Some good points? The start credits(!), the first view of Cody's back when doing dips in the prison, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden's decent into full-fledged panic, Cody's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence.<br /><br />The worst? The ""Cleaning woman - BUT NOT REALLY!!!"" part. Clinging bare-handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Are there no speed bumps in the US?)

"I watched the trailer on the DVD after seeing the film, and I think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. It made much of the fact that the film was ""by the director of Cube"" and made it look like a horror film, when in fact it is an Absurdist comedy (IMDB's spell checker doesn't seem to think that Absurdist is a word, but it is), reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are Dead.<br /><br />I love the way the story builds up slowly at first, then gradually escalates. I also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film. That and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to Cube. I recommend it.",1,i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film  and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed  it made much of the fact that the film was  by the director of cube  and made it look like a horror film  when in fact it is an absurdist comedy  imdbs spell checker doesnt seem to think that absurdist is a word  but it is   reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead  i love the way the story builds up slowly at first  then gradually escalates  i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film  that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube  i recommend it 
"Scary Movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments. It all begins when roving reporter Cindy Campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps. She soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe-threatening developments including alien invaders, killer videotapes, freaky crop circles and much more. Faced with conspiracies of massive proportions, and a crew of very strange people following her around, Cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again. The plot is a non-issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less. This time around they focus on Signs, The Ring, Matrix Reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones. The first one was {imo} one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny. The third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special. Let's just say that I didn't mind seeing it once but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. The jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve Charlie Sheen. The lame ones usually involve Anthony Anderson as he is very overrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated. Simon Rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad. Regina Hall also returns as Brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos. Their in the opening sequence spoofing The Ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film. Denise Richards, Queen Latifah, Camryn Manheim and many others also have cameos. David Zucker directs and while this isn't another Airplane, it's also not another My Boss's Daughter either. Its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not. Like I said before if you do like it, you probably won't really like it that much. In the end, I found it a bit disappointing as the PG-13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed. Rating 6.3/10",0,scary movie 3 isnt as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments  it all begins when roving reporter cindy campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps  she soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe threatening developments including alien invaders  killer videotapes  freaky crop circles and much more  faced with conspiracies of massive proportions  and a crew of very strange people following her around  cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again  the plot is a non issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less  this time around they focus on signs  the ring  matrix reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones  the first one was  imo  one of the funniest films i have ever seen  the second one wasnt as good but still quite funny  the third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special  lets just say that i didnt mind seeing it once but i probably wouldnt want to see it again  the jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve charlie sheen  the lame ones usually involve anthony anderson as he is very overrated  why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isnt funny  anna faris gives a funny performance and shes also kind of underrated  simon rex shows some potential as he actually wasnt so bad  regina hall also returns as brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance  the rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos  jenny mccarthy and pamela anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos  their in the opening sequence spoofing the ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film  denise richards  queen latifah  camryn manheim and many others also have cameos  david zucker directs and while this isnt another airplane  its also not another my bosss daughter either  its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not  like i said before if you do like it  you probably wont really like it that much  in the end  i found it a bit disappointing as the pg 13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed  rating 6 3 10

"I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but, wow, did it turn corny, or should I say, ""just plain stupid."" This is just another example of outdated humor. It might have been funny in 1940, but not now....not even close.<br /><br />Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the Busby Berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it, too.<br /><br />He was fine as ""Jimmy MacDonald,"" but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who did nothing but shout all the time. He was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie.",0,i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but  wow  did it turn corny  or should i say   just plain stupid   this is just another example of outdated humor  it might have been funny in 1940  but not now    not even close  dick powell is always interesting to watch  i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where hes mature and sounds it  too  he was fine as  jimmy macdonald   but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters  the worst being the boss  raymond walburn  of the maxford house coffee company  who did nothing but shout all the time  he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie 
"A terrible movie as everyone has said. What made me laugh was the cameo appearance by Scott McNealy, giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft. They have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire?<br /><br />There's no public record I see of SUN's involvement, but clearly the makers of this movie know Scott McNealy.

"""The Notorious Bettie Page"" (2005) <br /><br />Directed By: Mary Harron <br /><br />Starring: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, & David Strathairn <br /><br />MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for nudity, sexual content and some language) <br /><br />It seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are very posh right now. ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is the latest of these to be released on DVD. It features Gretchen Mol as the world's most famous pin-up model, Bettie Page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color. Unlike ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"", and ""Finding Neverland"", however, this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the Oscars this year. This movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested. This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. In fact, ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie--a solid work of cinema. This film focuses more on Page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. It is filmed with fervor and care and Mary Harron's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about.<br /><br />Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her. She is a woman who had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time. Now, most people know her as one of America's first sex symbols--a legend to many models, especially those of Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. She lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and Page's bondage-style photos were just the thing to push the American public into an uproar. In fact, the photos launched a full-fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn.<br /><br />The performances in ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol standing out. Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that, when she was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. Her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when I think of great performances. Now, it will. She completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance. David Strathairn is fresh off of last year's ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", in which he gave one of 2005's best performances. Here, he gives yet another fine performanceeven though he is slightly underused. I was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only performance I have seen from Lili Taylor was that in ""The Haunting"" (1999). While most people ignored the movie, I found it to be an enjoyable, if not completely shallow, horror movie and I also have always thought that Taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally-distraught Nell. Here, Taylor gives yet another credible performance. She gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of Gretchen Mol.<br /><br />After everything was said and done, I realized that ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" cannot be compared to other biopics, such as ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Walk the Line"". It is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end. Her personal life is briefly implied, but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point. We watch the film knowing that Page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will havebut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life. She is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself. After all, she was an adult model turned Christian missionary. This movie does not over dramatize anything. It could have included fictitious moments of Page sobbing hysterically and begging God to forgive her. It could have shown Page running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of her pastand yet it does not. ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" tells a simple story and that is something rare by today's standards. Fortunately, it is quite refreshing.<br /><br />Final Thought: ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",1, the notorious bettie page   2005   directed by  mary harron  starring  gretchen mol  chris bauer  lili taylor  sarah paulson    david strathairn  mpaa rating   r   for nudity  sexual content and some language   it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life  from ray charles to johnny cash  biopics are very posh right now   the notorious bettie page  is the latest of these to be released on dvd  it features gretchen mol as the worlds most famous pin up model  bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color  unlike  ray    walk the line   and  finding neverland   however  this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year  this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie pages life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested  this does not mean  however  that it is a bad movie  in fact   the notorious bettie page  is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie  a solid work of cinema  this film focuses more on pages exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography  it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harrons direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about  everyone knows bettie page  played by mol   whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her  she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time  now  most people know her as one of americas first sex symbols  a legend to many models  especially those of playboy and other adult oriented magazines  she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and pages bondage style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar  in fact  the photos launched a full fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn  the performances in  the notorious bettie page  are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out  her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant  i understand that  when she was announced for the role  many people were skeptical  her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances  now  it will  she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance  david strathairn is fresh off of last years  good night  and good luck   in which he gave one of 2005s best performances  here  he gives yet another fine performanceeven though he is slightly underused  i was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie  the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in  the haunting   1999   while most people ignored the movie  i found it to be an enjoyable  if not completely shallow  horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally distraught nell  here  taylor gives yet another credible performance  she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen mol  after everything was said and done  i realized that  the notorious bettie page  cannot be compared to other biopics  such as  finding neverland  and  walk the line   it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career  from the beginning to the end  her personal life is briefly implied  but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point  we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will havebut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life  she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself  after all  she was an adult model turned christian missionary  this movie does not over dramatize anything  it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her  it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain  trying to escape the ghosts of her pastand yet it does not   the notorious bettie page  tells a simple story and that is something rare by todays standards  fortunately  it is quite refreshing  final thought   the notorious bettie page  is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography  overall rating  9 10  a 
"So, back when Herbie made his first appearance, I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones mug away. I only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations of a riveting/delightful story whenever I watch a movie, if I'm not on some sort of medication. And this is another good movie for the medicated. There are no major laughs, no complex plot lines, no difficult twists. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully loaded.<br /><br />This was the first time I had seen La Lohan on the screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was excellent in that), and I can't say I was terribly impressed this time around. Aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color, she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers. Her 'need for speed' wasn't portrayed consistently in the film - perhaps it was elsewhere - she looked older than her part, and seemed to always be looking for something (a party? designer togs? new place to spend money?) off set. I couldn't see any chemistry with Justin Long; that romance seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon, who I thought was appropriately over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy.<br /><br />It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies. If Disney had popped out with some Car 53 jewelry, I might have worn some just to be loyal. His new feature (?) was a little inconsistent (does he channel the thoughts of his driver? Does he now skateboard?) but whatever. We all knew how it was going to end, but I do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than Maggie. And my head still hurts from that lesson Maggie and we viewers had hammered home. <br /><br />What would have made the movie worthwhile? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot - at the very least, Herbie's as good as Lassie - but clearly that's asking too much. Why is it that Disney always goes back to the same well as ""Herbie Goes Bananas"" and ""the Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes"" when it comes to innovation? <br /><br />I'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations. For the rest of us....it's for when you have the 'flu and just can't take the suspense of Rear Window.",0,so  back when herbie made his first appearance  i was perfectly happy watching dean jones mug away  i only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn  now  unfortunately  i have expectations of a riveting delightful story whenever i watch a movie  if im not on some sort of medication  and this is another good movie for the medicated  there are no major laughs  no complex plot lines  no difficult twists  herbie fully loaded is great for the fully loaded  this was the first time i had seen la lohan on the screen since she swapped places with jamie lee curtis  i thought she was excellent in that   and i cant say i was terribly impressed this time around  aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color  she just didnt ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers  her need for speed wasnt portrayed consistently in the film   perhaps it was elsewhere   she looked older than her part  and seemed to always be looking for something  a party  designer togs  new place to spend money   off set  i couldnt see any chemistry with justin long  that romance seemed obligatory at best  the only time lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with matt dillon  who i thought was appropriately over the top as evil bad guy trip murphy  it was great to see herbie again  and i loved the movie intro with material from the old movies  if disney had popped out with some car 53 jewelry  i might have worn some just to be loyal  his new feature     was a little inconsistent  does he channel the thoughts of his driver  does he now skateboard   but whatever  we all knew how it was going to end  but i do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than maggie  and my head still hurts from that lesson maggie and we viewers had hammered home   what would have made the movie worthwhile  have the old herbie in a real story with a real plot   at the very least  herbies as good as lassie   but clearly thats asking too much  why is it that disney always goes back to the same well as  herbie goes bananas  and  the computer that wore tennis shoes  when it comes to innovation   im sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations  for the rest of us    its for when you have the flu and just cant take the suspense of rear window

This was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career.

"Alright, this film is the representation of several things. For starters, this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students. One student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries. The lead character is what several people who consider a 'loner/goth', despite the movie's stating of her not being so. She seems quite mysterious, but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom. She's questioned, due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before. Anyhow, she's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society. Yet, due to some, at first unexplained events, she spent roughly a year out of school, failing the grade. She has the desire to graduate, and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor, the girl in the hospital.<br /><br />These two leads are nearly entirely opposite, and they are quite that on a social level. While Alisha is a quiet, inwardly disturbed, anti-social 'goth' girl who spends her time entirely alone (even though she seems to read quite often, somewhat of a closet/out of the closet bookworm), the other girl is a rich, popular 'bubbly' girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world, ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive. I feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing MOST 'cliques' in the modern highschool, but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other. While the injured girl learns a deep, meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world, Alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing.<br /><br />Many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things. Either, a snobby, hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does, taking it out on an innocent girl, OR the story of a seemingly trapped, fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge, but that she is actually, perhaps, one of the most intelligent people she's known. In other words, people may see this film as a focus on Alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life, but it isn't about that.<br /><br />This film is about SEVERAL things. While it is about all I have stated, it is also representative of how people deal from a large, life-changing catastrophe. Truly, this movie is not very symbolic, but instead incredibly straight forward with its message, as long as you aren't afraid to open your mind, and your heart, to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously.<br /><br />Overall, this film is one of the best I've ever seen. The acting is brilliant, the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful, and the emotion flowing through-out this film will have anyone not only relating, but possibly crying. This film is by far heart-wrenching, and very impactful, and if I ever believed any film could alter a person's life... this would be the first that could have changed mine.<br /><br />I adored this movie, if you ever want a movie that's moving and impactful, while incredibly entertaining and REAL, watch this.",1,alright  this film is the representation of several things  for starters  this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students  one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries  the lead character is what several people who consider a loner goth  despite the movies stating of her not being so  she seems quite mysterious  but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom  shes questioned  due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before  anyhow  shes a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society  yet  due to some  at first unexplained events  she spent roughly a year out of school  failing the grade  she has the desire to graduate  and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor  the girl in the hospital  these two leads are nearly entirely opposite  and they are quite that on a social level  while alisha is a quiet  inwardly disturbed  anti social goth girl who spends her time entirely alone  even though she seems to read quite often  somewhat of a closet out of the closet bookworm   the other girl is a rich  popular bubbly girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world  ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive  i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most cliques in the modern highschool  but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other  while the injured girl learns a deep  meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world  alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing  many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things  either  a snobby  hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does  taking it out on an innocent girl  or the story of a seemingly trapped  fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge  but that she is actually  perhaps  one of the most intelligent people shes known  in other words  people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life  but it isnt about that  this film is about several things  while it is about all i have stated  it is also representative of how people deal from a large  life changing catastrophe  truly  this movie is not very symbolic  but instead incredibly straight forward with its message  as long as you arent afraid to open your mind  and your heart  to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously  overall  this film is one of the best ive ever seen  the acting is brilliant  the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful  and the emotion flowing through out this film will have anyone not only relating  but possibly crying  this film is by far heart wrenching  and very impactful  and if i ever believed any film could alter a persons life    this would be the first that could have changed mine  i adored this movie  if you ever want a movie thats moving and impactful  while incredibly entertaining and real  watch this

"I only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with Opening Night and that's Bergman';s Persona. Both movies are simply amazing, they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight. We have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl that declares her love for Myrtle and she is then hit by a car, leaves a deep mark in the actress. She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. The scene where she kill the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I found in a Cassavets film. The movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene, since Myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is genuine, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands absolutely amazing. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine.",1,i only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with opening night and thats bergman s persona  both movies are simply amazing  they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight  we have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress  myrtle gordon  gena rowlands   finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to  the accidental death of one of her fans  a young girl that declares her love for myrtle and she is then hit by a car  leaves a deep mark in the actress  she starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol  but that doesnt help to much and myrtle is one step away from complete madness  the scene where she kill the imaginary  or not  spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes i found in a cassavets film  the movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and gena rowlands improvise a scene  since myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately  this scene was filmed spontaneously  with a live audience  the laughter is genuine  the chemistry between casavates and rowlands absolutely amazing  if you liked persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine 
"...in our household. Like everyone else who has commented on this movie, my brothers (7 & 4 years old at the time) and I (10) would watch this movie over and over again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure. We all loved the Camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song. There are some slow moments (the time spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) and we generally got bored after The Knight's song (""The reason that I {sound effect} is because I loooooove you""), but we loved the journey to rescue Babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of King Koo-Koo floating there dominating the entire horizon, laughing maniacally at the end. I still to this day sing ""Hooray for me! Babbette of gay Paris!"" around my friends (I'm 33 now) who just look at me as if I've lost my mind; however, when I'm singing it I'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of Star Wars.",1,   in our household  like everyone else who has commented on this movie  my brothers  7   4 years old at the time  and i  10  would watch this movie over and over again  we all loved star wars  but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure  we all loved the camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song  there are some slow moments  the time spent with king koo koo in his court  and we generally got bored after the knights song   the reason that i  sound effect  is because i loooooove you    but we loved the journey to rescue babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king koo koo floating there dominating the entire horizon  laughing maniacally at the end  i still to this day sing  hooray for me  babbette of gay paris   around my friends  im 33 now  who just look at me as if ive lost my mind  however  when im singing it im 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars 
"I loved this movie. Great storyline and actors and good movie sets. It told the story in a way I can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can not find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack. Other than not being able to find the soundtrack I thought the movie was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is some of his best work. His past movies were OK, but this one really told a story for a change. This will go down in history as being one of the best TV films ever aired. Congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work.",1,i loved this movie  great storyline and actors and good movie sets  it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep  i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack  i can not find it anywhere  please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack  other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating  swayze did a great job  i think this is some of his best work  his past movies were ok  but this one really told a story for a change  this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired  congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work 
"Japan is in serious trouble. Demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will. On top of that, the rebirth of Ashura, Queen of the demons, is nigh. The only thing that stands against this grave threat are the Demon Wardens, a fearsome group of warriors, who might just be as bad as the demons themselves.<br /><br />Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago, took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child (In a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn). One night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes intertwine (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies.<br /><br />If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy/Swordplay epic, you'd be wrong. In fact, there's nothing typical about Ashura. It is a hodge-podge of many different genre's of film. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre's fairly respectfully (Although, the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous, but really fun popcorn movie.<br /><br />To be sure, there are flaws in the film. Some of the humor seems contrived, and out of place. And the acting isn't the greatest. But seriously, do you watch Fantasy/Swordplay/Comedy films for the great acting performances?? No, we watch them for the action and the crazy CG visuals, all of which Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy.<br /><br />Bottom line; the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic, but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action. The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick.<br /><br />My Rating 7 out of 10.

"Interesting how much more realistic Brosnan's performance is to that of the original James Bond novels when compared to the bond films. He's neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot. This is perfect break for him, even so much as to make fun of the bond icon. ""I'm a mess, a parody of myself"" he says. It doesn't get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is very much how Ian Fleming had portrayed James Bond. Personally I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he fit the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character with, as compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. Its great to see Brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall. A shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with. It's an impressive portrayal, and having Greg Kinear to ground him, is just poetic. This movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in ""My Blue Heaven"", but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.",1,interesting how much more realistic brosnans performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films  hes neurotic  paranoid  an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot  this is perfect break for him  even so much as to make fun of the bond icon   im a mess  a parody of myself  he says  it doesnt get any better than that  i just finished reading dr no and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond  personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely  there was nothing for him to personalize the character with  as compared to roger moore or sean connery  its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall  a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with  its an impressive portrayal  and having greg kinear to ground him  is just poetic  this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in  my blue heaven   but more genuine in their coping mechanisms 
"When I saw this at a shop I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek meets Texas chainsaw massacre, and I mean it only cost three quid (around $6). To be honest I don't think it was even worth that.<br /><br />It seemed like the directors- the 'butcher brothers' couldn't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror. It ended up with a cliché ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasn't needed.<br /><br />The only good part really was the middle/end- I won't ruin it for you. But that was the only ""good ""part.<br /><br />Overall a pointless watch. It felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes. If you want an artsy film-don't bother. If you want a slasher movie- don't bother- The film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening.",0,when i saw this at a shop i thought it looked really good and original  like wolfs creek meets texas chainsaw massacre  and i mean it only cost three quid  around  6   to be honest i dont think it was even worth that  it seemed like the directors  the butcher brothers couldnt decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror  it ended up with a cliché ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldnt care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasnt needed  the only good part really was the middle end  i wont ruin it for you  but that was the only  good  part  overall a pointless watch  it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes  if you want an artsy film dont bother  if you want a slasher movie  dont bother  the film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening 
"Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them. If at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through, the reader may be a little scared, but he'll also think, ""Well, I can deal with that. At least it wasn't a HUNDRED feet tall."" There's nothing more frightening than what lurks, unseen and unknown, just on the other side of that tightly closed door, waiting to get you.<br /><br />THE HAUNTING is so completely misconceived that director Jan De Bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling: ""Look, everybody, look! It's a ten-foot-tall bug! Isn't that SCARY?!"" The law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in. By the end of the movie, the director is, so to speak, jumping up and down, banging his CGI pots and pans madly, and hoarsely screaming: ""Look, everyone, look! Here come ten HUNDRED-foot-tall bugs! ... And now, here come a hundred THOUSAND-foot-tall bugs!"" <br /><br />The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor (and there are many). They can't and don't. In fact, impressive as they are, the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them -- whether in admiration or annoyance -- instead of being immersed in a story.<br /><br />For me, the nadir of this film's sheer stupidity comes when a statue, with ""blood"" gushing from its mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Marrow) in a fountain. The filmmakers clearly didn't know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it, so they just have Neeson thrash around in the water a bit, flailing his arms and going glug-glug. By the next scene, the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and, ho hum, forgotten all about the annoying incident.<br /><br />Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been dumbed-down into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of low-IQ teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder: ""Okay, next, let's, uh, make the ceiling, you know, look like a creepy face, and, uh, come down on her ... and all these spiky things, like, trap her in the bed.""<br /><br />The sole saving grace of THE HAUNTING is that it at last becomes so awful that it's actually funny. By the time Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell on the floor and then went on his Magic-Carpet Ride O' Death, I just about fell on the floor myself, laughing.<br /><br />Badly constructed, witless, grotesquely heavy-handed, utterly unbelievable, and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes, this vacuous HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie.",0,somewhere in his non fiction book danse macabre  stephen king suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them  if at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through  the reader may be a little scared  but hell also think   well  i can deal with that  at least it wasnt a hundred feet tall   theres nothing more frightening than what lurks  unseen and unknown  just on the other side of that tightly closed door  waiting to get you  the haunting is so completely misconceived that director jan de bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling   look  everybody  look  its a ten foot tall bug  isnt that scary    the law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in  by the end of the movie  the director is  so to speak  jumping up and down  banging his cgi pots and pans madly  and hoarsely screaming   look  everyone  look  here come ten hundred foot tall bugs      and now  here come a hundred thousand foot tall bugs    the filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor  and there are many   they cant and dont  in fact  impressive as they are  the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them    whether in admiration or annoyance    instead of being immersed in a story  for me  the nadir of this films sheer stupidity comes when a statue  with  blood  gushing from its mouth  tries to drown liam neeson  as dr  marrow  in a fountain  the filmmakers clearly didnt know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it  so they just have neeson thrash around in the water a bit  flailing his arms and going glug glug  by the next scene  the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and  ho hum  forgotten all about the annoying incident  shirley jacksons novel seems to have been dumbed down into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of low iq teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder   okay  next  lets  uh  make the ceiling  you know  look like a creepy face  and  uh  come down on her     and all these spiky things  like  trap her in the bed   the sole saving grace of the haunting is that it at last becomes so awful that its actually funny  by the time owen wilson  as luke sanderson  fell on the floor and then went on his magic carpet ride o death  i just about fell on the floor myself  laughing  badly constructed  witless  grotesquely heavy handed  utterly unbelievable  and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes  this vacuous haunting is a textbook example of how not to make a horror movie 
"I took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making. I always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies, especially as I'm such a cynic myself. It's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the ""been there, done that"" approach to every movie she sees. I'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother / daughter evening out. Far, far better than going to see some brain dead ""chick flick"", which I gather is what we are supposed to enjoy, according to the demographics? <br /><br />Eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of Paris, a city I haven't visited in 20 years. But I wish I had. They are loosely linked by joining shots, and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world. Some of the films work better than others but, as other reviewers have said, it never descends too far into kitsch. Some are funny, some are sad, some intriguing and some just plain puzzling (I'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the ""Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" hairdressing salon.) Some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning (the vampire and the tourist for example.) Possibly my only criticism of the whole film, is that it makes Paris look too good. It can also be cold, wet, foggy, indifferent and miserable, or, in summer, baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction. But I'm nit picking. <br /><br />My personal favourite by far was the Coen brothers film shot on the Tuileries Metro station, and starring a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers' tiff. Absolutely perfect, and very, very funny, without Buscemi having to say a word. I also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists, which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch, but it just stayed on the right side. Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with Oscar Wilde's tomb left me pretty indifferent, and Juliette Binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very, very uncomfortable. I thought both the Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent piece, and Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands fell a bit flat, but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good (has she cornered the market in junkies? I watched Sherry Baby last week.) <br /><br />But I felt the two ""social justice"" pieces (for want of a better way of putting it), worked very well. By that, I mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town. And then the film about the African migrant, struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society, who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young, new paramedic. Yet another murder statistic, in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life, every year. I thought both pieces very well observed.<br /><br />The final film, 14th Arrondissement, in which Margo Martindale plays a postal worker from Colorado recounting the story of her first trip to Paris  in very badly accented French  to her night school French class, moved me. A perfect ending, to a good, intriguing if not quite great, movie. <br /><br />Paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea, but it works pretty well.",1,i took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making  i always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies  especially as im such a cynic myself  its good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasnt yet reached the  been there  done that  approach to every movie she sees  im pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother   daughter evening out  far  far better than going to see some brain dead  chick flick   which i gather is what we are supposed to enjoy  according to the demographics   eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of paris  a city i havent visited in 20 years  but i wish i had  they are loosely linked by joining shots  and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world  some of the films work better than others but  as other reviewers have said  it never descends too far into kitsch  some are funny  some are sad  some intriguing and some just plain puzzling  im still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the  flying tiger  hidden dragon  hairdressing salon   some are just fun and perhaps shouldnt be assigned too much meaning  the vampire and the tourist for example   possibly my only criticism of the whole film  is that it makes paris look too good  it can also be cold  wet  foggy  indifferent and miserable  or  in summer  baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction  but im nit picking   my personal favourite by far was the coen brothers film shot on the tuileries metro station  and starring a perfectly cast steve buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers tiff  absolutely perfect  and very  very funny  without buscemi having to say a word  i also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists  which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy   that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch  but it just stayed on the right side  rufus sewell and emily mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with oscar wildes tomb left me pretty indifferent  and juliette binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very  very uncomfortable  i thought both the bob hoskins   fanny ardent piece  and ben gazzara   gena rowlands fell a bit flat  but maggie gyllenhaal was good  has she cornered the market in junkies  i watched sherry baby last week    but i felt the two  social justice  pieces  for want of a better way of putting it   worked very well  by that  i mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone elses baby across town  and then the film about the african migrant  struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society  who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young  new paramedic  yet another murder statistic  in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life  every year  i thought both pieces very well observed  the final film  14th arrondissement  in which margo martindale plays a postal worker from colorado recounting the story of her first trip to paris  in very badly accented french  to her night school french class  moved me  a perfect ending  to a good  intriguing if not quite great  movie   paris je taime was an ambitious idea  but it works pretty well 
"Well, I am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on DVD. When that will happen, I don't know, but I will grab it when it's released.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett's ring career begins in the film. Then it goes from a good film to a great one.<br /><br />Few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as Flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that. Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe that. You can just sense how much fun he was having here. Ward Bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, was never better.<br /><br />There is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done, too. Corbett's family is fun to watch, too, as they carry on in the stands during Jim's matches. Out of the arena, Corbett's family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.<br /><br />And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some mean-spirited critics (Variety, for example) didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not. And, in this case, it made for a nice story and nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman, not anything like Flynn's portrayal, but Flynn still make him a good guy.)<br /><br />This is one of the more entertaining classic films I have ever watched and I eagerly wait for the DVD.",1,well  i am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on dvd  when that will happen  i dont know  but i will grab it when its released  in my humble opinion  this is errol flynns most entertaining film  especially when  gentleman jim  corbetts ring career begins in the film  then it goes from a good film to a great one  few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that  reportedly  this was flynns favorite role and i believe that  you can just sense how much fun he was having here  ward bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous john l  sullivan  bond  too  was never better  there is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done  too  corbetts family is fun to watch  too  as they carry on in the stands during jims matches  out of the arena  corbetts familys constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion  and speaking of the conclusion  sullivans speech to corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film  some mean spirited critics  variety  for example  didnt like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but   duh   most films are fictionalized  like it or not  and  in this case  it made for a nice story and nice ending   in real life  corbett was a very soft spoken true gentleman  not anything like flynns portrayal  but flynn still make him a good guy   this is one of the more entertaining classic films i have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd 
"after just having watched The Deer Hunter,which is a masterpiece,the movie Jacknife had big shoes to fill.it has same themes as The Deer Hunter,the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War.Robert De Niro is in this film,as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here,as is Kathy Baker.but this movie belongs to Ed Harris,who gives a powerful,emotional and impactful performance.the movie is based on a stage play,and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me.by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play.that was not that big a deal,and doesn't really diminish the film.i actually really liked this movie.it's not an epic like The Deer Hunter.they are about similar era and have similar themes,but they are two very different films.i thought The Deer Hunter was great,and i also think this movie was great.it's the acting in this one that makes it so great.for me,Jacknife is a 10/10",1,after just having watched the deer hunter which is a masterpiece the movie jacknife had big shoes to fill it has same themes as the deer hunter the devastating effects on a person after the vietnam war robert de niro is in this film as in the deer hunter and is very good here as is kathy baker but this movie belongs to ed harris who gives a powerful emotional and impactful performance the movie is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play that was not that big a deal and doesnt really diminish the film i actually really liked this movie its not an epic like the deer hunter they are about similar era and have similar themes but they are two very different films i thought the deer hunter was great and i also think this movie was great its the acting in this one that makes it so great for me jacknife is a 10 10
"When i saw the preview for this on TV i was thinking, ""ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie"" but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good, plot was horrible, the military bid was just plain stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap. The movie made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf, instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out. If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies, there all positive, but this one is not simply because the story was terrible. One out of 10 max. Im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick, but i bet you didn't expect this. Beyond Loch Nes was way better than this movie, heck, any movie thats on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.",0,when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking   ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie  but it was not  it was not scary at all  acting was good  plot was horrible  the military bid was just plain stupid  i think the sci fi channel could of done better than this piece of crap  the movie made it sound like arron was going to turn into a werewolf  instead he turned psycho and bit some doctors throat out  if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies  there all positive  but this one is not simply because the story was terrible  one out of 10 max  im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick  but i bet you didnt expect this  beyond loch nes was way better than this movie  heck  any movie thats on the sci fi channel is better than this movie 
"This has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. Starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the Daytime Awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer, under phony smiles. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. Ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way. This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher. While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives, she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark. Not a huge follower, but if I run across an episode I'd watch it. Robert Downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic David Seaton Barnes, the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead.<br /><br />Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. Here, all she has to do is scream ""I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP!"" or give one of her anti-Celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles. Yes, Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne. Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70-MM-sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor, but like a caterpillar in a cocoon, the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy, serious roles, that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen.<br /><br />How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher, if only for a glorified cameo. She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. She takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself.<br /><br />How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! At the time, she wasn't really known for much. Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute (yes, I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price), but she didn't hold my attention - - much. But here, she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who, of course, turns out to be the niece's father, and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother.<br /><br />I'll stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela. If you've seen it, then reminisce. If you haven't, you've missed a real classic, but not really. The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell.",1,this has to be  hands down  hats off  one of the most uproarious comedies ever made  starting with the animated blowing  popping bubbles  the entrance to the daytime awards  the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet  the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech  the venomous comments uttered by the actors jealous co stars and producer  under phony smiles  now that is only in the first few minutes  then  all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous  ridiculous in a good way  no  make that a great way  this was the first time id seen the always charming teri hatcher  while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives  she herself is always watchable   same goes for lois   clark  not a huge follower  but if i run across an episode id watch it  robert downey  jr   does a great turn as slimy  smarmy  snaky  sycophantic david seaton barnes  the producer whod give his right eye to see sally fields celeste talbert leave the show  if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriartys montana moorehead  moriarty absolutely shines in this movie  just as she had everywhere else shes appeared  here  all she has to do is scream  i hate you i hate you you creep   or give one of her anti celeste co conspirators an evil grin  and she has me rolling in the aisles  yes  cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress  and one hell of a comedienne  sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70 mm sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies  and were all reminded why she is who she is today  having started off in comedy afraid of nothing  her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor  but like a caterpillar in a cocoon  the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was  the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy  serious roles  that you associate them with their character and you cant believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen  how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher  if only for a glorified cameo  she doesnt realize what a presence she bears on screen  she takes a role which  in the hands of a lesser actress  could easily have been forgotten  but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself  how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this  at the time  she wasnt really known for much  adventures in babysitting was kind of cute  yes  i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price   but she didnt hold my attention     much  but here  she makes the most of her character   stars niece who falls in love with the stars ex co star and lover who  of course  turns out to be the nieces father  and the star turns out to be the poor girls mother  ill stop there   i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy  or at least a novela  if youve seen it  then reminisce  if you havent  youve missed a real classic  but not really  the dvds are made of a material thatll last for at least 25 years  and this movie is timeless  so what the hell 
"I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren. I'm a person who they call a Cultural Barbarian. I hate art in any kind of shape or form. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kills, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing of the kind. Let me give you a résumé in a few sentences. It starts out with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an anti fascist and a caretaker. The housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets the anti fascist. She falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the anti fascist is gay. Despite of this they make love with each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents. The end. You want an even shorter résumé? BORING... That short enough? The guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself, to save the audience from this atrocity. On a side note my sister loved this movie.

"The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, nearly perfect. A Lady and the Tramp storyline in two senses--rich girl/poor boy, and ability vs. bloodline. The sequel, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous, overblown Disneyfied mess best summarized as ""Rambo Meets the Black Stallion."" Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence, and suddenly he's Superman on horseback; in the original, good film, he was real and believable, but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I've hardly been as disappointed in a movie, and at times this thing made me quite angry--they missed hardly a cliché. Brazen audience manipulation--do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them, to make them happy?

"I don't like ""grade inflation"" but I just had to give this a 10. I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure that the Hollywood remake that someone told me about, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that I am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved, or its setting changed to a different culture.<br /><br />A story I found worth watching, and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort!

"I love the newer episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the storyline with Kate falling for the principal. I want to find out what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family next. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it is a credit to his acting that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and totally believe in him as Kate's Dad. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written into the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitively and lovingly dealt with.

"This has got to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I ran out to purchase the DVD once it was released...what a tragic mistake! I won't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow. I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis so I am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level. It is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible...if that was their goal, they suceeded.

"First of all, the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being ""altered"". Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either. Well enough ranting. This is a very beautiful film. The backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and up to the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like I imagined they would. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes, but Aragorn looks AWESOME. The film has a great score that completely supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading (the books are even better) give this movie a try, keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago.<br /><br />Also of particular note: Peter Jackson's adaption of Fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as Ralph Bakshi's (Jackson has said many times how much he admired Bakshi's effort).",1,first of all  the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they cant stand a few parts of the true story being  altered   well guess what  peter jacksons film wasnt a perfect rendition either  well enough ranting  this is a very beautiful film  the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists  the film covers about half the trilogy  fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers  and moves at a good pace  the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would  samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes  but aragorn looks awesome  the film has a great score that completely supports the movie  if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading  the books are even better  give this movie a try  keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago  also of particular note  peter jacksons adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshis  jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshis effort  
"This movie deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film, and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp, moralistic, and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable, unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl.<br /><br />Most likely two types of people will see this, francophiles or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the latter, I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby, disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.",0,this movie deserves credit for its original approach  it combines elements of theater  film  and epic storytelling  unfortunately  it falls flat on all levels  the films biggest weakness is its unwillingness to commit to anything  it has camp  moralistic  and epic elements without ever committing to any of them  as for the story itself  chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable  unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl  most likely two types of people will see this  francophiles or arthuriophiles  speaking as one of the latter  i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby  disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story 
"""It's all up to you, Ed?"" ""Now you get to play the game."" The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend, on opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was but fourteen years old. I wasn't even entirely sure what I was seeing, but I will never forgot it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty.<br /><br />Watching it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me quivers.<br /><br />My father was a huge Burt Reynolds fan, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie.' I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this: ""Grand Prix"" and ""The Song of Norway."" Well this wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shell-shocked.<br /><br />But even at that tender age, I appreciated the artistry...and after seeing again today, am I surprised I was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing, yet extremely well-crafted film.<br /><br />Suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend. I don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness.<br /><br />As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making.<br /><br />Burt Reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job. The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. The photography, cinematography...all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.<br /><br />The moral questions raised, from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. And the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering. These four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror.<br /><br />It's a classic to be sure. And the phrase ""you have a pretty mouth"" has been quoted endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture...as much as ""Make my day"" or ""I'll be back"" ever were.<br /><br />So what would YOU do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city, cozy bed, wife and kids? And if you took the measures Burt Reynolds did (and I would have done the same) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake, or stand trial and take your chances? The bottom line is: Deliverance delivers. You can take that to the bank. If this movie doesn't get under your skin, then you are not human.<br /><br />Even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film remains the same: Ed failing to kill the deer...then changing. Life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man. And I suppose that's what this film is all about Jon Voight, in particular, as Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, his acting lifts the movie to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right It needs to be seen to be believed. I guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.<br /><br />Briskly paced, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string, this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today. Times have changes, but our choices as human beings have not.<br /><br />Ten out of ten stars.",1, its all up to you  ed    now you get to play the game   the day my father left my mother  he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend  on opening day at the cinerama dome in hollywood  i was but fourteen years old  i wasnt even entirely sure what i was seeing  but i will never forgot it  especially the scene with ned beatty  watching it today  thirty six years later  it still gives me quivers  my father was a huge burt reynolds fan  hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an action movie  i had seen two films at the dome prior to this   grand prix  and  the song of norway   well this wasnt exactly mario andretti or the brady bunch  after leaving the theater  i was shell shocked  but even at that tender age  i appreciated the artistry   and after seeing again today  am i surprised i was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing  yet extremely well crafted film  suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend  i dont blame my father for taking me  but it was a bit much for a child to witness  as an adult  i still find it quite disturbing  yet i am still very impressed with the quality of the film making  burt reynolds as an absolute wonder  as are all the principles   from billy redden as the inbred guitar wonder  to ronny cox as the terrified insurance salesman   everyone does an admirable job  the sound quality is second to none  from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks  the photography  cinematography   all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate  the moral questions raised  from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being  remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released  and the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life altering  these four men  city men  suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined  raise the bar from action to horror  its a classic to be sure  and the phrase  you have a pretty mouth  has been quoted endlessly  from saturday night live to off the cuff comments around water cooler at work  this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture   as much as  make my day  or  ill be back  ever were  so what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city  cozy bed  wife and kids  and if you took the measures burt reynolds did  and i would have done the same  would you bury the body beneath the soon to be lake  or stand trial and take your chances  the bottom line is  deliverance delivers  you can take that to the bank  if this movie doesnt get under your skin  then you are not human  even if you have seen this before  rent it again and ask yourself the above question  my favorite part of the film remains the same  ed failing to kill the deer   then changing  life and its unpredictable circumstance can change a man  and i suppose thats what this film is all about jon voight  in particular  as ed  gives the best performance here  and he remains one of the more gifted actors in hollywood history  from midnight cowboy to his highly underrated performance as franklin d  roosevelt in pearl harbor  his acting lifts the movie to another level  climbing the rocks at dusk  terrified and determined to make it right it needs to be seen to be believed  i guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level  briskly paced  tense  taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string  this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today  times have changes  but our choices as human beings have not  ten out of ten stars 
"She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she also is a perennial Razzie nominee. To do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money.

"""Piece is Cake"" is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the (admittedly fictional) pilots it portrays. It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />In the March 1989 ""Aeroplane Monthly"", Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV mini-series. A few of his comments are worth repeating:<br /><br />""There was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that I saw in action, and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'Piece of Cake'. It would not have been tolerated for a moment... ...The prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club, though with more discipline. Nor was there any sense of 'death or glory'. RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we were required to do it - no more and no less.<br /><br />""There was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice'. People either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did. But we knew fear, recognised it in ourselves and in each other, did our damnedness to control it, and then got on with the job...<br /><br />""...I could feel no 'glory', but there was a sense of greatness, and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'Piece of Cake'.""<br /><br />Beamont was, in his own words, ""a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the recent TV series, was there at the time"".<br /><br />Beamont served with 87 Squadron both in France and the BoB, before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the Typhoon and Tempest, and a post-war test pilot.<br /><br />""Piece of Cake"" is an absolute, total misrepresentation of the way pilots in Fighter Command acted at the time.

"What's happening to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Has he run out of creative ideas? If he has, time to take a back seat. Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?), guess Heeru wouldn't sound that great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) doesn't exists at all. In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha.

"I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories, bad camera work and a walk-thru persona, he nearly lost me. A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he's forgotten again. This film is seriously dark (on any level you care to name). There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it's meant as a warning against the military.<br /><br />Seagall may have had a stand-in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place. Okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner? Anyway this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused. There's lots of gore if you like that king of thing. It looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time. I'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their hapless victims. I harken you back to my summary.

"I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You've got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time.

"I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives. Also, the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.",1,i saw brothers shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it  judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son  the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn  he shows up there because his brother has died  and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brothers wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family  the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives  also  the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait 
"JACKNIFE is a fine adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's play 'Strange Snow' (the screenplay was also written by Metcalfe), sensitively directed by David Hugh Jones, that explores the too frequently forgotten effect of battle on veterans damaged permanently by the heinous cruelties of war. It is especially poignant to return to this 1989 film now as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the raw treatment they are receiving in our Veterans' Hospitals.<br /><br />Three friends went off to the Vietnam War together and only two returned alive: the problem is that while both men suffered in battle the one David 'Highschool' Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so severely damaged by posttraumatic stress syndrome that he 'exists' in a drunken vacuum with his very plain schoolteacher sister Martha (Kathy Baker). As David deteriorates his buddy Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the town in an attempt to help his friend. In the course of events Jacknife at first offers succor to Martha and eventually the two date - at a Prom Martha must attend - and at that prom drunken David completely falls apart, destroying relics in the school and terrifying the townspeople and students. Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their buddy and in doing so brings David to the point where he can begin his climb toward recovery. And the long-suffering Martha finds her needs tended by Jacknife, too.<br /><br />All three actors give astonishingly fine performances: Ed Harris offers one of his most fully realized roles while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers. More people should help resurrect this all but forgotten film as it is a brittle reminder of the damages our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them after battle's end.

"The concept for Sarafina appears to be a sound one, that is aside from the musical perspective. It attempts to combine upbeat African music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror. Had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film, however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs. <br /><br />Aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, Goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast.

"The story of the boy thief of Bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of ""Thief of Bagdad,"" to less imposing, more recent attempts. The best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. Those effects still work their charm.<br /><br />No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.<br /><br />Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.<br /><br />Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)<br /><br />Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see ""Thief of Bagdad.""<br /><br />This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. It was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.<br /><br />""Thief of Bagdad"" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases.

"High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school. As they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge, the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission.<br /><br />There is another similar movie like this, called ""Elephant."" Why do I bring this up? To compare the two films, of course. I have to say, even though I liked ""Elephant,"" this is a much better film. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, this is shot differently, much along the lines of ""Cloverfield,"" ""Blair Witch Project,"" and ""Diary of the Dead."" This makes the movie all the better because it's much more painfully realistic.<br /><br />But what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the ""other side of the story."" You get to know these two shooters, unlike ""Elephant."" I actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white.<br /><br />To be honest, this is why I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions. You get to understand them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention.

"This movie stinks! You will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it. Sliding Doors, w/ Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda tries to do much much MUCH better. That movie was clever, witty, and well-acted. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths -- or rather the characters she played -- and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic.<br /><br />Where as Melinda & Melinda is tiresome, the dialogue is contrived and I could have cared less about any of these people -- least of all Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional -- her first glass of wine is at 10 a.m. -- and so melodramatic she is laughable, and not in the comedic sense. The 2nd Melinda is fine, but forgettable.<br /><br />Woody Allen's previous ensemble movies worked because, I'm guessing, he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months: you can tell. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented -- those around her are not, not enough to be a whole presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can't quite remember which ones.<br /><br />Sad, very sad.",0,this movie stinks  you will want back the two plus hours it takes to get through it  sliding doors  w  gwyenth paltrow and directed by peter howit  did what melinda   melinda tries to do much much much better  that movie was clever  witty  and well acted  i cared about what happened to both gwyenths    or rather the characters she played    and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic  where as melinda   melinda is tiresome  the dialogue is contrived and i could have cared less about any of these people    least of all melinda  one melinda is so dysfunctional    her first glass of wine is at 10 a m     and so melodramatic she is laughable  and not in the comedic sense  the 2nd melinda is fine  but forgettable  woody allens previous ensemble movies worked because  im guessing  he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented  one piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months  you can tell  and while chloe sevigny is talented    those around her are not  not enough to be a whole presence  the movie ends up being chloe sevigny and a bunch of other people you know youve seen in other movies but cant quite remember which ones  sad  very sad 
"What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. They would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) Except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. Luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.<br /><br />And alas, the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. And the ""haha, we're so clever, aren't we?"" way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one. Sigh...<br /><br />Instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman', or even to a lesser extent 'Sleepy Hollow', and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.",0,what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time  well  he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that couldve been directed by anybody available out of film school   and in fact  they probably wouldve done a better job  they wouldve at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script  mark wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes   gasp   except this time around  the apes squirm through groan worthy dialogue  nonsensical plotting  and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money couldve been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered masterpiece next to this tripe  as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth  his performance as evil ape leader thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing  luckily for him  the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles  and alas  the always dependable hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause  and the  haha  were so clever  arent we   way that hollywood intermingles references from the original pota into this one  sigh    instead of seeing this  spend the night in and call up some friends and rent ed wood  edward scissorhands  batman  or even to a lesser extent sleepy hollow  and reminisce about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality   not shame and ridicule 
I gave this a 1. There are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for. Total mayhem. Everyone gets killed or nearly so. I am tired of cross hairs and changing views.

"I am normally not compelled to write a review for a film, but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair, so I feel it necessary to share my point of view.<br /><br />""Krisana"" (or as it was titled at the theater I saw it, ""Fallen"") follows Matiss, a lonely Latvian archivist, as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn't try to stop from jumping off a bridge, as well as her reasons for doing so. That's the plot in a nutshell, but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act. As a detective who investigates the incident tells him, we usually don't bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die.<br /><br />Comparisons to Michaelango Antonioni and his ""Blowup"" will most likely abound in any review you read about ""Krisana."" The influence of Antonioni's philosophical and austere style and the story of ""Blowup"" are clear and, in fact, writer/director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which Matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge, or at least who he thinks did.<br /><br />The only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the ""college film class"" look and sound of the film. He or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist Latvian film most likely faces, but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of Matiss. The background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a Fellini film, whether or not that was Kelemen's intention. The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this constraint is used to the film's advantage.<br /><br />""Krisana"" succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-serious. It could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story, but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned with plot, this film and its ending may frustrate you. Otherwise, take the time to be engaged by it.

"I have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the U.S. Government's yearly demand for taxes. Ever read a tax code?: it is quite a trial to follow it's multiple clauses that our congressmen and senators push in to help their financial backers and various interest groups. Despite claims that it is fair, the tax code has always laid the lion share of the burden on the middle and working classes rather than the rich and influential. Most of the various special clauses are meant for their use - go through the average 1040 or 1040A form and look at the variety of different investment and business ventures all of which have a different set of rules. Most people will never have any use for these.<br /><br />The story here is that a wealthy landowner (Philip Ober) uses his influence to tip off the IRS that his neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle) have not payed taxes in 20 years. The Baltimore office of the IRS is under Fred Clarke, and he is snapping to attention for Ober with his influence. He sends Tony Randall to check out the situation.<br /><br />Randall finds that Douglas, Merkle, and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people, who rarely have need for cash (they get along on their farm produce and barter with their neighbors). But Randall, trained in the clear (to the IRS) lines of the tax code tries to pin down the family to fundamentals. But gradually Douglas notes that Reynolds is fond of Randall, and he keeps sidetracking Randall from his chore, eventually getting him drunk. He also makes it difficult for Randall to leave by having the motor of his car removed ""for repairs"" by his two sons.<br /><br />The plot follows the growing attraction and frictions between urban, vaguely ambitious Randall, and countryside, life loving Reynolds. They make a cute couple actually. Eventually, after Ober complains, Randall is sent back in disgrace and Clarke (a tougher cookie) gets down to brass tacks. And comes up with a very large tax bill, that will possibly ruin Douglas's family.<br /><br />The film does not end there - it does end happily, but it does remind us that the power to tax is the power to destroy, and that the Government does, all too frequently, go in for destruction. A chance in a million reversal saves the family, but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick. More realistic is how Clarke's boss, (Charles Lane) cuts to the essence regarding Ober's ""help"" by suggesting that next year his taxes will be looked at more carefully. After that Ober is rather green.",1,i have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the u s  governments yearly demand for taxes  ever read a tax code   it is quite a trial to follow its multiple clauses that our congressmen and senators push in to help their financial backers and various interest groups  despite claims that it is fair  the tax code has always laid the lion share of the burden on the middle and working classes rather than the rich and influential  most of the various special clauses are meant for their use   go through the average 1040 or 1040a form and look at the variety of different investment and business ventures all of which have a different set of rules  most people will never have any use for these  the story here is that a wealthy landowner  philip ober  uses his influence to tip off the irs that his neighbors  paul douglas and una merkle  have not payed taxes in 20 years  the baltimore office of the irs is under fred clarke  and he is snapping to attention for ober with his influence  he sends tony randall to check out the situation  randall finds that douglas  merkle  and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people  who rarely have need for cash  they get along on their farm produce and barter with their neighbors   but randall  trained in the clear  to the irs  lines of the tax code tries to pin down the family to fundamentals  but gradually douglas notes that reynolds is fond of randall  and he keeps sidetracking randall from his chore  eventually getting him drunk  he also makes it difficult for randall to leave by having the motor of his car removed  for repairs  by his two sons  the plot follows the growing attraction and frictions between urban  vaguely ambitious randall  and countryside  life loving reynolds  they make a cute couple actually  eventually  after ober complains  randall is sent back in disgrace and clarke  a tougher cookie  gets down to brass tacks  and comes up with a very large tax bill  that will possibly ruin douglass family  the film does not end there   it does end happily  but it does remind us that the power to tax is the power to destroy  and that the government does  all too frequently  go in for destruction  a chance in a million reversal saves the family  but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick  more realistic is how clarkes boss   charles lane  cuts to the essence regarding obers  help  by suggesting that next year his taxes will be looked at more carefully  after that ober is rather green 
"I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie, as I didn't think it was going to be well done. The kids, ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it, so I caved. I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought, but was still a far cry from the book. The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place. I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the ""silly"" or ""stupid"" choices.",0,i was dreading taking my nephews to this movie  as i didnt think it was going to be well done  the kids  ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it  so i caved  i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought  but was still a far cry from the book  the movie seemed right on with the 10 year olds understanding and sense of humor  i found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place  i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies dont show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the  silly  or  stupid  choices 
"I tried twice to get through this film, succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a great DVD transfer. The problem? It's simply too boring.<br /><br />If you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene, which takes up most of the second half of the film, you have it made, but it's tough getting to that point. There are some interesting talks by ""Abraham Lincoln"" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The ending is touching as Lincoln walks off and they superimpose his Memoral statue over the screen.<br /><br />It's a nice story, well-acted and such....but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there. I suspect the real Abe Lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film.",0,i tried twice to get through this film  succeeding the first time   and it was like pulling teeth   and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer  the problem  its simply too boring  if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene  which takes up most of the second half of the film  you have it made  but its tough getting to that point  there are some interesting talks by  abraham lincoln   henry fonda  during the trial  the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screen  its a nice story  well acted and such    but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there  i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film 
"A small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store, and picking stuff just because I haven't seen it. A large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen.<br /><br />Long before Elia Kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies (not good ones), he made this better than average drama. Watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated. Contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous. Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. (um. No thanks) <br /><br />His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot. The plague is coming! But here's an atypical Richard Widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable Barabra bel Geddes, with her bathos turned way down (well, for her); they're a couple and they share some nicely-written scenes about big crises and smaller ones. Here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships-crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment. These are the small-scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something Hollywood, in its greed, now studiously avoids. These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. It's a personable, human-scaled film, not the grotesque, overscaled production that he and others (David Lean) will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />I just watched it twice and I'll be damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is seeking in the final scenes, but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer. This reminds me of both No Way Out a Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain, and Naked City, which you should really get your hands on.",1,a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store  and picking stuff just because i havent seen it  a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen  long before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies  not good ones   he made this better than average drama  watching it you begin to notice how many decent  good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated  contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large    preferably large  and unsubtle  and scandalous  kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director   um  no thanks   his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot  the plague is coming  but heres an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope  heres an almost watchable barabra bel geddes  with her bathos turned way down  well  for her   theyre a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and smaller ones  heres an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships crew  heres a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment  these are the small scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life  something hollywood  in its greed  now studiously avoids  these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them  its a personable  human scaled film  not the grotesque  overscaled production that he and others  david lean  will later popularize  whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rouge  i just watched it twice and ill be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes  but it doesnt seem that important to me as a viewer  this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain  and naked city  which you should really get your hands on 
"The premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is charming... but this film is near unwatchable. The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap. Most of the singing is off-key. I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it... The dialogue is really stupid and trite. The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots. I found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering 'when is it ever going to end.'",0,the premise is amazing and the some of the acting  notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp  is charming    but this film is near unwatchable  the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap  most of the singing is off key  i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it    the dialogue is really stupid and trite  the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub plots  i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering when is it ever going to end 
Atlantis was much better than I had anticipated. In some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age. Although this film did demand a soid attention span at times. It was a great film for all ages. I noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. A lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies. After a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching Atlantis.,1,atlantis was much better than i had anticipated  in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age  although this film did demand a soid attention span at times  it was a great film for all ages  i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure  i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies  a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies  after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis 
"I went into this movie with high hopes. Normally, I'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are *always* fun to watch, or so I thought. I'll list the good parts of this movie: -The creature effects. All of the creatures were well-done, their movements were realistic, and they fit into the other imagery well. To be honest, the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. Now, the bad things: -The acting. Good Lord, I've seen bad acting, but this movie takes the cake. Not a single one of the characters is even *close* to believable. It's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try-outs from it. I tried very hard not to giggle too loud, cause I didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre, but the acting really was THAT BAD. -The storyline: The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish. You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film. The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clichéd, not thought-out, and outright dumbest stories I've ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel. -The dialogue: This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichéd thing they possibly can, at every chance they possibly can. In this world, it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movies. It is the world of cheese and cliché. -The special effects. While the creature effects were downright awesome, the special effects fail miserably. Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of it is in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation whatsoever. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest. To sum up: Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money. The concept is good, but it is trapped in the bad directing, acting, dialogue, and cheesiness of the film. Wait til the next big monster movie comes out. It's gotta be better than this, cause Dragon Wars is absolutely horrible.",0,i went into this movie with high hopes  normally  im not too picky about my movies and creature movies are  always  fun to watch  or so i thought  ill list the good parts of this movie   the creature effects  all of the creatures were well done  their movements were realistic  and they fit into the other imagery well  to be honest  the creature effects were the only reason i gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1  now  the bad things   the acting  good lord  ive seen bad acting  but this movie takes the cake  not a single one of the characters is even  close  to believable  its like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try outs from it  i tried very hard not to giggle too loud  cause i didnt wanna upset anyone else in the theatre  but the acting really was that bad   the storyline  the entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish  you can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film  the plot holes  of course  are complimentary with the cheese  this is probably one of the most clichéd  not thought out  and outright dumbest stories ive ever seen put on screen since i had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching parasite on the scifi channel   the dialogue  this is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichéd thing they possibly can  at every chance they possibly can  in this world  it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low budget creature movies  it is the world of cheese and cliché   the special effects  while the creature effects were downright awesome  the special effects fail miserably  yes  they are better than those seen in other movies  but a lot of it is in the presentation  and this movie has no presentation whatsoever  it looks kinda like the special effects used on the power rangers tv show  to be honest  to sum up  dragon wars is worth neither your time nor your money  the concept is good  but it is trapped in the bad directing  acting  dialogue  and cheesiness of the film  wait til the next big monster movie comes out  its gotta be better than this  cause dragon wars is absolutely horrible 
"I first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct Trio Channel a few years ago, and recently watched it again--sans commercials--on Sundance. I was impressed the first time, and found it even more engaging on second viewing. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect--Amos Gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb--but taken collectively, 11 09 01 is a total success. Best of show: Shohei Imamura's amazing final segment, which contemporary critics such as the thick-witted Mick LaSalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on 'the terrorists', but now stands revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic; Samira Makhmalbaf's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of Afghanistan; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's amusing children's crusade for Osama Bin Laden--a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the REAL Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and though Sean Penn's character study seems out of place, it's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film-making. All in all, essential viewing, and a darn sight better than Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center.",1,i first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct trio channel a few years ago  and recently watched it again  sans commercials  on sundance  i was impressed the first time  and found it even more engaging on second viewing  yes  some of the segments are far from perfect  amos gitais hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb  but taken collectively  11 09 01 is a total success  best of show  shohei imamuras amazing final segment  which contemporary critics such as the thick witted mick lasalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on the terrorists  but now stands revealed as a masterful anti war polemic  samira makhmalbafs opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9 11 with a prescient concern for the children of afghanistan  and idrissa ouedraogos amusing childrens crusade for osama bin laden  a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the real osama  youssef chahines segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that bin laden and alqaeda are basically creations of american foreign policy and the cia  and though sean penns character study seems out of place  its still an effectively bittersweet piece of film making  all in all  essential viewing  and a darn sight better than oliver stones reactionary world trade center 
"The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film.<br /><br />Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her.

"My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie. We were very upset that the JCC is bringing this movie to its Jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character Frankie is portrayed. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We demanded out money back. We would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the JCC's Achad program to apologize.<br /><br />We did not like seeing Frankie - a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager - as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nanny's breasts.<br /><br />There was no point to Frankie's character other than to say ""hey, being mentally disabled is funny."" Challenges like Frankie's are a serious matter. Families like mine are truly suffering.<br /><br />The screenwriter needs to explain herself. Does she know families with disabled kids?

"Don't get me wrong, I love action and revenge flicks, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's latest ""The Mechanik"" which is quite good. And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.<br /><br />But with ""Man on Fire"" (and even more then with ""Domino""), Scott shows that rather than using his film-making ""genius"" skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him. ""Man of Fire"" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.<br /><br />The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.<br /><br />At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making PG-13 movies, I find also suspicious that a $70 million movie is made of a B-movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who ISN'T even dead! Go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence...

"- Contains miner spoilers - <br /><br />I have seen a number of decent Indie horror films such as The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category. From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script, god only knows why the writer(s) thought dialogue such as ""No don't go out there; don't go out there she'll get you: if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead"" is of movie quality.<br /><br />This film displays very little character development and to be honest I couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities'. All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls aren't crying their arguing; when they do converse the topics are completely random: about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated (appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer).<br /><br />The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits (although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven).<br /><br />The camera-work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable. I'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie. I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But due to a very shaky camera, grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic. It's one thing to make a film subjective but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of the poor cinematography.<br /><br />I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality. There are no redeeming factors to this film: bad acting, poor scripting, shoddy camera-work and no story. In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief. Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying, arguing, aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations. However, how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car.",0,  contains miner spoilers    i have seen a number of decent indie horror films such as the hamiltons  the boys love mandy lane and cabin fever  unfortunately i felt five across the eyes does not fall into this category  from start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script  god only knows why the writer s  thought dialogue such as  no dont go out there  dont go out there shell get you  if she gets you shell kill you and if she kills you youre dead  is of movie quality  this film displays very little character development and to be honest i couldnt care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities  all they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls arent crying their arguing  when they do converse the topics are completely random  about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated  appropriate subjects when youre being chased by a psychotic killer   the soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits  although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven   the camera work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable  im guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls car almost the entire movie  i think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible  to feel and experience what the girls are going through  but due to a very shaky camera  grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic  its one thing to make a film subjective but its another to have action on the screen that an audience cant decipher because of the poor cinematography  i understand that five across the eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality  there are no redeeming factors to this film  bad acting  poor scripting  shoddy camera work and no story  in light off all this i decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed  wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief  its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying  arguing  aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations  however  how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car 
"with all the European studios involved in this one, you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography; but the local color is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Irritation #1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent in order to play a Spanish cop - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or isn't she a lesbian? - serving no purpose whatsoever. The cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time. There seems to be some message about the mid-'30s Spanish Civil War But since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead, one doesn't see the point in it.<br /><br />Despite the bull-fighting backdrop of part of the narrative (which part? who can tell), you never even get a good look at a bull fight. Earnest Hemingway would have punched the director in the nose - with my blessings.",0,with all the european studios involved in this one  you would think youd at least get some pretty photography  but the local color is kept to a minimum  irritation  1 is mira sorvino using a russian accent in order to play a spanish cop   wtf  the story is hopelessly confused  theres a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused   is she or isnt she a lesbian    serving no purpose whatsoever  the cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time  there seems to be some message about the mid 30s spanish civil war but since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead  one doesnt see the point in it  despite the bull fighting backdrop of part of the narrative  which part  who can tell   you never even get a good look at a bull fight  earnest hemingway would have punched the director in the nose   with my blessings

"Man, this is a hard DVD to come by. I could only find it on Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive.<br /><br />Was it worth it? Well, yes. Not so much because it's a masterpiece of film making, though directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read ""Robert"" but the DVD credits list Curt), or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries -- Elisha Cook, Jr., and Thomas Gomez -- but because my decade-long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied.<br /><br />Essentially, a respected but self-contained engineer (Alan Curtis) has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review. She accepts, a little gloomily. The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.<br /><br />At the show, the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger. The drummer in the band, Cook, leers at the silent lady but gets no response. Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won't give it, and she doesn't want to know his. If she'd been a Longfellow devotee she'd have said something about ships that pass in the night.<br /><br />Okay, Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence. The head police officer, Gomez, turns him over to the DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab driver (""Al Alp""), not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared, it's impossible to dig her up.<br /><br />Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die. But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided her's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story. He joins Curtis's loving secretary, Ella Raines, in re-investigating the case informally.<br /><br />They visit the supposed witnesses again. The ominous bartender is run over by a car, perhaps accidentally, so he's out of the picture. The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression which doesn't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous, orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth gapes, his hammering becomes frenzied. I laughed out loud.<br /><br />Nobody's performance is otherwise outstanding, but all are professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. Best performance, though, is probably by Franchot Tone. He's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi. He's reserved and artistic. Even when he faints he's decorous. I don't know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part. Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture. <br /><br />I don't know why it's considered as classic. It's really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive. A man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it. His use of shadows is quietly effective.<br /><br />Glad I got it.",1,man  this is a hard dvd to come by  i could only find it on region 2  a spanish import  and it was expensive  was it worth it  well  yes  not so much because its a masterpiece of film making  though directed by curt siodmak  the credits on imdb com read  robert  but the dvd credits list curt   or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries    elisha cook  jr   and thomas gomez    but because my decade long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied  essentially  a respected but self contained engineer  alan curtis  has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a new york bar with two show tickets in his pocket  a woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review  she accepts  a little gloomily  the mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave  at the show  the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger  the drummer in the band  cook  leers at the silent lady but gets no response  curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she wont give it  and she doesnt want to know his  if shed been a longfellow devotee shed have said something about ships that pass in the night  okay  curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence  the head police officer  gomez  turns him over to the da  his only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember    not the bartender  not the latina star  not the cab driver   al alp    not the drummer    and since the lady herself has disappeared  its impossible to dig her up  curtis is convicted and sentenced to die  but inspector gomez has thought things over and decided hers probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story  he joins curtiss loving secretary  ella raines  in re investigating the case informally  they visit the supposed witnesses again  the ominous bartender is run over by a car  perhaps accidentally  so hes out of the picture  the hot tempered latina has left because the show closed and shes uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway  elisha cook  jr   is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group  his sweaty face assumes an expression which doesnt suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous  orgasmic insanity  his eyeballs roll to the ceiling  his mouth gapes  his hammering becomes frenzied  i laughed out loud  nobodys performance is otherwise outstanding  but all are professional enough  thomas gomez is always reliable  best performance  though  is probably by franchot tone  hes the real murderer and he fakes his alibi  hes reserved and artistic  even when he faints hes decorous  i dont know how to put this precisely but tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part  alan curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the kelvin scale and belongs in a b picture   i dont know why its considered as classic  its really your basic murder mystery by cornell woolrich  not as good as some of his others  but siodmaks direction is sensitive  a man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it  his use of shadows is quietly effective  glad i got it 
"I am a great fan of the Batman comics and I became disappointed when I could no longer find Batman: The Animated Series on TV anymore. I was excited to learn that there was going to be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode the day it premiered and I was very disappointed.<br /><br />First of all, the animation is very poor. It looks like a cheap, crappy Japanese anime. Then again, just about every modern-day cartoon is like that.<br /><br />The character designs are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, the Penguin is a Kung-Fu master, Mr. Freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head, and the Riddler is a Gothic Marilyn Manson look-alike (which is funny because I don't expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic).<br /><br />The worst character design is that of the Joker. They turned him into a monkey/demented Bob Marley/Kung-Fu fighter! The Joker is supposed to be Batman's deadliest enemy, but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless. In one episode his plan was to put his Joker venom in dog food! Oh, how evil! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents, which is why he fights crime. This version of Batman doesn't seem haunted by his parents' deaths and is not interesting at all. He's also not a detective, just a fighter. If there's an enemy he can't defeat, he won't study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would, he'll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them. A lot of times this show doesn't even feel like a Batman show, just another brainless anime that's nothing but pointless fighting.<br /><br />What I hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains. They've taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In the comics, he's a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. When experimenting on himself, he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature. In this show, he's a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason. Just about all the villains are like that; none of them, with the exception of about one or two, have an actual motive for their crimes.<br /><br />The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode ""Heart of Ice"", which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic, three-dimensional, and likable villain. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin. Even that crappy movie Batman & Robin used it as his origin. In this show, he's a petty jewel thief before becoming Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He's STILL a petty jewel thief! Great origin. No wonder they used it over the one Dini created.<br /><br />As a Batman fan, I don't dislike this show just because it isn't like the comics because I also liked BTAS, the Batman cartoons that came after it, Tim Burton's Batman films, and obviously, the superb Christopher Nolan Batman films. None of them were 100% loyal to the comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it's not exactly like the comics or BTAS, it's that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other Batman media so popular.<br /><br />I've given this show so many chances, but the more I watch, the more I find that disappoints me.

Or watch the real object prompting Moe's exclamation, ""Oh...highly polished mahogany!""<br /><br />Emil Sitka is at his bewildered goofiest. And the goon may look scary, but he's somehow funny.

"After having seen and loved Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll film and I picked out Seed because I happened to stumble on it in a local DVD-store and it's supposed to be one of his better films.<br /><br />While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting. It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. Maybe he should stick to comedy?! The few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times.<br /><br />I hope Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes a good film, because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then. Seed just isn't one of those.",0,after having seen and loved postal  yes  i actually loved postal   i decided to try another uwe boll film and i picked out seed because i happened to stumble on it in a local dvd store and its supposed to be one of his better films  while the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller  it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films ive seen so far  including a massive amount of plot holes  unrealistic emotional responses and sub par acting  it seems like boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it  maybe he should stick to comedy   the few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere  that the special effects are better than i expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere  but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch  which ruined my experience altogether  there are a very fairly well done shocking scenes  but they seem to be there for the shock value alone  and lets not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times  i hope uwe boll will one day learn what makes a good film  because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then  seed just isnt one of those 
"This episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a battle for turf. She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. It's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. But it still is captivating and interesting. Because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we can guess.",1,this episode apparently grew out of the cold war  there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles bronson have come through unscathed  it then becomes a battle for turf  she is attracted to him and vice versa  but the instinct for survival takes over  its a quiet  slow moving  chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust  they come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again  of course  the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive  but it still is captivating and interesting  because she doesnt speak  we dont know here mind very well  but in the end we can guess 
"When I watched this film the first time, it was a taped copy and the title was/is Caged Terror. I still own the tape, and I confess, I've watched it more than once from beginning to end! The film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing! I have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script. The film concerns a couple, (remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man!) who go on a week-end camping trip in what I believe was supposed to be upstate NY. They have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it! The guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them, and he goes; ""And that's beautiful man!"" Heavy man, really heavy! LOL! Anyway, along come a couple of Vietnam vets, one of who plays the flute, I believe. (At any rate they are musical fellows!) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly, they end up terrorizing them during the night. The guy ends up caged in a chicken coop, and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys. Actually, by the end of the night, she seems to be pretty into it, and when morning comes, the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave. Supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! It never fails to amuse me anyway! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I'd actually buy it again, it's classic camp! You gotta love this stuff!",1,when i watched this film the first time  it was a taped copy and the title was is caged terror  i still own the tape  and i confess  ive watched it more than once from beginning to end  the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing  i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and weve had some great laughs from the terrible script  the film concerns a couple   remember this is like early 70s so they are just too hip man   who go on a week end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be upstate ny  they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it  the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them  and he goes   and thats beautiful man   heavy man  really heavy  lol  anyway  along come a couple of vietnam vets  one of who plays the flute  i believe   at any rate they are musical fellows   the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly  they end up terrorizing them during the night  the guy ends up caged in a chicken coop  and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys  actually  by the end of the night  she seems to be pretty into it  and when morning comes  the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave  supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people  and the girl has a smile on her face     anyway  i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh  it never fails to amuse me anyway  if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy  id actually buy it again  its classic camp  you gotta love this stuff 
"""I just viewed this movie last night and I don't think I will ever think the same about any of the actors involved, because this movie will stick in the back of my mind.""<br /><br />The above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of ""A Few Good Men"" which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I will think of ""Tinseltown"" which is a VERY bad thing.<br /><br />I picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought that it at least wouldn't be bad. You could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.), but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. WRONG.<br /><br />This movie is NOT funny or entertaining in any sense of either word. It is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes.<br /><br />The characters are paper-thin. You almost care about NONE of the characters, and since the leads are two struggling Hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them. Okay, the two REAL writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves, so they figure so does the audience. They don't even think about character development, except for trying to tie there story back to ""Gilligan's Island"".<br /><br />The plot is unoriginal. Two guys live in a storage center, where one of them stores a bed, and there are about twenty other people living there, too. The rest of the story is contrived and stupid. Have you seen ""National Lampoon's Favorite Deadly Sins""? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who can't find a good story to make a TV movie about, so he creates one. Now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter, morph Mantegna into to annoying actors half his age, and take away the comedy and you have this movie.<br /><br />The actors try. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie. She is still hot, but it would help if she would actually STAR in a movie instead of constantly making CAMEOS. As for everyone else, I don't think it was the actors fault because they have BAD material<br /><br />Go watch the National Lampoon's movie, but stay away from this movie.",0, i just viewed this movie last night and i dont think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved  because this movie will stick in the back of my mind   the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing  i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie  i think of  a few good men  which is a good thing  now  every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson  i will think of  tinseltown  which is a very bad thing  i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman  i thought that it at least wouldnt be bad  you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling  indiana  where  exactly    but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie  wrong  this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word  it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes  the characters are paper thin  you almost care about none of the characters  and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them  okay  the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves  so they figure so does the audience  they dont even think about character development  except for trying to tie there story back to  gilligans island   the plot is unoriginal  two guys live in a storage center  where one of them stores a bed  and there are about twenty other people living there  too  the rest of the story is contrived and stupid  have you seen  national lampoons favorite deadly sins   the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who cant find a good story to make a tv movie about  so he creates one  now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter  morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age  and take away the comedy and you have this movie  the actors try  kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie  she is still hot  but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos  as for everyone else  i dont think it was the actors fault because they have bad material go watch the national lampoons movie  but stay away from this movie

"German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.<br /><br />Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.<br /><br />The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.<br /><br />The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint ""Precinct 707"" on a cardboard wall.<br /><br />Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.<br /><br />More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride.<br /><br />After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.<br /><br />Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.",0,german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible  hes unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made  lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium  this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew  i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set  the answer is  subterranean  lommel dug a pit and buried it  the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies  only someone who has lived in los angeles  where every auto mechanic  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face  the main character  a villainous beat cop  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent  aside from being a serial killer  he is also the oldest beat cop in la  despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody  then drags them into his home  which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse   and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners  the lapd refuses to investigate  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment  the sets are excruciatingly bad  the production designers budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint  enough to paint  precinct 707  on a cardboard wall  since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals  a sad assortment of european emigres  possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands   bimbos  mimbos  and desperate middle aged women  and since little if any money was spent on sets  special efx  locations or other production value  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms  sadly  they couldnt afford a police car  the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental  more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him  one of these young actors is especially pitiable because hes the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies  the other fits right in  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated  the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her  dont ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered  just accept lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ride  after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance  they look exactly as they did before death  maybe even prettier  with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes  looking nothing like zombies  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway  at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll  and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack  were talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise  stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty  unlike other zombies  lommels girls speak and function as normal    er  i mean  as they did before becoming zombified  this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog  yes  a golden shower it is  i wont spoil anything by revealing the shock ending  all i can say is its perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece  the spirit of ed wood lives on    or should i say his geist

"This movie has the made for TV stink all over it. Though, it started out with great intentions, featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and rushed TV sappy melodramatic acting. The characters were so sappy that at times I thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo, and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another. The Germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch. The only thing that the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for this. I am a huge fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. Nevertheless, this DVD does have an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the WWI front lines, thus making this rental not a total waste of my time.",0,this movie has the made for tv stink all over it  though  it started out with great intentions  featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes  the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue  and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting  the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo  and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another  the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch  the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are  please take my word for this  i am a huge fan of the war genre  and this movie is crap  nevertheless  this dvd does have an excellent extra feature  covering letters from the wwi front lines  thus making this rental not a total waste of my time

"At first glance, this film looks like the Keifer Sutherland series 24 for the big screen. With the focus on a plot to assassinate the President of the United States, a race against time, and plenty of Secret Service agents, the agency under the spotlight in The Sentinel.<br /><br />But wait, the protagonist turns out to be Michael Douglas' character Pete Garrison instead, a veteran Secret Service agent famed for taking the bullet for Reagan in 1981. The SS agents are specially trained to ""take the bullet"", which is what makes them special - who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target? But Garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot, and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot. All this because of his failure in a polygraph test, due to his adulterous banging of the First Lady (Kim Basinger). Tsk.<br /><br />There are shades of Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire. Both featured aging actors, and aging veteran has-been heroes with a bit of a historical reference, who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty. While Eastwood's movie has a more enigmatic villain in John Malkovich, The Sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain, preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex-KGB villains, and the mole within the Presidential Detail. With Douglas on the run from the law, he becomes similar to Dr. Richard Kimble of The Fugitive, hunting the proverbial one-armed man while at the same time, relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents, which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes, it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents.<br /><br />Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, top TV stars of today from 24 and Desperate Housewives, get relegated into support roles as the Secret Service investigators who are looking into Garrison's probable involvement in the assassination plot, and at times seem to have lept off the pages of CSI with their forensics skills. The beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled X-Files' Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, but alas these two had very little to do here. We know the reason why they're in the movie, and that is to get their fans into the theatres. Also, Longoria's role seemed unable to shake off her sexy-mama Gabrielle, and here, has her in fairly low cut blouses (Sutherland actually tells her to cover up) and tight pants (ogle-fest for fellow agents).<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world, and the typical threats that they face daily, including the following up on every nutcase's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world. It's a decent suspense and investigative thriller, with enough subplots to keep you entertained. But one thing though, like most ending action sequences, this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through.",1,at first glance  this film looks like the keifer sutherland series 24 for the big screen  with the focus on a plot to assassinate the president of the united states  a race against time  and plenty of secret service agents  the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel  but wait  the protagonist turns out to be michael douglas character pete garrison instead  a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981  the ss agents are specially trained to  take the bullet   which is what makes them special   who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target  but garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot  and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot  all this because of his failure in a polygraph test  due to his adulterous banging of the first lady  kim basinger   tsk  there are shades of clint eastwoods in the line of fire  both featured aging actors  and aging veteran has been heroes with a bit of a historical reference  who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty  while eastwoods movie has a more enigmatic villain in john malkovich  the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain  preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex kgb villains  and the mole within the presidential detail  with douglas on the run from the law  he becomes similar to dr  richard kimble of the fugitive  hunting the proverbial one armed man while at the same time  relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents  which turned out to be quite interesting to watch   despite slick processes  it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents  keifer sutherland and eva longoria  top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate housewives  get relegated into support roles as the secret service investigators who are looking into garrisons probable involvement in the assassination plot  and at times seem to have lept off the pages of csi with their forensics skills  the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled x files fox mulder and dana scully  but alas these two had very little to do here  we know the reason why theyre in the movie  and that is to get their fans into the theatres  also  longorias role seemed unable to shake off her sexy mama gabrielle  and here  has her in fairly low cut blouses  sutherland actually tells her to cover up  and tight pants  ogle fest for fellow agents   nonetheless  its still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world  and the typical threats that they face daily  including the following up on every nutcases threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world  its a decent suspense and investigative thriller  with enough subplots to keep you entertained  but one thing though  like most ending action sequences  this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through 
"Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they wish!) starring Melinda/Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). He ends up in a South-of-the-border prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw (an overacting Robert Englund in a toupee). She and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they're transformed by a newly fallen meteor. The dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen ""bitches"" and Candy develops a VERY long, talking, killing forked tongue she can't control. Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications.<br /><br />First off, Clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie. You watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises, including an eye-popping, skin tight latex bodysuit...and wonder how come this actress isn't a huge star. It's too bad the rest of this cult attempt doesn't live up to her promise.<br /><br />Blame director/scripter Sciamma, who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughs...but his vulgar gags, annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, lots of garish colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locales.

"I absolutely despise this movie. No wonder Jose Larraz ""disowned"" it at one point and refuses to discuss it. I admire Larraz's work, especially his more obscure slasher/sex maniac thrillers like SAVAGE LUST or SCREAM AND DIE. His work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he can't seem to switch off, owing in part to his secondary career as a painter & cartoonist. It's too bad he never made a Western, his vision would have been perfect.<br /><br />BLACK CANDLES is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece VAMPYRES. And it's notoriety revolves around one scene where a Satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat -- symbolizing The Beast -- as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of Satan. The scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with, relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film's recycled musical score heard in a half-dozen films attributed to Jacinto Molina. The perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail, heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen-aged daughter of the Satanic priest. My but they had fun concocting this movie.<br /><br />The problem with it is that there isn't much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin ROSEMARY'S BABY derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as Satan's bride by a sophisticated coven of Satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister Britain. Led by Eurohorror sensation Helga Line these Satanists are comprised of doctors, lawyers, land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil. All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours, only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword.<br /><br />The film attempts to combine this heady Satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex, and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror Spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by Mr. Molina & Ms. Line, and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one Generalissimo Franco, the dictator who controlled Spain up until 1976. While he lived his decree was that Spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on-screen sex. Spanish directors often made two versions of their films, one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export. As difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden: Spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste. It's not for everyone.<br /><br />But in a bizarre turn of events, without Franco's influence on their culture Spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s, when their Gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves passé when compared to new sensations like JAWS and the STAR WARS phenomenon. And without Franco's constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70s/early 80s, of which BLACK CANDLES is perhaps the best known due to it's emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal. Larraz' major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos (the lesbianism of VAMPYRES, the incest of SCREAM AND DIE & DEVIATION) but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production. Nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the Goat Barn, and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness. The sex isn't graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren't chilling enough to rate as horror.<br /><br />So, BLACK CANDLES is essentially a behavior study -- Here is how high society British Satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the West Midlands or whatever. Between sex scenes the actors/actresses sit around and have lots of discussions. The best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia, with most of it's action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of Ms. Line's character's mansion. Nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft-core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused, and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene. But the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly, pretentious, intelligence insulting, and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze.<br /><br />2/10; Without the Goat Barn this movie just isn't the same, and with the scene it's probably a bit too much for most viewers. Larraz was correct to disown it.",0,i absolutely despise this movie  no wonder jose larraz  disowned  it at one point and refuses to discuss it  i admire larrazs work  especially his more obscure slasher sex maniac thrillers like savage lust or scream and die  his work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he cant seem to switch off  owing in part to his secondary career as a painter   cartoonist  its too bad he never made a western  his vision would have been perfect  black candles is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece vampyres  and its notoriety revolves around one scene where a satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat    symbolizing the beast    as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of satan  the scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with  relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the films recycled musical score heard in a half dozen films attributed to jacinto molina  the perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail  heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen aged daughter of the satanic priest  my but they had fun concocting this movie  the problem with it is that there isnt much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin rosemarys baby derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as satans bride by a sophisticated coven of satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a

"Hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a ""religious picture."" Strange Cargo proves to be no exception. Although utilizing the talents of a superb cast, and produced on a top budget, with suitably moody photography by Robert Planck, the movie fails dismally on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and impossible to accept bathed-in-light Ian Hunter's smug know-it-all as a Christ figure. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few Boston/Detroit/Providence moviegoers, if any, complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a ""message picture."" It flopped everywhere.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on TV. A home atmosphere appears to make the movie's allegory more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Strange Cargo flows along predictable, heavily moralistic lines that will have no-one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny.",0,hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a  religious picture   strange cargo proves to be no exception  although utilizing the talents of a superb cast  and produced on a top budget  with suitably moody photography by robert planck  the movie fails dismally on the credibility score  perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewers involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters  i found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors  parallels and biblical references  and impossible to accept bathed in light ian hunters smug know it all as a christ figure  and the censors in boston  detroit and providence at least agreed with me  the movie was banned  few boston detroit providence moviegoers  if any  complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a  message picture   it flopped everywhere  oddly enough  the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv  a home atmosphere appears to make the movies allegory more receptive to viewers  however  despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film  the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable  heavily moralistic lines that will have no one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny 
"I must say, this movie has given me a dual personality. I've been told again and again to SHUT UP and start speaking like a normal person. But, it's very hard... no not the wang. Did you find that disgusting and disrespectful? Well, get in the mood for a lot more. This movie is just filthy! It's not a film to show your grand-parents, but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace. Anyway, back to the voice mannerisms.

"First, I did like this film. It was well acted by all.<br /><br />However, I don't understand comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few ""gotta-see"" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others.) Still, despite it seeming obvious, I kept watching. It was nice to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.<br /><br />I don't hate it when I guess the ending early in a film. I only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery.<br /><br />Will Smith's screen persona is just likable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. He's energetic and believable in everything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is another fine performance.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is a solid performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes.<br /><br />It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. Excellent.<br /><br />A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot.<br /><br />Overall, I have to recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.",1,first  i did like this film  it was well acted by all  however  i dont understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending  i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few  gotta see  recommendations  but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes   i wont mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others   still  despite it seeming obvious  i kept watching  it was nice to see how everything played out  filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes  i dont hate it when i guess the ending early in a film  i only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery  will smiths screen persona is just likable  even when hes playing such a troubled character  hes energetic and believable in everything that ive seen him do  seven pounds is another fine performance  rosario dawson is a solid performer  portraying a quirky  rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition  beauty is in the eye of the beholder  and with rosario  if you dont find her gorgeous  you should think about replacing your eyes  it was nice to see woody harrelson back on the screen  i havent seen him much lately  but that could just be me  woody didnt have a tremendous amount of screen time  but he sold his jolly  piano playing  blind man character for all it was worth  excellent  a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic  neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic  i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot  overall  i have to recommend this film not for the plotting  but for some very good performances  and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid 
"I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won't be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV.",0,i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago  and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day  its not that bad for a made for tv horror movie  but it is derivative  mostly of the exorcist  and businesslike  for lack of a better word  it wont blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting  but its not a waste of time  either  its the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you arent in the mood to think too hard  however  if you go into the movie looking for some laughs  you wont be disappointed  the early scenes  with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non threatening  and the climactic blue screen effects of a giant black dog  with horns   are pretty side splitting  and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning  not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination  but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv

"When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, go watch this film. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting, and it is very encouraging, in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective.<br /><br />When you know both the Turkish language and either the Danish or the German language, go watch the film in any case. Half of the dialog is Danish in the original, synchronized to German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, subtitled in Danish or German, respectively. When i watched it in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialog, which, deplorably, mostly escaped me, being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles. Still, the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the Turkish.<br /><br />Esthetically, the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness. On first sight, there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning, making it a quick, an agitated film. In particular, even though this is a Kung Fu movie, watch out for the running scenes, beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions. But there are quite a few very slow, emotionally intense scenes, too. And above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age; still, there is some movement in the characters to: Closely watch the villain Omar, whose part and acting i liked very much.<br /><br />The contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity - shown at once, in the same characters, at the same time.",1,when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood  go watch this film  it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting  and it is very encouraging  in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective  when you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language  go watch the film in any case  half of the dialog is danish in the original  synchronized to german in the translated version  the other half turkish  subtitled in danish or german  respectively  when i watched it in mannheim  germany  the reaction of the turkish speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog  which  deplorably  mostly escaped me  being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles  still  the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkish  esthetically  the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness  on first sight  there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning  making it a quick  an agitated film  in particular  even though this is a kung fu movie  watch out for the running scenes  beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions  but there are quite a few very slow  emotionally intense scenes  too  and above all  the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age  still  there is some movement in the characters to  closely watch the villain omar  whose part and acting i liked very much  the contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity   shown at once  in the same characters  at the same time 
"A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice just became more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me. Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.<br /><br />Alice is back and she's carrying a child, she couldn't be happier with her life. But Freddy is also back and he's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But anyways, he wants her child and to be born into the world again. Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too? Well that's what A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out what Freddy's childhood was like and that maybe that's the one thing that can defeat him.<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series. I don't think anyone could be happy with this sequel. Just the story was really silly, I mean it could have possibly worked, but once again, it was just executed the wrong way. I know that if you're looking to see the sequels for the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should watch it, but I really wouldn't recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />3/10",0,a nightmare on elm street  the dream child  the fifth installment in the nightmare on elm street series and the worst sequel ever in the series  even worse than a nightmare on elm street 2  i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street dvd box set for my birthday and i watched all the sequels  the dream child was the worst without a doubt  i was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels  but i guess they just lost the charm  the story was just ridicules and i wasnt happy with where it went  alice just became more annoying  shes not nancy or kirsten  so her carrying this film on her own didnt work for me  freddy is also loosing his scare  this was just getting a bit silly  alice is back and shes carrying a child  she couldnt be happier with her life  but freddy is also back and hes not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie  but anyways  he wants her child and to be born into the world again  did you ever wonder if freddy had parents too  well thats what a nightmare on elm street  the dream child investigates and alice soon finds out what freddys childhood was like and that maybe thats the one thing that can defeat him  a nightmare on elm street  the dream child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series  i dont think anyone could be happy with this sequel  just the story was really silly  i mean it could have possibly worked  but once again  it was just executed the wrong way  i know that if youre looking to see the sequels for the nightmare on elm street series  you should watch it  but i really wouldnt recommend it  its not worth it  at least in my opinion  3 10
"There is so much to love in this darling little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled Mr. Blanding.Melvyn Douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the Blandings' attorney and voice of reason.As well Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grant's. He is the American everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war. The themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity.Yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. It is still relevant today, and I must chalk up the poor reviews I see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies.

"I can clearly see now why Robin Hood flopped quickly. The first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing BBC has aired. The opening scenes were about as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword fight was just laughable. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging some cow clad in make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody. The series may have improved drastically since then, but this first episode quickly put people's hopes down, and is essentially a pile of cr*p.

I have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is sadly an over looked Classic film! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own.

"As a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her put over a song better than she does here. Randolph Scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!<br /><br />",1,as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period  its almost a must see and rates a 9 as a variety show  i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard  captain midnight  webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event  what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day  outside of calamity jane  ive never seen her put over a song better than she does here  randolph scott is memorable as well  even if he doesnt see much screen time  its been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance  with so many familiar faces  its hard to keep track  if it ever turns up on a tv station near you  be sure to catch the doris day sequence  if nothing else 
"I wasn't really going to comment, but then I figured I had something to say. I saw this film two days ago and, although I think it's not a complete waste of time (it might have been of money though, for the producers), it's obvious it has serious problems. It's got really good cinematography and (little but) nice music. A lot has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira but, let's be honest, over what? She is not really an actress an she balances permanently between over-acting and preposterous under-acting. Her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other film: crazy? sad? childlike? an impostor? no one knows, fellows. So she's kinda sorta dictating the rules here.<br /><br />I thought this film was also a good example of the problem most Portuguese films suffer from: soundtrack. There is a permanent NO to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue. People in other countries may think Portugal is the noisiest of places. What thrilled me though, was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it didn't necessarily solve the syndrome. Bad dubbing too, I must say. It's strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene, when the first character speaks is: it's dubbed. And all this to say that the film has technical problems.<br /><br />It also has script problems. It tries to be classical from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows. The writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but... it shows!! All dialog is too expositive and there isn't one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film. It's all a little raw and slightly unpleasant.<br /><br />Not that the film is a total mess, I must stress. I just think the good parts are so obvious that I prefer to concentrate on the bad ones.<br /><br />Direction brings little to the weak screenplay. All shots are classical and un-innovative, but their beautiful. Great work from Rui Poças, by the way.<br /><br />Now, what I think was THE problem, the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously: The guy who plays the guy who DIES is obviously not an actor. Actually, It's a rather important role and I can't see why non-actors are cast for such parts. This guy is neither an actor nor a good-looking man. Which means the whole film rolls down the mountain, since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though he's gone, and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss, when all we see of this character is apathy. Too bad. The world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsessions on people after they's gone. The world is full of great films and also of not that great films. C'est la vie!",0,i wasnt really going to comment  but then i figured i had something to say  i saw this film two days ago and  although i think its not a complete waste of time  it might have been of money though  for the producers   its obvious it has serious problems  its got really good cinematography and  little but  nice music  a lot has been said about ana cristina oliveira but  lets be honest  over what  she is not really an actress an she balances permanently between over acting and preposterous under acting  her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like odete in any other film  crazy  sad  childlike  an impostor  no one knows  fellows  so shes kinda sorta dictating the rules here  i thought this film was also a good example of the problem most portuguese films suffer from  soundtrack  there is a permanent no to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue  people in other countries may think portugal is the noisiest of places  what thrilled me though  was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it didnt necessarily solve the syndrome  bad dubbing too  i must say  its strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene  when the first character speaks is  its dubbed  and all this to say that the film has technical problems  it also has script problems  it tries to be classical from the first to the last scene  there was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows  the writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but    it shows   all dialog is too expositive and there isnt one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film  its all a little raw and slightly unpleasant  not that the film is a total mess  i must stress  i just think the good parts are so obvious that i prefer to concentrate on the bad ones  direction brings little to the weak screenplay  all shots are classical and un innovative  but their beautiful  great work from rui poças  by the way  now  what i think was the problem  the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously  the guy who plays the guy who dies is obviously not an actor  actually  its a rather important role and i cant see why non actors are cast for such parts  this guy is neither an actor nor a good looking man  which means the whole film rolls down the mountain  since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though hes gone  and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss  when all we see of this character is apathy  too bad  the world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers  the world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsessions on people after theys gone  the world is full of great films and also of not that great films  cest la vie 
"I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at IMDb. I worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br /><br />I don't consider this a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a rather well made horror movie. It does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko.<br /><br />The sets are nice (and I don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the Japanese original).<br /><br />The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice.<br /><br />The movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother.<br /><br />Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, because it is very different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Don't go if you only want to see movies that gather Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave it a 7.",1,i wanted to see sarah buffy on the big screen  so i first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at imdb  i worried about seeing a bad movie  well  i had fun watching the movie  some parts  which obviously were meant to be scary  were actually quite humoristic  almost as in buffy the vampire slayer  i dont consider this a bad movie  its not a great movie either  just a rather well made horror movie  it does not rely heavily on special effects  but on camera angles  acting  music  in my opinion  the acting was ok  sarah did a very good job  quite convincing  the other actors were definitely not bad either  i liked yoko  the sets are nice  and i dont care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the japanese original   the scary moments were often predictable  but not always  i have seen quite some horror  and did not expect to be scared now  but it happened at least twice  nice  the movie had some nice scenes that were almost original  like the trails of rubbish  the simple special effects for he ghosts  the eyes of the boy  the cat that made eery noises  the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother  dont go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode  because it is very different from her buffy work  much more serious  dont go if you only want to see movies that gather oscar nominations  its a good horror movie  enough suspense  i gave it a 7 
"I rented the film (I don't think it got a theatrical release here) out expecting the worse. The previews made the film look awful. I was in fact very surprised, it was well worth watching; it was loosely scripted, almost like an ensemble piece of film. It had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing. It is flawed, mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy' effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or Larry Sanders way.<br /><br />At the moment it is the fashion to be critical of Jerry Springer, he is also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it would be proclaimed 'the worst film ever made'. I recommend this film for anybody interested in the show.

"The name Uwe Boll is automatically linked to bad horror/cult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two, three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism. You're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype. You know, like it's popular to hate Uwe Boll whether you liked his movies or not. Let me just assure you that this is NOT the case. Uwe Boll is a terrible writer/director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film-making industry. ""Seed"" is another most unfortunate of proof that. In here, Boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist, like a plot, a narrative structure, character development, tension building ""Seed"" is a hideous movie, full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage. I once read that ""Seed"" was Uwe Boll's interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of Torture Porn flicks, but that's not even close. The film inarguably does borrow some influences from ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"", but basically it's just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence. <br /><br />The first 45 minutes of ""Seed"" are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen. For you see, Boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a (hyper- fast) scrolling text explaining there's a federal US law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail. So you know this will happen later on, but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair. Seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims (exaggerate much?) who wears a bag over his head. He watches real-life animal cruelty footage (and thus WE watch real-life animal cruelty footage; thanks for that Mr. Boll) and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar (including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted). When he's finally captured, during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed, and put on death row, the film even becomes more retarded. After being buried alive because the electric chair couldn't fry him, Max Seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree; this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him. <br /><br />The senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad; they're downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic. Multiple twists and sub plot in ""Seed"" are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they're just too dumb! Nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first. Nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him! ""Seed"" is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes. Personally, I refuse to accept that the cast & crew members didn't notice this as well. It really makes you think that Uwe Boll simply neglects all advice and criticism, and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to. I imagine his yelling stuff like ""shut up and do as you are told"" to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they're shooting doesn't make a lick of sense. <br /><br />Just for the fun of upsetting people, there's a gigantically overlong sequence where Max Seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she's tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room. Instead of shocking, as Boll intended it to be, this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is. ""Seed"" is horrendous, it's disgusting, it's pitiable, it's  Boll.",0,the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror cult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two  three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism  youre actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype  you know  like its popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not  let me just assure you that this is not the case  uwe boll is a terrible writer director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film making industry   seed  is another most unfortunate of proof that  in here  boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist  like a plot  a narrative structure  character development  tension building  seed  is a hideous movie  full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage  i once read that  seed  was uwe bolls interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks  but thats not even close  the film inarguably does borrow some influences from  saw  and  hostel   but basically its just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence   the first 45 minutes of  seed  are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen  for you see  boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a  hyper  fast  scrolling text explaining theres a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail  so you know this will happen later on  but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair  seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims  exaggerate much   who wears a bag over his head  he watches real life animal cruelty footage  and thus we watch real life animal cruelty footage  thanks for that mr  boll  and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar  including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted   when hes finally captured  during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed  and put on death row  the film even becomes more retarded  after being buried alive because the electric chair couldnt fry him  max seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree  this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him   the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad  theyre downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic  multiple twists and sub plot in  seed  are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because theyre just too dumb  nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first  nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him   seed  is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes  personally  i refuse to accept that the cast   crew members didnt notice this as well  it really makes you think that uwe boll simply neglects all advice and criticism  and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to  i imagine his yelling stuff like  shut up and do as you are told  to his actors whenever they remark that the scene theyre shooting doesnt make a lick of sense   just for the fun of upsetting people  theres a gigantically overlong sequence where max seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst shes tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room  instead of shocking  as boll intended it to be  this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is   seed  is horrendous  its disgusting  its pitiable  its  boll

"In 1996's ""101 Dalmatians,"" Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitain Police (God bless them) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians. All covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the ""tin can."" Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from the jail. I say, that's about 28 years - in dog years!!!!!<br /><br />So, in 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed ""102 Dalmatians."" In it, there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think; I should know this since this was just shown on TV recently), and the puppy had no spots!!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) has escaped again, she wanted a bigger, better coat - made once again out of the puppies!!!!!<br /><br />I especially liked the theme song - I'm sure everybody loves the ""Atomic Dog"" song from the 70s or so. And now, we hear a bit of it in this movie!!!!!<br /><br />""102 Dalmatians"" is such a great film that I keep on wondering - WHEN WILL THERE BE A ""103 DALMATIANS?????""

"Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Poor Fish' is a so-so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments. Set in Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black 'n' white Porky cartoon and one of the books-come-to-life Merrie Melodies that were popular at that time. Typically of many of the early Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film. For the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for. Unfortunately, the audience gets far less than they bargained for. As was sometimes the case in the books-come-to-life series, the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non-animated medium. Laughs are scarce and, while the cartoon is just about saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there is very little at all to recommend 'Porky's Poor Fish' over any of the other below-par early Porky cartoons.",0,bob clampetts porkys poor fish is a so so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments  set in porkys fish shoppe  porkys poor fish occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black n white porky cartoon and one of the books come to life merrie melodies that were popular at that time  typically of many of the early porky cartoons  porky is far from the star  appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film  for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for  unfortunately  the audience gets far less than they bargained for  as was sometimes the case in the books come to life series  the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non animated medium  laughs are scarce and  while the cartoon is just about saved by clampetts energetic direction  there is very little at all to recommend porkys poor fish over any of the other below par early porky cartoons 
"I have watched anime but I'm not a die hard fan; and I don't read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background. I have seen ""St. John's Wort,"" and although it isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, it made me pick up ""Shinobi,"" especially since everyone seems to love it.<br /><br />Well, I watched it this afternoon, and fought very hard to keep watching. Yes, it's very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the CGI eye flicker - majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fight scenes, but overall this was dull as dirt.<br /><br />It seemed as if someone took ""Romeo and Juliet"" - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw in some ""X-Men"" for good measure. Two of the characters split Wolverine's powers - the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey-haired guy had his ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such dumb powers? Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death. Man, that's some great power for you. And the other girl, can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the star crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic stare. Wow.<br /><br />I sort of made it to the end of the film, by fast forwarding it, and did see a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people are comparing this to ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero."" Don't make that mistake. They may share similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. ""Shinobi"" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker.<br /><br />I would say avoid this film unless you're 12 to 18 years old.",0,i have watched anime but im not a die hard fan  and i dont read manga  i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background  i have seen  st  johns wort   and although it isnt a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination  it made me pick up  shinobi   especially since everyone seems to love it  well  i watched it this afternoon  and fought very hard to keep watching  yes  its very beautiful   the slow motion water scenes  the autumn leaves on the trees  even the cgi eye flicker   majestic  i liked the hawk  the costumes  even some of the fight scenes  but overall this was dull as dirt  it seemed as if someone took  romeo and juliet    the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers   and threw in some  x men  for good measure  two of the characters split wolverines powers   the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey haired guy had his ability to heal himself  then you have the girl who has a poison kiss   thats poison ivy  from batman   why do they give these women such dumb powers  poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death  man  thats some great power for you  and the other girl  can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands  the other woman  one of the star crossed lovers  has the power of a hypnotic stare  wow  i sort of made it to the end of the film  by fast forwarding it  and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected  some people are comparing this to  house of flying daggers  and  hero   dont make that mistake  they may share similar endings  but thats where the similarities end   shinobi  is made by an amateur   the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker  i would say avoid this film unless youre 12 to 18 years old

"How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is in all honesty one of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. Its not one of those ""gross out"" comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative. Simon Pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish-out-of-water character and is quickly detaching himself from the tripod he once belonged to back in England (the other two would be Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting yourself in the top of the Hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first jab at the lead role was David Schwimmer's comedy Run Fatboy Run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike. His second try is this movie, got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office. I, for one still haven't lost faith in him and I'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory.<br /><br />Other characters were well cast from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst in my opinion fared well in this movie as the love angle to Pegg's character however, the spark that I saw in Interview with the Vampire is still lost. She needs to find it, fast or she might suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of ""rom-coms"" forever.",1,how to lose friends   alienate people is in all honesty one of the best comedies ive seen this year along with pineapple express and step brothers  its not one of those  gross out  comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative  simon pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish out of water character and is quickly detaching himself from the tripod he once belonged to back in england  the other two would be nick frost and edgar wright   getting yourself in the top of the hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with pegg  his first jab at the lead role was david schwimmers comedy run fatboy run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike  his second try is this movie  got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office  i  for one still havent lost faith in him and ill still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory  other characters were well cast from jeff bridges to danny huston and gillian anderson  surprisingly  kirsten dunst in my opinion fared well in this movie as the love angle to peggs character however  the spark that i saw in interview with the vampire is still lost  she needs to find it  fast or she might suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of  rom coms  forever

Marrying an Asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort. This touched on both possibilities along with the third.

"This one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era. Of course, that doesn't mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold.

"This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un-furls around him.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic ""NEW-COMER"" a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed.

Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop machete's, and there's too many machete wielding militia-men too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound, but won't shoot the Militia-men that are killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail in-between his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />It's more of character study, and a come to Jesus moment for one character, than a story about the genocide in ""RAWANDA"". This movie didn't have to take place in RAWANDA, it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time.",0,this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school  watching as the rawandan genocide un furls around him  the movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of rawanda  then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic  new comer  a young teacher who doesnt take life or the situation too seriously  as he and the driver approach a road block he plays around with his drivers i d  not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver cant identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers theyll be killed  and thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him  suddenly realizes that every rawandan  including his driver  is involved and that the europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help  the media cameras cannot stop machetes  and theres too many machete wielding militia men too shoot  the title comes from the armies captain saying hes going to shoot the dogs eating the dead bodies around his compound  but wont shoot the militia men that are killing people around the compound  mainly because they havent fired at the soldiers yet  finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims  flees with his tail in between his legs  rather than face immanent death with the school kids hes promised not to leave behind  its more of character study  and a come to jesus moment for one character  than a story about the genocide in  rawanda   this movie didnt have to take place in rawanda  it could have taken place any one of the genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time 
"This film, like the first one (""The Man From Snowy River"") has the same good and bad features, perhaps even more so than the original. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. <br /><br />The GOOD - Magnificent scenery, better than the first film. I love those high country shots in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a likable guy, as ""Jim Craig."" Bruce Rowland did a nice job with the music, too.<br /><br />The BAD - Once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine ""Jessica"" (Sigrid Thornton) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. In this film, we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father. Previously it was Kirk Douglas, now replaced by the always -profane Brian Dennehy. Speaking of that, it is a disgrace that a Walt Disney film would includes usages of the Lord's name in vain. That was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s.

"This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and dull. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as the Perfect fair and just prosecutor (not to mention executive producer), the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path.<br /><br />Sure, nobody wants to defend the Nazi's point of view, but THAT WAS THE POINT of the Nuremberg Trails! Four hours of simply bashing on the Nazi's.... c'mon! Thats been done already!<br /><br />I really think Alec Baldwin should just stick to being Kim Bassinger's husband.<br /><br />Right after the movie ended, TNT showed the 1959 movie, Trail at Nuremberg.

"This is far more than the charming story of middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing (although it IS that as well). It's the tale of one person learning to love life again, pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more. The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... a few where you'll want to get up and tango ... and many others where you'll just feel good.<br /><br />This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all Japanese movies are ""heavy"" and inaccessible. <br /><br />",1,this is far more than the charming story of middle aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing  although it is that as well   its the tale of one person learning to love life again  pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more  the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact  there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud     a few where youll want to get up and tango     and many others where youll just feel good  this is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are  heavy  and inaccessible 
"Troubled men's magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models. When the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real, Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Writer/director William Byron Hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace, builds a reasonable amount of tension, delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence (one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm-inducing highlight), puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true-to-life characters, further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world, and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity. The fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot: Joanna Pettet as sunny, charming love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien's macho double amputee brother B.J., Seymour Cassel as Adrien's concerned psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien's feisty gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as gutsy homicide detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a hard-nosed police chief, and Misty Rowe as sweet, bubbly model Bambi. R. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. Jack Goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick. Popping up in cool bit parts are Robert Tessier as a gruff bartender, Sally Kirkland as a saucy hooker, Kathy Shower as a fierce female wrestler B.J. grapples with in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of her standard old woman roles. A solid and enjoyable picture.",1,troubled mens magazine photographer adrien wilde  well played with considerable intensity by michael callan  has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models  when the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real  adrien worries that he might be the killer  writer director william byron hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace  builds a reasonable amount of tension  delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence  one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm inducing highlight   puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true to life characters  further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world  and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity  the fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot  joanna pettet as sunny  charming love interest mindy jordache  james stacy as adriens macho double amputee brother b j   seymour cassel as adriens concerned psychiatrist dr  frank curtis  don potter as adriens feisty gay assistant louis  pamela hensley as gutsy homicide detective sergeant fountain  cleavon little as a hard nosed police chief  and misty rowe as sweet  bubbly model bambi  r  michael stringers polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots  jack gogas ominous rattling score likewise does the trick  popping up in cool bit parts are robert tessier as a gruff bartender  sally kirkland as a saucy hooker  kathy shower as a fierce female wrestler b j  grapples with in the ring  and frances bay in one of her standard old woman roles  a solid and enjoyable picture 
"I had initially heard of TEARS OF KALI a while back and it sounded like something I'd be into, but with all the films I have coming in on a regular basis, it kinda fell off my radar. While roaming around the local WonderBook...I spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up. I have to say I'm pretty glad I did. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch.<br /><br />TEARS OF KALI centers around the fictional India-based Taylor-Erikkson cult group, that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's ""inner demons"" - but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough (depending on your viewpoint...) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed upon hapless victims.<br /><br />The film is told ""anthology-style"", with a short but memorable and ""eye-opening"" intro sequence, and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film.<br /><br />The first (SHAKTI) is about a journalist who visits one of the cult-members who is being held at a mental hospital. The journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the Taylor-Erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head...<br /><br />The second part (Devi) concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma. We find that the treating doctor in question is actually a Taylor-Erikkson ""alumni"", and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm...<br /><br />The closing story (KALI) revolves around a quack ""faith-healer"" and his assistant who perform ""miracles"" for a fee. When the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her, the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host...<br /><br />I gotta say I really enjoyed TEARS OF KALI. There are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is. My biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue. The dubbing is sub-par and I would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track. Some reviewers have said the acting is poor, which I don't necessarily agree with. I think that the dubbing is so lack-luster that it makes the performances seem stunted, which isn't really the case. In fact, a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling (the ""doctor"" in the second segment, and the ""client"" in the third readily come to mind...) and notable. The gore FX are very well done for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-via-cuticle-scissors, a pencil-in-the-throat-suicide, some decent (but irritatingly ""shaky"") self-flaying, and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure. Not as rough as some of the more ""extreme"" gore films out there, but definitely stronger than your average horror fare. I also found the story concerning the cult-group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror-story nonsense. There are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the likes of which I haven't come across in a while. Although flawed in some fundamental ways, I still think TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most ""underground"" horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer.

"I'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how ""real"" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's over the top in a big way.<br /><br />The acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through. That's not what I call real.<br /><br />It is so earnest in its desire to be ""relevant"" that it only shows how cut-off from reality Rob Thomas and his staff are.<br /><br />Overall, I found it to be at best a snooze-fest and at worst more than a little annoying.

"This film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons. The co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where Williamson says to Ginty, ""you sure do get around buddy boy!"". I did enjoy this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely. A film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so. It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look. The one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent, so that tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty make for a film worth seeing.",1,this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons  the co ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments  robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end  where williamson says to ginty   you sure do get around buddy boy    i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson  but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad libbed most likely  a film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so  it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film  maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look  the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent  so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing 
"I don't understand your objections to this movie. It is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created in ""Basic Instinct"". The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) Sharon Stone's character is killing all these people because she's crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) David Thewlis' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame Sharon Stone's character; 3) David Morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge. What upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the ""real"" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.)<br /><br />I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of ""2001, A Space Odyssey."" WHO CARES what is real? The blonde really is crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. What's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie.

"I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir, ""Criss Cross."" I found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film. <br /><br />This movie is a ""neo-noir"" since it's modern-day and it's in color, two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status. <br /><br />The biggest negative to it, however, wasn't the cinematography (that was fine) but the muddled storyline. Hey, some of '40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar but I didn't care for some of those either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes. No wonder it was the keep up with this story. It was ridiculous!

"I understand this film to be a debut feature and as such, it is very impressive. It has the feel and pacing of a ""true indie"", yet director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional. The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward. He, and screenwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical ""paint by numbers"" type scripts. It's a story that needs Judd Hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working. Judd is fantastic as usual; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach. Anyway, I found the film refreshing and entertaining.",1,i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such  it is very impressive  it has the feel and pacing of a  true indie   yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision  command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional  the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward  he  and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical  paint by numbers  type scripts  its a story that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working  judd is fantastic as usual  as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd  the real surprise though is elliot korte who plays adam groden  yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach  anyway  i found the film refreshing and entertaining

David Zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again, in a really silly, but many times smart, comedy.<br /><br />The 2 creators of South Park, the main actors in this film, play very good, surprisingly good actually, but this is the first time i see them as actors. The movie oftenly reminded me of South Park - one of my fav shows.<br /><br />It's a really good and funny film, so don't miss it.<br /><br />Vote: 7.5 out of 10.",1,baseketball is indeed a really funny movie  david zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again  in a really silly  but many times smart  comedy  the 2 creators of south park  the main actors in this film  play very good  surprisingly good actually  but this is the first time i see them as actors  the movie oftenly reminded me of south park   one of my fav shows  its a really good and funny film  so dont miss it  vote  7 5 out of 10

"At first, I hadn't read the novel so far and I hadn't hear anything about the author yet. But as I casually saw this movie, I was totally captive by the story. Already as the Jewish watchman primary said, that he knows no one, who have a bad conscience about the war except from Howard W. Campbell Junior, was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war. Terrific! And the fictitious story about ""the most effective spy for the USA in WWII"", who have lost everything, that was important for his life, is wonderful emotional transcribed. This is the best story about the duality of humanity, I've ever heard about! The questions, this movie is introducing, are in my opinion very important for our society: When does someone bear the guilt of something? What is guilt? Who is a hero and who is a felon? What is important in our life? Can you live without paying attention to the political changes? Is the protagonist guilty or not? These questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years. This is a must see for everyone, who have to think about the acception of war! This movie is a must see for everyone, who meditate, what matters in life and what doesn't...",1,at first  i hadnt read the novel so far and i hadnt hear anything about the author yet  but as i casually saw this movie  i was totally captive by the story  already as the jewish watchman primary said  that he knows no one  who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w  campbell junior  was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war  terrific  and the fictitious story about  the most effective spy for the usa in wwii   who have lost everything  that was important for his life  is wonderful emotional transcribed  this is the best story about the duality of humanity  ive ever heard about  the questions  this movie is introducing  are in my opinion very important for our society  when does someone bear the guilt of something  what is guilt  who is a hero and who is a felon  what is important in our life  can you live without paying attention to the political changes  is the protagonist guilty or not  these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years  this is a must see for everyone  who have to think about the acception of war  this movie is a must see for everyone  who meditate  what matters in life and what doesnt   
I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal. His character is like all of us. Wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliver.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.<br /><br />I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry's basically self-centered TV anchorman wanna-be but that's the way it was written.<br /><br />I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened.<br /><br />I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.<br /><br />A funny film.,1,i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasnt the goal  his character is like all of us  wanting more   better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver  morgan freeman made a great god  with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself  i thought jennifer anistons character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carrys basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but thats the way it was written  i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened  i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep  this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart  a funny film 
"First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a huge Justin fan, but I did like this movie.<br /><br />I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about. I didn't find Justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it well done. L L Cool J's character was clearly conflicted, but I honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was kind of just there. HIs character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can do no wrong.<br /><br />Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. Truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.<br /><br />I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't find any of that. Every shooting had a point, it wasn't clichéd, pretty solid really.<br /><br />overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage I've seen on the big screen. I would say it's worth seeing.",1,first off  im not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good  in fact im not even a huge justin fan  but i did like this movie  i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that id never even heard of i had to see what it was about  i didnt find justins acting that bad  it was clearly the worst out of the group  but its a pretty impressive group  with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didnt even make the first credits list  the story is basic  a journalist uncovering corrupt cops  but i found it well done  l l cool js character was clearly conflicted  but i honestly didnt know what he would do in the end  morgan freeman is as always  the wise mentor figure he does so well  and as much as i love kevin spacey  he was kind of just there  his character didnt have a whole lot of substance  but its kevin spacey  he can do no wrong  surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop  truly believable and really in character  he freaked me out a couple of times  i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest  horrible catchphrases  unjustified action sequences  stuff like that  but it was surprisingly well done and i didnt find any of that  every shooting had a point  it wasnt clichéd  pretty solid really  overall  amazing cast  decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump  i dont know why it didnt appear in theatres  it was better than some garbage ive seen on the big screen  i would say its worth seeing 
"<br /><br />Upon concluding my viewing of ""Trance,"" or ""The Eternal,"" or whatever the producers are calling this film, I wondered to myself, ""Out of all of the bad movies I could have seen, couldn't I have at least seen one that was entertaining?"" Even if a film is not well made in terms of acting, directing, writing, or what have you, it can at least be fun, and therefore worthwhile. But not only is this film bad in artistic value, it's incredibly boring. For a plot of such thinness, it moves awfully slowly, with little dramatic tension. At the very least, in a low-brow attempt at entertainment, the deaths of the characters could have been cool and/or gory, but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well.<br /><br />What does this movie have going for it? Pretty much nothing, unless you get entertainment out of watching Christopher Walken, who is capable of being brilliant, put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self-parody mode (WHY did he decide to do this film anyway?).<br /><br />I give this film 3/10, because, God help us, there actually have been worse movies made before.",0,upon concluding my viewing of  trance   or  the eternal   or whatever the producers are calling this film  i wondered to myself   out of all of the bad movies i could have seen  couldnt i have at least seen one that was entertaining   even if a film is not well made in terms of acting  directing  writing  or what have you  it can at least be fun  and therefore worthwhile  but not only is this film bad in artistic value  its incredibly boring  for a plot of such thinness  it moves awfully slowly  with little dramatic tension  at the very least  in a low brow attempt at entertainment  the deaths of the characters could have been cool and or gory  but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well  what does this movie have going for it  pretty much nothing  unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken  who is capable of being brilliant  put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self parody mode  why did he decide to do this film anyway    i give this film 3 10  because  god help us  there actually have been worse movies made before 
"This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. Why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of ""Vault Disney"" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* Most recommended.",1,this documentary was nominated for an oscar and its easy to see why  even 45 years later  it is quite an impressive piece of work  why it isnt in print is a mystery that only disney can explain  good use of live footage and animation in tandem  this used to run as part of  vault disney  every few months or so  but i havent seen it listed in quite a while   sigh  most recommended 
"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep, they're lesbians! Nothing rings true in this ""Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do"" movie. Clunky dialogue like ""I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn't take it"" doesn't help. There's a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliche is left unturned.",0,i laughed all the way through this rotten movie  its so unbelievable  a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage  has a breakdown in front of a real estate office  what happens  the office manager comes outside and offers her a job    hilarious  next thing you know the two women are going at it  yep  theyre lesbians  nothing rings true in this  lifetime for women with nothing better to do  movie  clunky dialogue like  i dont want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didnt take it  doesnt help  theres a wealthy  distant mother who disapproves of her daughters new relationship  a sassy black maid   unbelievable that in the year 2003  a film gets made in which theres a sassy black maid  hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave  the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids  sheesh  no cliche is left unturned 
"I loved this movie, and I am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep -- who cares? These kinds of movies never are. But strangely, there is a message in it. It's that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to be.<br /><br />Parker Posey is great in this movie. I've always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to Katharine Hepburn. So, it's great to see that both Hepburn and Posey made movies about librarians (Hepburn's is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl.<br /><br />I gave this movie an 8. It is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards, although there are some nice shots in it. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.",1,i loved this movie  and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it  or so it seems  no  this movie is not deep    who cares  these kinds of movies never are  but strangely  there is a message in it  its that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to be  parker posey is great in this movie  ive always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to katharine hepburn  so  its great to see that both hepburn and posey made movies about librarians  hepburns is the desk set   all librarians  especially those with a sense of humor  should see party girl  i gave this movie an 8  it is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards  although there are some nice shots in it  but it is incredibly charming and entertaining 
"I remember seeing this one when I was seven or eight. I must have found the characters round, because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie. And the ending, now that's sad, well... for a 7-8 year old kid.<br /><br />I had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately, and found that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional... I guess it's the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child... Pity...<br /><br />I recommend this one for all you parents with small kids...

The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the guest cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. <br /><br />What I don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained. why does it change sex? what's the purpose? and they're aliens? what kind? why were they never shown again in the later mythology?<br /><br />I'm giving this episode a high THREE stars. One of my favorites yet, but the plot holes bother me.

"The Good:<br /><br />Effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top notch set production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Horrible mixture of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Flawed logic. A giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it, no one really even questions it? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was even cast out, nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate Jill?<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />Awful script. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialog was almost laughable at some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Dull characters. Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing to her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. She has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose, any goals (besides the obvious one of Horus), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. There are no stakes - the key to screen writing. Horus will not become immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad guy. One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. That is the problem: devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character, never brings one to fruition. They are cardboard cut-outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces. First time director pacing. Slow, slow, slow. I am still watching the movie as I write this. I cannot pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Not worth a watch.

When the Grinch came out I was excited though I thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was. Though it did have a little Nightmare before Christmas touch to it.

"Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 Euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie. My points;<br /><br />Film is based on 2 things;<br /><br />1) Ethnical point of View: As it happens on most of the American Films, the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture. For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that. Lebanese people are Christian (Ok they got that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries. The main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make ethnocentrism. So we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film. <br /><br />2) Sexual revolution of a girl: There is nothing much to say about this. Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrong.<br /><br />I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning about the movie.",0,unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid 7 euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie  my points  film is based on 2 things  1  ethnical point of view  as it happens on most of the american films  the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the asian culture  but unfortunately it is not enough  knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesnt make a person understand a culture  for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that  lebanese people are christian  ok they got that  and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries  the main difference between eastern and western culture is we dont make ethnocentrism  so we dont judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film   2  sexual revolution of a girl  there is nothing much to say about this  show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong  i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre  please watch dr strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor  a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it  where is the truth  where is the meaning about the movie 
"I went for this movie believing it had good ratings. Firstly, it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright sparks during that scene, I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a Devil. She wears ill-fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids. As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it, ""Go back home and write better!""",0,i went for this movie believing it had good ratings  firstly  it is ridiculous that theyre releasing a movie originally made in 2001  seven years later in 2008 here in india  everything in the movie looks dated  even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget  there is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get  anthony hopkins doesnt seem to know what he is doing in the film  he ends up giving a long monologue towards the end  if the film had bright sparks during that scene  i missed it as i was sleeping on my seat  nothing about jennifer love hewitt resembles a devil  she wears ill fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids  as for alec baldwin a scene where he goes to meet webster for the first time is not to be missed  what a waste of money  as anthony hopkins rightly put it   go back home and write better  
"Lost, probably the best t.v series ever made. the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode, 100 more are raised. if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever. The survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island, a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own. after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting? and heres your answer, every season SO FAR has always been full of surprises, your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time, very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully SO FAR! The series just sucks you in, it's chilling and very addictive, everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story. Lost is simply unbelievable, amazing, highly entertaining, top notch, t.v at it's best.How ever you want to put it. <br /><br />Lost beat's all other show's by a landslide. And if your hating or criticising Lost you don't know how to watch t.v or watch drama. Lost simply doesn't disappoint, you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better. But it does! It just keep's on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off. ""Every thing happens for a reason."" And that is truly shown in the series. Eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up. You will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on. <br /><br />The 10 minutes of excitement: You see something you didn't see coming, something major has happened to character or on the island. There's hope somewhere. You see a major twist that can or will change everything. You hear your thought's churn, you wonder what's gonna happen next. Your heart beating. The 30 minutes of brilliance: You see a flawless scenes, tension building, you hear wonderful music by Michael Giacchino. You see great flash backs, impressive acting. You see wittiness, chilling atmosphere, which then get's converted back into tension.<br /><br />Everyone has there show that they are addicted too, that they can't get enough of, that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode, That they talk about 24/7. Too me and many others it's this series. Lost. Once you start watching, you won't get enough. The creators did a flawless job. Lost is completely unique and original, you won't see anything like it. The clever idea of ""flashbacks and flashforwards"" and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts. Would they ever make a series like ""LOST""? Something so interesting and something you will always remember. It simply has stunned the world when it hit t.v. A new generation of dramatic/sci-fi. A instant classic before it reached out to the viewers.<br /><br />I'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews, and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it, so what's stopping you from watching?<br /><br />Every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better, you get more interested as it goes along, you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off. The characters start to become very likable, and if your the critic type you would love to see Lost in further detail, things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the Island. All together it's a great drama and a flawless series.

"I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before I swear off his work entirely. Having, unfortunately, dealt with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now caught up in so many of Lucas' traits. How else do you explain his rampage of disasters? His only useful film, of course, has been 'Willow'. Everything else, including this, is too reliant on superficial junk.<br /><br />Some spoilers.<br /><br />He can't even have semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard so stuck on his Spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten. <br /><br />Here we have the old adage: ""love conquers all, even disease."" Too bad for Howard that Lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney did better than this.

"I grew up watching this series. I was about seven/eight years old when it was on. I still remember the 1st episode which was called ""The New House."" It scared the h*ll out of me! I can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly. And the ending, oh my God! The hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: Yikes! This was classic TV and it was a one of a kind series. I have found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to any readers: Has anyone purchased this set? Its a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have very good copy. I have a sketchy and poor DVD of ""The New House"" episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids. A great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural. Thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- In fact, I'd love to discuss it.

"This ranks as one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the acting is actually embarrassing. Wasn't Archer once a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but completely implausible. The make up is so bad it's worth mentioning. I mean, who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film. Someone should tell the make up artist, and the DOP that you're not supposed to actually see it. The ending is a massive disappointment - along the lines of ""and then they realized it was all a dream""<br /><br />Don't waste your time or your money. You're better off just staring into space for 2 hours.",0,this ranks as one of the worst movies ive seen in years  besides cuba and angie  the acting is actually embarrassing  wasnt archer once a decent actress  what happened to her  the action is decent but completely implausible  the make up is so bad its worth mentioning  i mean  who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film  someone should tell the make up artist  and the dop that youre not supposed to actually see it  the ending is a massive disappointment   along the lines of  and then they realized it was all a dream  dont waste your time or your money  youre better off just staring into space for 2 hours 
"This is the last of four swashbucklers from France I've scheduled for viewing during this Christmas season: the others (in order of viewing) were the uninspired THE BLACK TULIP (1964; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good), the surprisingly effective LADY Oscar (1979; which had originated as a Japanese manga!) and the splendid CARTOUCHE (1962). Actually, I had watched this one not too long ago on late-night Italian TV and recall not being especially bowled over by it, so that I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it this time around (also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming DVD release from Criterion).<br /><br />Incidentally, FANFAN LA TULIPE has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned CARTOUCHE: not just cast and crew members (producers Georges Dancigers and Alexandre Mnouchkine, cinematographer Christian Matras, actor Noel Roquevert) but plot-wise as well  in fact, the hero is a womanizing soldier (Jean-Paul Belmondo's Cartouche had also had a brief military spell) who's loved by a fiery girl (in this case, gypsy Gina Lollobrigida) while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love (here, it's none other than the king's daughter)! As in the later film, too, Fanfan (an ideally cast Gerard Philipe who, ironically, is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time) is flanked by two fun-loving yet cowardly men (one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father) and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks (the ageing Roquevert, with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl)!; for the record, Lollobrigida will rejoin Philippe in her next film, Rene Clair's delightful romantic fantasy LES BELLES DE NUIT (1952).<br /><br />FANFAN proved to be a big box-office hit on its home-ground and even copped a surprising (but well-deserved) Best Direction award at Cannes over more renowned films like AN American IN Paris (1951), DETECTIVE STORY (1951), OTHELLO, UMBERTO D. and VIVA ZAPATA! In fact, its popularity ensured its re-release in a computer-colored version (presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black-and-white product with a ten-foot pole) and the Criterion DVD itself contains a sample from this variant; being obviously a foreign-language title, there's also the dubious choice of an English-dubbed soundtrack but, even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering, when all is said and done, there's simply no substitute for the original! <br /><br />FANFAN LA TULIPE (a nickname given the hero by a young Genevieve Page as the celebrated Madame De Pompadour) contains about as much comedy as (the expected) action and romance; while some may find this overwhelming, I don't agree myself as I enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and, on the whole, this combination is comparable with Jerzy Skolimowski's equally droll THE ADVENTURES OF GERARD (1970). That said, the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise (particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent) and the film itself rather adult at times (with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout) when viewed back-to-back with vintage Hollywood fare as I did now; the climax, then is quite ingenious: the enemy forces (who, amusingly, are made to speak in speeded-up gibberish!) are depleted by our heroic trio alone, much to the king's amazement who, as portrayed by Marcel Herrand  best-known for his role of leader of the Parisian underworld in Marcel Carne''s CHILDREN OF PARADISE (1945)  is himself something of a lecher.<br /><br />P.S. An Italian TV channel has been threatening to screen Christian-Jaque's promising CHAMPAGNE FOR SAVAGES (1964) for months now but, despite programming it three times already (with a tentative fourth one slated for next week), they have yet to show it; even so, I do have three more films of his in my unwatched VHS pile (equally culled from late-night Italian TV screenings): the three-hour epic LA CHARTREUSE DE PARME (1948; also starring Gerard Philippe), THE SECOND TWIN (1967) and THE LEGEND OF FRENCHIE KING (1971; with Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale).",1,this is the last of four swashbucklers from france ive scheduled for viewing during this christmas season  the others  in order of viewing  were the uninspired the black tulip  1964  from the same director as this one but not nearly as good   the surprisingly effective lady oscar  1979  which had originated as a japanese manga   and the splendid cartouche  1962   actually  i had watched this one not too long ago on late night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it  so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around  also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion   incidentally  fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore mentioned cartouche  not just cast and crew members  producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine  cinematographer christian matras  actor noel roquevert  but plot wise as well  in fact  the hero is a womanizing soldier  jean paul belmondos cartouche had also had a brief military spell  whos loved by a fiery girl  in this case  gypsy gina lollobrigida  while hes himself obsessed by an impossible love  here  its none other than the kings daughter   as in the later film  too  fanfan  an ideally cast gerard philipe who  ironically  is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years time  is flanked by two fun loving yet cowardly men  one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroines own father  and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks  the ageing roquevert  with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl    for the record  lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film  rene clairs delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit  1952   fanfan proved to be a big box office hit on its home ground and even copped a surprising  but well deserved  best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris  1951   detective story  1951   othello  umberto d  and viva zapata  in fact  its popularity ensured its re release in a computer colored version  presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldnt touch a black and white product with a ten foot pole  and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant  being obviously a foreign language title  theres also the dubious choice of an english dubbed soundtrack but  even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering  when all is said and done  theres simply no substitute for the original   fanfan la tulipe  a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour  contains about as much comedy as  the expected  action and romance  while some may find this overwhelming  i dont agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and  on the whole  this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowskis equally droll the adventures of gerard  1970   that said  the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise  particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent  and the film itself rather adult at times  with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout  when viewed back to back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now  the climax  then is quite ingenious  the enemy forces  who  amusingly  are made to speak in speeded up gibberish   are depleted by our heroic trio alone  much to the kings amazement who  as portrayed by marcel herrand  best known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carnes children of paradise  1945   is himself something of a lecher  p s  an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian jaques promising champagne for savages  1964  for months now but  despite programming it three times already  with a tentative fourth one slated for next week   they have yet to show it  even so  i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile  equally culled from late night italian tv screenings   the three hour epic la chartreuse de parme  1948  also starring gerard philippe   the second twin  1967  and the legend of frenchie king  1971  with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale

"This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess, and you'd rather be watching anything, ANYTHING else. At least that's what it was like when I was in elementary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Granted, I haven't seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone: You'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. Trust me, pick anything else. Even though the topic is kind of controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that I can't remember anything about it except that I disliked it so strongly that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you against it.",0,this movie is a bad memory from my childhood  this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you cant go out for recess  and youd rather be watching anything  anything else  at least thats what it was like when i was in elementary school  i just remember hating this movie  granted  i havent seen it in 15 years or so  and they probably dont use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone  youd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them  trust me  pick anything else  even though the topic is kind of controversial  the plot is so tame and slow that i cant remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here  15 years later  i felt the need to warn all of you against it 
A great British Indy movie! Fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set pieces that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he has swapped sides since Quadrophenia!) and Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! Loved the final fight scene with it's nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire on Top of the Pops!...he's not acting....he really is a bona-fide British hippie!!! You don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my Friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection. <br /><br />Give this film a go and you won't be disappointed.,1,a great british indy movie  fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug fuelled set pieces that cheech and chong would be proud of  great to see phil daniels back on the big screen  even if he has swapped sides since quadrophenia   and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies  loved the final fight scene with its nod to zulu and now i know what happened to arthur brown after he set himself on fire on top of the pops    hes not acting    he really is a bona fide british hippie    you dont have to be a biker to enjoy this and its straight into my friday night post pub repeat viewing collection   give this film a go and you wont be disappointed 
"I was very pleased to go and see a ""Milanese"" film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the Milanese philosophy.<br /><br />Film tells the story of a standard -in career- Milanese couple, starting from ""the birth"" to the death. The birth-wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is hard in the ""urbe"" of Milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher, then finally the product: a child, who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because ""the selfish effect"" typical of a nowadays ""metropolis"" personality. The advertising environment with all the ""creative"" under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot. We are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the Senza Pelle's director.<br /><br />The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca nice and well characterised, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known by the ""trash"" TV serie: Le Iene.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10",1,i was very pleased to go and see a  milanese  film shot in milan  alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophy  film tells the story of a standard  in career  milanese couple  starting from  the birth  to the death  the birth wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love  life is hard in the  urbe  of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher  then finally the product  a child  who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because  the selfish effect  typical of a nowadays  metropolis  personality  the advertising environment with all the  creative  under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot  we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelles director  the actors are well chosen  stefania rocca nice and well characterised  and a positive surprise  an unexpected good fabio volo  well known by the  trash  tv serie  le iene  rating  7 10

"So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, it didn't.<br /><br />1) The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the film. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. But it still hasn't.<br /><br />2) The title of the film says the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well it is, sometimes. Like said the film covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice.<br /><br />To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.",0,so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills  natica jackson  or power  passion  murder as it is called in holland  when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality  unfortunately  it didnt  1  the plot of the film is really confusing  there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film  only they have nothing in common  throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me  but it still hasnt  2  the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson  well it is  sometimes  like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest  so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice  to conclude my story  i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs  on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it  by doing this you wont waste 90 minutes of your life  as i did 
"This was obviously the prototype for Mick Dundee but 'The Adventures of Barry McKenzie is funnier. I was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times. Terrific central performance by Barry Crocker in the title role, an Australian who invades England to upset the poms with his free-flowing uncouth ways. Few Brits will be upset by Barry's frequently cruel observations on his hosts. The relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film's final line, delivered by a somewhat reluctant McKenzie as he boards the plane home.

"From everything I'd read about the movie, I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done. Especially the writing!

Sure the CGI effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible.

"Sarafina was a fun movie, and some of the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of 1976. It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience, and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government, who you can not sympathise with. The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually in Soweto, which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. As I said before, you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. Also, it changes some of the details from other accounts. In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students, but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George S, Chris and Finlay",1,sarafina was a fun movie  and some of the songs were really great  sarafina was very entertaining  i dont normally like music things like this  but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box  the movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the soweto rioting of 1976  it showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters  because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience  and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government  who you can not sympathise with  the singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent  the clothing of the students in sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from soweto  they made the movie actually in soweto  which is why it looks very accurate in many parts  all these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied  as viewers we must be critical of the way the history of apartheid was presented  as i said before  you become sympathetic to the students   this makes it potentially less reliable and objective  also  it changes some of the details from other accounts  in sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students  the police and army were very aggressive at soweto  but this is probably an exaggerated event  the police and army did shoot students  but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this  the fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime  this is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students  the movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied  the teacher was arrested for being against the government  and the mum goes to work in a white persons house  but there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws   by george s  chris and finlay
"... so what's in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film? We were three years into the film production code... Barbara Stanwyck had starred in the original play, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for ""Double Indemnity"", with Stanwyck, as well as his hit TV show ""My Three Sons"". Keep an eye out for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and the too-fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who spiced up just about every film put on tape. Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever banter at the beginning. Maggie's buddy Ella is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in ""Holiday"" and ""My Man Godfrey"". In ""Swing High"", Maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army. Maggie misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier. The dashing 20-something Quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) has been playing the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the States. Some good singing by Lamour. Good (but brief) acting performance by Cecil Cunningham as ""Murph"", the wise, helpful owner of the local saloon in Panama. While others have lamented at how bad it is, it wasn't so awful, and is even a little exotic, with the fake Central America locale setting for the first half of the film.",1,    so whats in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film  we were three years into the film production code    barbara stanwyck had starred in the original play  but here  carole lombard plays maggie king  co star fred macmurray is probably best known for  double indemnity   with stanwyck  as well as his hit tv show  my three sons   keep an eye out for a young dorothy lamour  bob hope movies  and the too fabulous franklin pangborn  who spiced up just about every film put on tape  of course  he works in the beauty salon on the ship  add the sublime charles butterworth and anthony quinn  good timing and clever banter at the beginning  maggies buddy ella is played by jean dixon  who was the best friend in  holiday  and  my man godfrey   in  swing high   maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army  maggie misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier  the dashing 20 something quinn has a small scene at the local bar in panama where johnson  macmurray  has been playing the trumpet  maggie  harry  butterworth   and skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the states  some good singing by lamour  good  but brief  acting performance by cecil cunningham as  murph   the wise  helpful owner of the local saloon in panama  while others have lamented at how bad it is  it wasnt so awful  and is even a little exotic  with the fake central america locale setting for the first half of the film 
"<br /><br />Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a ""parody"" of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs. The (very meager) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly. Basically,they spin and growl (yes,they growl) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup. The actors are no-names who never made movies after this,so there would be no point to name them. There's a guy who's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes. He's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. Anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government. if this isn't making much sense to you, you understand. This movie never would have been very good in the first place, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. The movie is horribly cheezy, which although being the whole point,really really hurts what could've been a (reasonably) entertaining movie. At one point, a giant wax tomato ""slides"" on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it! Maybe I would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value, but even this is lacking from this terrible movie. 2/10",0,attack of the killer tomatoes is a  parody  of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs  the  very meager  story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly  basically they spin and growl  yes they growl  and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup  the actors are no names who never made movies after this so there would be no point to name them  theres a guy whos hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes  hes accompanied by a black guy whos master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives  anyway  theres another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government  if this isnt making much sense to you  you understand  this movie never would have been very good in the first place  but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes  the movie is horribly cheezy  which although being the whole point really really hurts what couldve been a  reasonably  entertaining movie  at one point  a giant wax tomato  slides  on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it  maybe i wouldve recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value  but even this is lacking from this terrible movie  2 10
"The movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title.<br /><br />I honestly didn't like the style of the movie. I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose, but what I don't get is why there is so much of it. The movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all. It gives the comic book like experience. However it's visually numbing the viewer, it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs, monotonic scenes, dynamic cut, music and abrupt noises.<br /><br />The movie's storyline is very simple, most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts.<br /><br />I will say openly that this movie didn't meet my expetations a tiny bit.",0,the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike   but are not in any way expect for being smart   one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code  geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title  i honestly didnt like the style of the movie  i believe that anxiety  confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose  but what i dont get is why there is so much of it  the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all  it gives the comic book like experience  however its visually numbing the viewer  it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs  monotonic scenes  dynamic cut  music and abrupt noises  the movies storyline is very simple  most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes  mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts  i will say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit 
"I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this pretty much sums it up. You can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of Chris Columbous.<br /><br />This movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting. I cant even believe these people are considered actors.<br /><br />Painful to sit through and watch. The storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. Horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself! <br /><br />The movie wasn't even set during Christmas like the original.

"With this movie being the only Dirty Harry movie which Clint Eastwood not only stars, but produces and directs as well, you know it's got to be good. Although some say that The Enforcer is the best out of the series, I completely disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series. Although The Enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences, it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do. This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good, and it's got the quotes that make a Dirty Harry film good. In Diry Harry it's ""..Well do ya, punk?""; in Magnum Force ""A man's got to know his limitations"" ; and in this it's ""Go ahead. Make my day."" Also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery, as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old San Fransisco streets in the other films in the series. With great acting by Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good directing by Clint, this is in my opinion the best Dirty Harry sequel ever.",1,with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars  but produces and directs as well  you know its got to be good  although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series  i completely disagree  in my opinion  apart from the original dirty harry  sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series  although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences  it doesnt get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do  this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good  and its got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good  in diry harry its    well do ya  punk    in magnum force  a mans got to know his limitations    and in this its  go ahead  make my day   also in this film its nice to see a change of scenery  as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series  with great acting by clint eastwood and co star sandra locke  and good directing by clint  this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever 
"This movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the man's version of ""Mommy Dearest."" It depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are God. <br /><br />Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say! It is sick humor at best. <br /><br />The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who don't understand mental illness or don't believe what we families actually do live through.",0,this movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness  so many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences  this movie was the mans version of  mommy dearest   it depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through  it also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are god   someone told me it was funny  no way  i say  it is sick humor at best   the movie is so intense and depressing that my son and i had to leave the room  the best use for this movie is for people who dont understand mental illness or dont believe what we families actually do live through 
"Super-slick entertainment with a stellar cast, an outstanding script, and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's. At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens. But whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era. Few films of the late-40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy.<br /><br />Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) works as an ad-man on Madison Ave. where in his little daughter's words-- he sells things to people that they don't need, at prices they can't afford. He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban ""cave"". So, with wife Myrnah Loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside. Needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion.<br /><br />There's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script. I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have. Of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land. The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time. Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant, so it's just one well-placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own. Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high-point. Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point. That's a real movie triumph for any era.<br /><br />Reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind. With their live-in maid, the Blandings may not be a typical American family, but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical. And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an ""ad-man"" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ""ham"". More than anything, however, there's the movie's sunny optimism. Oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through. Indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day. It's that easily over-looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period.<br /><br />So, if you haven't seen it, catch it next time around.",1,super slick entertainment with a stellar cast  an outstanding script  and a firm grip on the approaching 1950s  at the time  rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens  but whatever the value of those shadowy downers  they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era  few films of the late 40s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy  jim blandings  cary grant  works as an ad man on madison ave  where in his little daughters words   he sells things to people that they dont need  at prices they cant afford  hes making good money  but like thousands of others  hes tired of living in a cramped urban  cave   so  with wife myrnah loy  they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside  needless to say  in the arms of nature  they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion  theres hardly a lifeless line in the entire script  i dont know if writers panama and frank got an oscar  but they should have  of course  the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land  the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage  with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time  of course  no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant  so its just one well placed laugh after another  particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own  yet  oddly  the film appears to have no comedic high point  instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they dont peak at any particular point  thats a real movie triumph for any era  reaching back 60 years later  we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind  with their live in maid  the blandings may not be a typical american family  but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical  and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an  ad man  tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more  ham   more than anything  however  theres the movies sunny optimism  oh sure  the feeling falters at times  yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through  indeed  life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge  so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day  its that easily over looked subtext  along with the sheer entertainment value  that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period  so  if you havent seen it  catch it next time around 
"This film was very well advertised. I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months. While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it. Then I went and saw it, I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie! I always go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to go into them with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. Now it wasnt the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it, but for true comedy fans Id say pass. Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead!!!",0,this film was very well advertised  i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months  while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be  my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it  then i went and saw it  i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie  i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in  plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie  i always go into a movie with an open mind  not trying to go into them with too many expectations  but this movie was not that funny  now it wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen  but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo  if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it  but for true comedy fans id say pass  maybe even check out the kings of comedy again  something told me to go see meet the parents instead   
"This film came recommended as a good action film, which I don't really think it is. I found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow. There really isn't that much action until the end of the film and it's pretty dark and hard to see what's really happening. I was sure hoping for something different, but, alas, didn't find it here.",0,this film came recommended as a good action film  which i dont really think it is  i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow  there really isnt that much action until the end of the film and its pretty dark and hard to see whats really happening  i was sure hoping for something different  but  alas  didnt find it here

"<br /><br />If you're at all interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans/early 19th century American history, or Yul Brynner, see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it. Don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews. My reaction to it was that it is entertaining, well acted (for the most part), has some very witty dialogue, and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer Jean Lafitte. While not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role Lafitte played in New Orleans' history, and the love-hate relationship between the ""respectable"" citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Don't worry about what the film doesn't do, but watch it for what it does do, i.e., for its study of one of New Orleans', and America's, most intriguing historical figures.",1,if youre at all interested in pirates  pirate movies  new orleans early 19th century american history  or yul brynner  see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it  dont be put off by various lacklustre reviews  my reaction to it was that it is entertaining  well acted  for the most part   has some very witty dialogue  and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm  appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte  while not all the events in the film are historically accurate  can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this    i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans history  and the love hate relationship between the  respectable  citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the citys favorite sons  dont worry about what the film doesnt do  but watch it for what it does do  i e   for its study of one of new orleans  and americas  most intriguing historical figures 
"Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. The performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. However, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. The location shooting in New York City, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior ""The Naked City"", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. Otherwise, it's not much to write home about. It is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets.<br /><br />.",0,very low budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park  and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm  although released by rko  this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution  the cast and crew  with a few exceptions  among them a young and uncredited jack lord  director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner  are comprised of complete unknowns  and it shows  the performances are universally sub par and wouldnt pass muster in a high school training film  the direction is stodgy and choppy and  as mentioned previously  theres no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors  however  despite the films many shortcomings  it does have a few good points  the location shooting in new york city  and the films ultra low budget  gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior  the naked city   a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled  and some of the investigating procedures are clever  otherwise  its not much to write home about  it is worth a look  however  for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early 1950s  and old car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of 30s and 40s cars in the streets   
I thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first. It wouldn't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money. The movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I wasn't expecting Justin Timberlake to do that good a job. Considering it is his first movie he did a good job. This is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night. It should go pretty well. The cast was great. So I highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out!,1,i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first  it wouldnt have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money  the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world  justin timberlake did a good job  i wasnt expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job  considering it is his first movie he did a good job  this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just dont know what you want to rent that night  it should go pretty well  the cast was great  so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out 
"""Convicts"" is very much a third act sort of film. All the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind-down of a late southern day. And, by extension, the life of its main character, Soll (Robert Duvall).<br /><br />This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, the worked together on ""The Trip to Bountiful"", a film that seems almost action-packed in comparison to this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he's just barely this side of adequate. The slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita, who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light & warmth.<br /><br />Because this is essentially a filmed play, with little in the way of editing or directing prowess, it all comes to the acting. As far as I'm concerned there's no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are wholly real, uninterested in anything besides living. Lukas Haas, a young actor who I was familiar with from ""Testament"" and ""Witness"", plays a character very much like his other early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, slightly scared and sad, somehow. These are qualities that seem natural from him.<br /><br />Perhaps a title like ""Convicts"" is a disservice to this film. That title, along with the opening scene, seem to create an image of a far more high-strung western type picture. If slow-paced stage productions don't interest you terribly, you'll want to pass on this one as well. Otherwise, this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often.<br /><br />Enjoy.",1, convicts  is very much a third act sort of film  all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind down of a late southern day  and  by extension  the life of its main character  soll  robert duvall   this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote  six years earlier  the worked together on  the trip to bountiful   a film that seems almost action packed in comparison to this one  masterson is not necessarily a good director  in fact  hes just barely this side of adequate  the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita  who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light   warmth  because this is essentially a filmed play  with little in the way of editing or directing prowess  it all comes to the acting  as far as im concerned theres no flaws here  robert duvall and james earl jones  two of the best american actors  both born in january 1931   create characters that are wholly real  uninterested in anything besides living  lukas haas  a young actor who i was familiar with from  testament  and  witness   plays a character very much like his other early roles  he is quiet  withdrawn  slightly scared and sad  somehow  these are qualities that seem natural from him  perhaps a title like  convicts  is a disservice to this film  that title  along with the opening scene  seem to create an image of a far more high strung western type picture  if slow paced stage productions dont interest you terribly  youll want to pass on this one as well  otherwise  this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often  enjoy 
"This show is awesome. I thought that the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But the other shows were awesome; Kerry was my favorite character, because she was in ""the dark side."" I also thought that Bridget was funny because she was all perky. I also thought that guy who played Kyle was really, really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. This whole entire TV show is funny, and I wish they still showed it on TV. when they did show it on TV, though, I watched it every single time it was on.

If your a hard core Freddy fan then you might not like it. This seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason it holds it self up is the back story on Freddy.<br /><br />The one thing that is always great in Nightmare movies are the death scenes. But the death scenes were very crappy in this. The visual effects were great and the acting was OK but the back story was excellent. Basically Freddy's story comes full circle in this.<br /><br />I have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws: <br /><br />1. A Nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /><br />2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /><br />3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /><br />4. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /><br />5. A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /><br />6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /><br />I recommend it if you enjoy the series. This is were Freddy is fully explained but thats all there is. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare.<br /><br />(7/10),1,if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it  this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series  not much to see here  the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddy  the one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes  but the death scenes were very crappy in this  the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent  basically freddys story comes full circle in this  i have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws   1  a nightmare on elm street   8 10   2  freddys dead  the final nightmare   7 10   3  a nightmare on elm street 4  the dream master   7 10   4  a nightmare on elm street 3  the dream warriors   7 10   5  a nightmare on elm street 5  the dream child   6 10   6  a nightmare on elm street 2  freddys revenge   3 10   i recommend it if you enjoy the series  this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is  next on my list wes cravens new nightmare   7 10 
"I didn't have HUGE expectations for this film when renting it for $1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise with its ""killer cut"" of ""more gore! more sex!"" Can't go wrong there! Well... needless to say, the box is a fraud. How in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low?<br /><br />It all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her. Then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. They slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they ""cut"" her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon.<br /><br />From there, repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased/killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes. Add in one tit shot. That is Soul Survivors.<br /><br />I wouldn't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick. If I rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex.... I want more violence and sex! One full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it. If this is the Killer Cut, what is the Theatrical Cut?! Of course, I doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place. Shame on the actors in this film. I could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before, but they were all established before this was released. I don't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi-big names or not.

"I've long wanted to see this film, being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but the talent of McCallum shines through this juvie role. Thank heavens for Turner Classic which aired the show last week. I can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war, especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s. Some of the boys are a bit scary. I certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well-lit street, much less a dark one. There were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well, or as they call him, a firefly.",1,ive long wanted to see this film  being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum  i agree that the romantic sub plot was a waste of time  but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role  thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week  i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war  especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s  some of the boys are a bit scary  i certainly wouldnt want to met them on a well lit street  much less a dark one  there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well  or as they call him  a firefly 
"I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new ""Dukes"" movie is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider modernized then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)""You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is."" Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I won't get over it, it was a DISGRACE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing right in the movie title was ""HAZZARD."" Was all the profanity, smoking, and drinking really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head. She is in NO way a Daisy Duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script.

"This movie was made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I am not one of them. I think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon (still, I'm generally not a fan of black metal). But as I was carrying this DVD case to pay for it, I convinced myself, that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing. Thus I assumed I'm in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background. Now, that is what I do like.<br /><br />I got home and popped it in. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AWFUL camera work and DISGUSTING quality. And that was then (2002), that it looked like it was shot using a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a nice setting for this... picture. <br /><br />After a couple of months I got back to it (in mentioned surroundings) and saw half. Then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me. My disliking evolved. I noticed how funny Dani (1,65m; 5'5"" height) looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart. (Yes, ripping. His head apparently had no skull.) I also found that this movie may have no sense. Still, I haven't finished it yet, so I wasn't positive.<br /><br />After a couple more tries I finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back... (Yes, it took me 5,5 years.) So - Dani in fact was funny as Satan/Manson/super-evil-man's HELPER and the movie DID NOT make sense. See our bad person employs Dani to do bad things. He delivers. Why? Well I guess he's just very, very bad. As a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it.<br /><br />We have a couple of short stories joined by Dani's character. My favourite was about a guy, who STEALS SOMEONE'S LEG, because he wants to use it as his own. Yeah, exactly. <br /><br />The acting's ROCK BOTTOM. The CGI is the worst ever. I mean Stinger beats it (and, boy, is Stinger's CGI baaaaad). The story has no sense. And the quality is... Let's just say it is not satisfying. The only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore. Blood and guts are made pretty well. Why, you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it... and then eats what fell out. Why? We never know. We do know, however, that this cat must have been on illegal substances, as his heart is almost half his size.)<br /><br />You might think, after my comment that this movie is so bad it's good, but it's just bad.

"After reading the other reviews for this film I am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film I saw was absolutely dire, with wooden acting, lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing, one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies, sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie, all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on DVD is best to avoid.",0,after reading the other reviews for this film i am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film i saw was absolutely dire  with wooden acting  lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing  one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies  sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie  all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on dvd is best to avoid 
"When a movie shocks you with it's disturbing, brooding atmosphere, and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography, you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat, masterpiece of a film. Although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time. I say, proudly, that I am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. Movies like Breakdown and The Missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think ""holy crap, that could happen to me"", and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. Because I am only 21, I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds, Jon Voight and Ned Beatty, albeit I am familiar with them, I didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long. I must say, after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time, I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. Burt Renyolds plays Lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water. Renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo. Witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers, Drew and Bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight, once again I have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike Renyolds, I have quite liked Voight's acting (and i don't regard Anaconda when I say that), for example the national treasure movies. Voight plays Ed, whom, like Lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis' machismo. The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous ""Duelling Banjo's"" at the start of the film with Ronny Cox's character Drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. As with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. The film's cinematics do not let up, and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film. In wrapping up, Deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history.",1,when a movie shocks you with its disturbing  brooding atmosphere  and grabs you by the throat with its stunning cinematography  you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat  masterpiece of a film  although with most modern movies  extremely enjoyable as some are  those that really shock you into focus are the strongest  and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly  stick with you for a life time  i say  proudly  that i am a fan of movies that disturb  not just horror movies  but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding  movies like breakdown and the missing  that send a chill down your spine  making you think  holy crap  that could happen to me   and visually entice you  are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie  because i am only 21  i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds  jon voight and ned beatty  albeit i am familiar with them  i didnt watch them grow and proceed as actors  as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long  i must say  after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time  i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago  and still lives its terror up in competition to modern movies  burt renyolds plays lewis  the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made  filling the whole wilderness in water  renyolds character is an experienced adventurer  sort of no nonsense  and filled with machismo  witnessing him portray the tough guy  made me think differently about him as an actor  as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician  the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader  ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers  drew and bob respectively  joining in for the fun of a canoe trip  the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight  once again i have only seen him as an older actor  however  unlike renyolds  i have quite liked voights acting  and i dont regard anaconda when i say that   for example the national treasure movies  voight plays ed  whom  like lewis  is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character  a reluctant hero  leader and definitely lacks lewis machismo  the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside  you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to  like the imbred kid who plays the infamous  duelling banjos  at the start of the film with ronny coxs character drew  and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene  as with all atmospheric movies  from this moment on  dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form  the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and natures odds for survival  the films cinematics do not let up  and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow  as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him  cocks his rifle  only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck  was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film  in wrapping up  deliverance is one film  whos dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date  remains one of the best films in cinematic history 
"As with most of Eleanor Powell's films, this one plays out along the flimsiest of plots. For some reason -- oh it is explained! -- she's selected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing. But, as always, Powell's dancing is superb and worth the price of admission. And in this one Lahr plays his cowardly lion, evoking warm memories of that Technicolor film of 1939. A fringe benefit is hearing a young Frank, with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise-guy persona later on. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity. Watch particularly for his unique duet with Dorsey's trumpet man, Ziggy Elman. I say ""unique"" perhaps in ignorance, but I know of no other drum/trumpet sequence like this one on film or records. This film is fun. Even Skelton's goofy persona is relatively restrained.

"What surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted. Similar films such as Anita and Me have never caused as much hype as this film has, though I think that's probably because of the mention of 'Beckham' in the title more than anything else.<br /><br />It's a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message - you can do anything if you're determined enough, and put your mind to it, which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film.<br /><br />I think this is one of Keira Knightley's better films, and I think she's a brilliant actress, and was excellent for the role. Parminder Nagra was brilliant too.

"I loved the way EARTH is made. Its photography is unbelievable, editing it must have been an interesting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice over is PERFECT. In addition its music and sound editing make watching EARTH a profound experience you don't want to miss. You really are on a journey to where you would probably never-ever end up by yourself. <br /><br />And although, at first, I was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival, I could not help laughing myself sometimes. Nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend.<br /><br />But, rather than the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a profound question:""Howcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?""<br /><br />With this question in mind, you'll understand how I felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing EARTH. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once (all that not being a NGO activist at all!)...<br /><br />So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our -still- fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate... (www.loveearth.com)<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there. Yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through.<br /><br />I hope that cutting on my energy-use will do.

"I didn't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out. Still, I held out hope. It sounded a bit much like ""Bride and Prejudice"" (L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B&P was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters.<br /><br />""My Bollywood Bride"" had none of that. The acting seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers. Characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue. I mean a lot. I know sometimes it's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting.<br /><br />Two stars is being somewhat generous.",0,i didnt expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend  it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out  still  i held out hope  it sounded a bit much like  bride and prejudice   l a  guy falls for an indian beauty  parental conflict  blah blah blah   b p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters   my bollywood bride  had none of that  the acting seemed stilted and way to by the numbers  characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student  technically  the sound really bothered me  it seemed as if there was a lot of over dubbing of dialogue  i mean a lot  i know sometimes its necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting  two stars is being somewhat generous 
"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has very good acting by Hanks, Newman, and everyone else. Definitely Jude Law's best performance. The cinematography is excellent, the editing is about as good, and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special. To me, it takes a lot to beat Godfather, but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest. Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book.",1,this is one of the best movies ive ever seen  it has very good acting by hanks  newman  and everyone else  definitely jude laws best performance  the cinematography is excellent  the editing is about as good  and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie  the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special  to me  it takes a lot to beat godfather  but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest  definitely a best picture nominee in my book 
"Growing up in NYC in the late 80's/early 90's club-scene, I can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period. No Madonna did not come up with the idea of Voguing but this is where she got it from! Instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights, voguing allowed people to ""fight"" within the confines of everything short of touching each other (which would warrant an automatic disqualification). Seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented/well orchestrated ""throw-downs"" in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here...Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée,Xtragavaganza, etc...all commemorated in the likes of such period-pieces as Malcom McLaren's song ""Deep in Vogue""...it didn't matter who you were, or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this ""magic kingdom"" of sorts, you became part of something bigger than yourself/you were important/and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination...and anybody from anywhere could become King (or Queen) as the case may have been. The words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor. All of the tension, excitement, and magic of that very urban NYC energy is captured in this film. BRILLIANT!!! PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD for the world to see!!!

"VIVAH in my opinion is the best movie of 2006, coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career. I am not too keen in romantic movies these days, because i see them as ""old wine in a new bottle"" and so predictable. However, i have watched this movie three times now...and believe me it's an awesome movie.<br /><br />VIVAH goes back to the traditional route, displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In that sense Sooraj R. Barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />Several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately: <br /><br />* When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene.<br /><br />* The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to see her - i.e. a shy Shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation. Also Amrita's naive nature, limited eye-contact, shy characteristics and answering softly to Shahid's questions.<br /><br />* The emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she feeds him at Shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece.<br /><br />Clearly the movie belongs to Amrita Rao all the way. The actress portrays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the whole movie, and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly.<br /><br />Shahid Kapoor performs brilliantly too. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya film. In fact Shahid and Amrita make a cute on-screen couple, without a shadow of doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good).<br /><br />On the whole, VIVAH delivers what it promised, a well made and realistic story of two families. The movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. It's a must see!",1,vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006  coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career  i am not too keen in romantic movies these days  because i see them as  old wine in a new bottle  and so predictable  however  i have watched this movie three times now   and believe me its an awesome movie  vivah goes back to the traditional route  displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage  the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do  or would do  when it comes to marriage  in that sense sooraj r  barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well made highly entertaining movie  several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately     when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride  amrita rao    the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family  the song do anjaane ajnabi goes well with the mood of this scene    the first conversation between shahid and amrita  when he comes to see her   i e  a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation  also amritas naive nature  limited eye contact  shy characteristics and answering softly to shahids questions    the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle  alok nath  when she feeds him at shahids party in the form of anothers daughter in law rather than her uncles beloved niece  clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way  the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her  she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie  and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly  shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too  he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r  barjatya film  in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on screen couple  without a shadow of doubt  other characters   alok nath  excellent   anupam kher  brilliant   mohan joshi  very good   on the whole  vivah delivers what it promised  a well made and realistic story of two families  the movie has top notch performances  excellent story and great music to suit the film  as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r  barjatya  its a must see 
"There is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. And there is also emotion in the inner-workings of Mathieu's family dealing w/ his mother's problems--and how that comes to bear on their relationship. But the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless I'm just too dumb to pick up on them). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the boys' break-up? And the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first. It seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills, or some male nudity.

"For a low budget movie this was really good. I put this well above your average action B-movie. Sean and Corinne delivered in this movie, and they didn't seem camera shy. Watch out for the cameos of Jeanne and Jared. I didn't think that the producers would even consider that, but the runner-ups deserve that much. <br /><br />I'll be looking forward to more of Sean and Corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very genuine, and sexy Corinne's character was pretty hard-nosed and on point. She connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence. It was a great idea to cast Billy Zane as the smart and witty villain. His charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. The action sequences weren't cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie. Of course there were flaws, but that comes with the territory. <br /><br />Overall, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for TV. Sean and Corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared, and the rest of the Next Action Star cast get their chance to also join their co-stars in entertainment success.<br /><br />Final Judgment: ***/****",1,for a low budget movie this was really good  i put this well above your average action b movie  sean and corinne delivered in this movie  and they didnt seem camera shy  watch out for the cameos of jeanne and jared  i didnt think that the producers would even consider that  but the runner ups deserve that much   ill be looking forward to more of sean and corinnes involvement in the movie entertainment industry  seans character seemed very genuine  and sexy corinnes character was pretty hard nosed and on point  she connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence  it was a great idea to cast billy zane as the smart and witty villain  his charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch  the chemistry between zane and seans character was pretty good  the action sequences werent cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie  of course there were flaws  but that comes with the territory   overall  this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for tv  sean and corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game  i hope that jeanne  jared  and the rest of the next action star cast get their chance to also join their co stars in entertainment success  final judgment          
"This movie is horrible, but you have to see it because of that. I'm not here to discuss the entire film, just the greatest chase scene ever. When Eddie dumbs milk on Tim, he gets chased down the hallway. Eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player; buy the DVD and watch it slow). The best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door. But when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics (mainly friction); yet what lies behind the door is supreme. The steepest stair case in any school ever, which this jock proceeds to CLEAR in the air. In reality he probably would die of a broken neck. Not only does he defy all concepts of reality, he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation. Go and buy this one. Trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks.",1,this movie is horrible  but you have to see it because of that  im not here to discuss the entire film  just the greatest chase scene ever  when eddie dumbs milk on tim  he gets chased down the hallway  eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences  like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player  buy the dvd and watch it slow   the best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door  but when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics  mainly friction   yet what lies behind the door is supreme  the steepest stair case in any school ever  which this jock proceeds to clear in the air  in reality he probably would die of a broken neck  not only does he defy all concepts of reality  he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation  go and buy this one  trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks 
"One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it's always been a favorite since then. The musical numbers are all memorable. In the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent (unlike a CERTAIN Academy Award nominated current musical based in a large midwestern city). All of the main roles were beautifully cast...Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a menacing Bill Sikes (who thankfully has no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as the Dodger were great too. Mark Lester comes across as an innocent waif, which was what Dickens intended when he wrote the book! Then, of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in ""consider yourself,"" ""I'd Do Anything"" ""Who Will Buy"" and ""be Back Soon,"" many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.",1,one of the last great musicals of the 60s  i was 7 years old the first time i saw this movie  and its always been a favorite since then  the musical numbers are all memorable  in the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent  unlike a certain academy award nominated current musical based in a large midwestern city   all of the main roles were beautifully cast   ron moody shines as fagin  as does shani wallis as nancy  oliver reed was a menacing bill sikes  who thankfully has no musical numbers  lol   and mark lester as oliver and jack wild as the dodger were great too  mark lester comes across as an innocent waif  which was what dickens intended when he wrote the book  then  of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in  consider yourself    id do anything   who will buy  and  be back soon   many who were children  this is a great show for the whole family 
"Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. I mean, when you really do study this story, you could go into so many philosophies on why Othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later on for my report I also watched this version of Othello and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness.<br /><br />Othello is the big time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello snuck off with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who has stood by Othello. Due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he just mearly hints at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio, never says that they are, just makes Othello think that it's happening. Othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him out.<br /><br />Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend that you read it. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. Othello the movie is also great and once again I recommend it, it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel, or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him. This is a terrific movie, great acting, good sets, and good direction, this is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story.<br /><br />10/10",1,othello  the classic shakespearen story of love  betrayal  lies  and tragedy  i remember studying this story in high school  actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was  the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship  love  and racism perfectly  i mean  when you really do study this story  you could go into so many philosophies on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye  but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant  lawerance and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood its darkness  othello is the big time soldier in his city  he is loved by everyone  including the king  but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter  desdemona  the king is infuriated  but excepts it  othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend  cassio  his side man instead of iago  who has stood by othello  due to his insane jealousy  hes out for revenge  still pretending to be othellos best friend  he just mearly hints at othello that desdemona is cheating on him with cassio  never says that they are  just makes othello think that its happening  othello is driven insane and doesnt have pleasant plans for desdemona or cassio and iago is more than happy to help him out  othello is an incredible story  i highly recommend that you read it  its an incredible story that keeps you thinking after youve read it  othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it  it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel  or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and desdemona  how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him  this is a terrific movie  great acting  good sets  and good direction  this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story  10 10
"This started out to be a movie about the street culture of the Bronx in New York. What it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life, for American youth. What other movie has done this except Rebel Without A Cause? One of the most important movies of all time. The elements are simple yet fascinating. The story is timeless, young people try to succeed against all odds. Yet the story is always believable and never depressing.

"My commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. In fact, they're quite congruent with mine. What gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie, it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to Young song to the heroine, who is unaware of what's taken place. Somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the West Coast in search of?????

"Because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers. Where do you even begin? In a spout of b*tchiness, I'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie. Scratch that. Nearly does not belong in that sentence. I can't think of even one character who was portrayed well. Although, in all fairness, it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I purposefully don't include - I'm pretending she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was God awful. It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways. Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I will admit (grudgingly) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise. And the ending was at least slightly humorous. But this film is up there with the worst I've seen. Don't watch it. Just don't. There is absolutely no value in watching it. None.

"The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a ""Swedish"" film - the first being Susan Sontag's ""Brother Carl"" (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens' ""The Old Curiosity Shop"": ""One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell."" Pretty much the same thing here. ""Interiors"" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. (""I'm afraid of my anger."" Looking into the middle distance: ""I don't like who I'm becoming."") The directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. (""I read a poem of yours the other day. It was in - I don't know - The New Yorker."" ""Oh. That was an old poem. I reworked it."") Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like Kenneth Branagh in ""Celebrity"").<br /><br />The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's ""Winter Light,"" the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. It all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.<br /><br />Allen's later ""serious"" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining.

"Presenting Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a cute film, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is great as always, but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops all too quickly.<br /><br />I mean, one minute he's ready to beat her butt, but the next minute he falls in love with her. I believe that this production, the film editing, and the script ( even though the photography was great, the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well) could have been a little better. It feels as though the production was too rushed. <br /><br />The supporting cast was good as well, especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter Rosie. She at the age of 11, looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress. She's much better in this film than in her previous films as Warner Brothers in the late 1930's (except for Broadway Musketeers 1938, she's really good in that), when they tried to make her into a Shirley Temple/Sybil Jason hybrid. Overall, this film could better, but in the end, Judy gave it her all.",1,presenting lily mars  mgm  1943  is a cute film  but in my opinion it could have been better  judy garland is great as always  but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly  i mean  one minute hes ready to beat her butt  but the next minute he falls in love with her  i believe that this production  the film editing  and the script   even though the photography was great  the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well  could have been a little better  it feels as though the production was too rushed   the supporting cast was good as well  especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie  she at the age of 11  looks really cute and its a shame that she didnt develop into a teenage comic actress  shes much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930s  except for broadway musketeers 1938  shes really good in that   when they tried to make her into a shirley temple sybil jason hybrid  overall  this film could better  but in the end  judy gave it her all

But my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on, particularly since I could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged.<br /><br />From the beginning to the end this film offends. Worse, it ain't funny. It wasn't funny then, and it sure ain't funny now. But even worse, is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart, sophisticated comedy. It's juvenile, really sophomoric script and ideas began an era (which continues to this day) where cheap laughs, and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film.<br /><br />Sexual Olympics?

"I'm still new to the Krimi genre and the only one I've seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'The Dead Eyes of London', which didn't exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me. If I'd seen this one first, however, the feeling would have been different as while The College Girl Murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick; it's great fun to watch and it's really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style. The film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack. This poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison (and then has them put back in jail). As the title suggests, it's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims. There's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip.<br /><br />Of course, with a plot like that; this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue-in-cheek vibe to the film, which does bode well with the plot. The fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly; although this isn't a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and there's always enough going on to keep the audience interested. The atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at. Of course, the film is based on an Edgar Wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination; the locations used are also superb and while a killer's lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot, it does help to give the film that extra 'something'. You cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film; but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax. Overall, College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended!",1,im still new to the krimi genre and the only one ive seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing the dead eyes of london  which didnt exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me  if id seen this one first  however  the feeling would have been different as while the college girl murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick  its great fun to watch and its really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style  the film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack  this poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison  and then has them put back in jail   as the title suggests  its a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims  theres also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip  of course  with a plot like that  this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue in cheek vibe to the film  which does bode well with the plot  the fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly  although this isnt a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and theres always enough going on to keep the audience interested  the atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at  of course  the film is based on an edgar wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination  the locations used are also superb and while a killers lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot  it does help to give the film that extra something  you cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film  but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax  overall  college girl murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended 
"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**<br /><br />The biggest part of the movie that doesn't work IS the Wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie usually isn't far behind it. The filmmakers' interpretation of the Wendigo's form is interesting, and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror, for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good. However, as a monster character it never really comes to life. We don't get much of an explanation for its behavior, and what we DO see from it doesn't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself, or any Wendigo lore I've ever read.<br /><br />I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do, in the movie. When you boil this film down to its bones, what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element, instead of a movie about a monster.<br /><br />The cinematography is good, though a little cheesy; the filmmakers use scenery, lighting, and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well. The character of Otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster in the film. It might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the Wendigo, which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend.<br /><br />I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason the Wendigo doesn't do much is that, when the monster suit was built, it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable (in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves, the performer had to walk on his toes) that it was nearly impossible to run, walk, or otherwise perform in it. Thus the many flashes of the creature standing still, and the obvious sped-up footage of it running. I stress that these reports are uncomfirmed.",1,  possible spoilers   the biggest part of the movie that doesnt work is the wendigo  and when your title character fails  your movie usually isnt far behind it  the filmmakers interpretation of the wendigos form is interesting  and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly   when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror  for instance   and the tree form was actually very good  however  as a monster character it never really comes to life  we dont get much of an explanation for its behavior  and what we do see from it doesnt jibe with either the story told in the movie itself  or any wendigo lore ive ever read  i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isnt given enough to do  in the movie  when you boil this film down to its bones  what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element  instead of a movie about a monster  the cinematography is good  though a little cheesy  the filmmakers use scenery  lighting  and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well  the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable  making him the real monster in the film  it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo  which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend  i have heard unconfirmed reports  from a newsgroup  that the reason the wendigo doesnt do much is that  when the monster suit was built  it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable  in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves  the performer had to walk on his toes  that it was nearly impossible to run  walk  or otherwise perform in it  thus the many flashes of the creature standing still  and the obvious sped up footage of it running  i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed

"Okay, I'll admit the casting in the film is REALLY strange--part of this is due to the plot, but I still had a bit of trouble believing Pierce Brosnan playing this lead (though he really did a pretty good job).<br /><br />It's based on a true story of an Englishman who went to live with the Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian. He was, in fact, so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks--even though he was not a mixed blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked! The movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered.<br /><br />The acting and settings were great and I really liked the film (once I suspended disbelief about Brosnan). It didn't get widespread distribution--probably because it was pretty cerebral--not a Bond film nor a romance--just a really odd film about a remarkable man.",1,okay  ill admit the casting in the film is really strange  part of this is due to the plot  but i still had a bit of trouble believing pierce brosnan playing this lead  though he really did a pretty good job   its based on a true story of an englishman who went to live with the canadian indians in the early 20th century  he claimed to be a mixed blood indian  he was  in fact  so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks  even though he was not a mixed blood indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked  the movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered  the acting and settings were great and i really liked the film  once i suspended disbelief about brosnan   it didnt get widespread distribution  probably because it was pretty cerebral  not a bond film nor a romance  just a really odd film about a remarkable man 
"This is another one of those 'humans vs insects/eco-horror' features; a theme that was popular in the late 70's. Only you can't really call it horror. There's zero suspense and no gruesome events. In other words: this movie is pretty lame. It's not that it's really bad or something; it's just very boring. A construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants. Later on we learn that, probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past, their bite became poisonous. Some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what's going on. Robert Foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours. Then they flee in the house, waiting to get rescued. And, man, you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them. I won't spoil too much, but at one point they even use a big helicopter. All the time when I was watching this, I sat there thinking ""Come on, people, you all got shoes on. Just run out of the building. I'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you."" It's all pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />Of course, lots of close-ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie. Ants in the garden. Ants in the garbage. Ants in the kitchen. Ants on the roof. Ants in the bedroom. Ants in the sink. And the best part: Ants crawling on people's faces while the actors are breathing through straws. But when you see groups of ants in wider shots, they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall.<br /><br />One small surprise came near the end. No, it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot. It was just that Brian Dennehy made an appearance as a chief-fireman. Ehrr... What more can I say? This movie is called IT HAPPENED AT LAKEWOOD MANOR but the box-art of my copy read ANTS and the title during the opening credits was PANIC AT LAKEWOOD MANOR. There you have it. Now, since this is a made-for-TV movie from the 70's, I'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating. Now, THE SAVAGE BEES, another 'humans vs insects' TV-movie from 1976 was much better than this one. I even feel I have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ANTS. Lacking suspense, action, thrills, shocks and creepiness, the only thing you'll be left with after seeing ANTS is an annoying itch.",0,this is another one of those humans vs insects eco horror features  a theme that was popular in the late 70s  only you cant really call it horror  theres zero suspense and no gruesome events  in other words  this movie is pretty lame  its not that its really bad or something  its just very boring  a construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants  later on we learn that  probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past  their bite became poisonous  some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out whats going on  robert foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours  then they flee in the house  waiting to get rescued  and  man  you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them  i wont spoil too much  but at one point they even use a big helicopter  all the time when i was watching this  i sat there thinking  come on  people  you all got shoes on  just run out of the building  im sure a bunch of ants wont catch up with you   its all pretty ridiculous  of course  lots of close ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie  ants in the garden  ants in the garbage  ants in the kitchen  ants on the roof  ants in the bedroom  ants in the sink  and the best part  ants crawling on peoples faces while the actors are breathing through straws  but when you see groups of ants in wider shots  they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall  one small surprise came near the end  no  it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot  it was just that brian dennehy made an appearance as a chief fireman  ehrr    what more can i say  this movie is called it happened at lakewood manor but the box art of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at lakewood manor  there you have it  now  since this is a made for tv movie from the 70s  ill be once again extremely mild in my final rating  now  the savage bees  another humans vs insects tv movie from 1976 was much better than this one  i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants  lacking suspense  action  thrills  shocks and creepiness  the only thing youll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying itch 
"Jean Claude Van Damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of Universal Soldier. But, did that movie saved him? I think he goes to hell, after he dies. <br /><br />In the first minute, we see the inside of a facility, where you can see the bad guy of the film. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the acting (details are following). <br /><br />Then, we see Van Damme with a black girl (do not remember the name....well it doesn't matter anyway), trying to escape from some muscle-men. Of course they are the new Universal-Soldiers. More muscels, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme fights Goldberg but then the ""mission"" gets aborted. It was just a test (Is this movie a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme works for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (Who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing, that yould Van Dammes character could do). But it is a sequel. And a ""story"" has to come up. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the ""story"".<br /><br />Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project. Of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the facility BUT the computer sends some soldiers hunting him (It wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the film. <br /><br />After some ""story"", Van Damme tries to rescue his daughter (of his wife - the reporter in the first movie). It comes to a final show down where Van Damme fights the Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please see for yourself. It is just too funny to tell).<br /><br />You'll see that this movie is a waste of time.<br /><br />So do not watch it.

"The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. This truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help. I don't know about Britain, but America's made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government's doings.

"When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you don't really find anything. Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, there's really nothing there.

"Whether it's a good movie or not, films of this kind has to be made, i think.

I hope the director will go on stepping across the border, as though i felt the choices Vincenzo Natali made, were not always subtle (some of the scenes were unhappily kind of ""tarte-à-la-crème"", like a childish slapstick), speaking about script and cinematography The color of ""Cube"" was black, ""Nothing"" is white, more cheerful, surprisingly, than the former films of Natali.",1,whether its a good movie or not  films of this kind has to be made  i think  it remembers me of  i love huckabees   a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond  in a merry sadistic masochist way           i hope the director will go on stepping across the border  as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made  were not always subtle  some of the scenes were unhappily kind of  tarte à la crème   like a childish slapstick   speaking about script and cinematography the color of  cube  was black   nothing  is white  more cheerful  surprisingly  than the former films of natali 
"- SMALL SPOILER HEREIN! - <br /><br />When I looked at the votes for ""Creep"" today, I was surprised about so many IMDb-users rating this movie ""1"". I am wondering: what do people expect of such kind of movie? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it?<br /><br />""Creep"" is a HORROR movie and it is a pretty good one! This automatically means: it has a absurd story full of holes, outrageous hazards and simple one-side-characters. So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then... ...enjoy to be scared to death! The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than Kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you. (In my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie.)<br /><br />When Kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (...as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the Discovery Channel!) So, if you want to make yourself a very, very scaring hour. Just watch the first hour of ""Creep"" and then leave the cinema or turn of your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, don't you? The bad guy will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie up to its end, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />...and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema by dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home...",1,  small spoiler herein     when i looked at the votes for  creep  today  i was surprised about so many imdb users rating this movie  1   i am wondering  what do people expect of such kind of movie  are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it   creep  is a horror movie and it is a pretty good one  this automatically means  it has a absurd story full of holes  outrageous hazards and simple one side characters  so why complain about it  just take some popcorn and coke  make yourself comfortable in your seat and then       enjoy to be scared to death  the first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring  there is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you   in my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie   when kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesnt become a bad movie  the second part of the movie is not scary at all  but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed      as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the discovery channel   so  if you want to make yourself a very  very scaring hour  just watch the first hour of  creep  and then leave the cinema or turn of your tv  you know the rest of the story anyway  dont you  the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor  but even if you watch this movie up to its end  you will not be disappointed     and if you want to push anxiety to the next level  do what i did after watching this movie  leave the cinema by dark night  go to the next subway station and take the last train home   
"...........as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book.<br /><br />All the girls in my class were TERRIFIED when the Woman in Black comes through the window and floats over Kidd's bed, although, just before that there is something that also frightened us, which was when Kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow, and he hears a child's voice say ""It's for you"". That scene still haunts me to this day, nearly 7 YEARS after I saw the film.<br /><br />If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM!!!!!!!!",1,           as i was when i saw this movie  i will never watch this movie again  not because it is a bad movie  but because it scared me so much  as i said  i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us  the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book  all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidds bed  although  just before that there is something that also frightened us  which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow  and he hears a childs voice say  its for you   that scene still haunts me to this day  nearly 7 years after i saw the film  if you are easily scared  avoid this film        
"Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There is nothing i didn't like about this film. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job of, not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters. <br /><br />Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there. That you don't have to spend a lot to create something worth watching. There is something to like for everyone. If you've had a terrible roommate. if you've ever picked on a dork in high school. if you've ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film. This is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again once Adam makes a bigger name for himself.

"Oh dear . Yet another example of "" Oireland "" and religion . No doubt we'll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some "" hunky and macho freedom fighters "" from the IRA . Well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later I was in a state of shock . What a superb movie <br /><br />The story starts on the day of the wedding between Sean Cloney and Sheila Kelly in the 1950s . There is a slight problem since they're getting married in the catholic church and that is Sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen Sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they're old enough . The story - Which is set in the 1950s - then jumps forward a few years when the Cloney daughters are about to start school but Sheila has decided they'll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest Father Stafford . From there things escalate <br /><br />Let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both Irish catholic and Scottish protestant heritage I was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life . In fact when it comes to religion I consider myself a Marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people . A LOVE DIVIDED shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe . May I have the temerity to state that if Karl Marx saw this movie he'd love it and call it a masterpiece ? Perhaps I shouldn't since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you <br /><br />In reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort I don't claim to know the exact details of what happened in County Wexford and there's no denying that Father Stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but Sheila isn't blameless herself . Think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s Ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this ? This is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them . Not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives . There's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former IRA man Andy Bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former IRA member ( That makes a change . We're not talking about THE DEVIL'S OWN here ) but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself <br /><br />A LOVE DIVIDED is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself , all of which I agree with . If there's any sort of criticism it's that it feels too much like a TVM rather than a cinematic movie but believe me I can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses",1,oh dear   yet another example of   oireland   and religion   no doubt well be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some   hunky and macho freedom fighters   from the ira   well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock   what a superb movie  the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the 1950s   there is a slight problem since theyre getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when theyre old enough   the story   which is set in the 1950s   then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided theyll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford   from there things escalate  let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life   in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people   a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe   may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie hed love it and call it a masterpiece   perhaps i shouldnt since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you  in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i dont claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and theres no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila isnt blameless herself   think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this   this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them   not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives   theres also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member   that makes a change   were not talking about the devils own here   but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself  a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself   all of which i agree with   if theres any sort of criticism its that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses
"The Gospel of Lou was a major disappointment for me. I had received an E-Mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie. It was neither great nor inspirational. The cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie. A lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also many of the people in the movie were far fetched. The relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear. Also the whole movie has most him one way, and then all of a sudden BAM, he is cured and inspiring people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way that he is living it, but when he changes, he doesn't leave boxing, he teaches others how to box.

"This movie was bad beyond belief. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before, which happened to be its ""world premiere."" I don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point. We all understood by the end. <br /><br />Its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to Bettie Paige, in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies. The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least. A scene would start going then someone would say ""wow you're so great Bettie, why don't we make another movie."" this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a Bettie Paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring than) the normal part of the movie. by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another Bettie Paige movie remake came up. it was that ludicrous. I heard a lot of laughter in that theatre, but people were not laughing with the movie maker, they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure. This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory. <br /><br />I know movies are expensive. I have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else I have ever seen. The movie looks like it was made for $12. The cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience. This movie makes ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" look like Citizen Kane. <br /><br />My friends and I left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured. The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good. Apparently, the previous night, the night of the ""world premiere"" the director/writer/producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie. Bettie Paige's movies were destroyed. They should destroy this movie too.",0,this movie was bad beyond belief  i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival  before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before  which happened to be its  world premiere   i dont think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point  we all understood by the end   its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one  dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige  in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies  the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least  a scene would start going then someone would say  wow youre so great bettie  why dont we make another movie   this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as  and even more boring than  the normal part of the movie  by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up  it was that ludicrous  i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre  but people were not laughing with the movie maker  they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure  this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory   i know movies are expensive  i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen  the movie looks like it was made for  12  the cuts  the graininess  and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience  this movie makes  dude  wheres my car   look like citizen kane   my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured  the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good  apparently  the previous night  the night of the  world premiere  the director writer producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie  bettie paiges movies were destroyed  they should destroy this movie too 
"THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie, a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music) but, sadly, the movie is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion... admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past. Well, in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that it's all merely in her mind and... well, you can probably see where this all is going. You will have figured out what's going on long before our hapless heroine... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and done better, too). To add to the movie's myriad transgressions, most cuts of this movie (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window... she goes to open it... you know she is going to see something scary... and then... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband's arms. So what did she see??? I guess we'll never know.",0,the screaming skull  1 outta 5 stars  this movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits  an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie  a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music  but  sadly  the movie is all downhill from there  a widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion    admonishing his servants and friends that the new mrs  has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past  well  in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can  her husband assures her that its all merely in her mind and    well  you can probably see where this all is going  you will have figured out whats going on long before our hapless heroine    because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and tv shows  and done better  too   to add to the movies myriad transgressions  most cuts of this movie  on numerous cheap dvd compilations  seem to be missing a few key scenes  you see the heroine slowly walking towards the window    she goes to open it    you know she is going to see something scary    and then    suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husbands arms  so what did she see    i guess well never know 
"The fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in Switzerland's film history makes me shake my head! It's true, but pitiful at the same time. A flick about the Swiss army could be a good deal better.<br /><br />The story sounds interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church, wedding his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter).<br /><br />The Acting in some way doesn't really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, personally i found her rather annoying. <br /><br />The storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance, which does not work as expected. The romance-part is too trashy, and the comedy-part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever. It's funny for preadolescent 12-13 year olds, but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy. The humor is weak except for some shots.<br /><br />Dope? Cool! Stealing? Cool! If you want a proper comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you did not absolve your military training yet, and even then don't expect too much!<br /><br />I'll give it 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is quite funny during his screen time. Not a hell of a lot screen time though",0,the fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in switzerlands film history makes me shake my head  its true  but pitiful at the same time  a flick about the swiss army could be a good deal better  the story sounds interesting  at the beginning  antonio carrera  michael koch  gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church  wedding his love laura moretti  mia aegerter   the acting in some way doesnt really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality  melanie winiger plays her role as the strong michelle bluntschi mediocre  personally i found her rather annoying   the storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance  which does not work as expected  the romance part is too trashy  and the comedy part is not funny at all  its just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever  its funny for preadolescent 12 13 year olds  but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy  the humor is weak except for some shots  dope  cool  stealing  cool  if you want a proper comedy about the swiss rs  make sure you did not absolve your military training yet  and even then dont expect too much  ill give it 4 out of 10 stars  because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time  not a hell of a lot screen time though

"This wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do marvelous jobs--with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"").

"I have a high tolerance level for crap, so I was looking forward to this. It did not disappoint. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who, luckily, happens to be travelling with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the General, as he likes to be called here) running over random zombies. Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak? The dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned. We have construction worker zombies, soldier zombies and even St.Trinian schoolgirl zombies. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire. Oh wait there are no vampires, the girl is in a lunatic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa's mad. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing. When are we going to see vampires fight zombies? Is she a vampire or is she a lunatic? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here come the St.Trinian zombies. Chainsaw time!! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires.

"Horrible acting, Bad story line, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes in I decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen... It didn't. (Aside from a nice breast shot) The movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the sets. You even see this same red chair in several different ""locations"" If you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment, not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog.. (Note to producers) Renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable) If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you got it with a return guarantee... You will be demanding your money back...

"This is a movie which attempts a retelling of Thai history, set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this film because I thought it was along the lines of many Thai films I've watched and enjoyed, one that has Thai actors speaking Thai and martial arts craziness. Well, it's none of that. This film is shot entirely in English, is chock full of Anglo actors, and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad....but not funny! Who can we blame for this rubbish? The acting, dialog, and most of the sets were quite bad. Some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect. It has one large, epic-style outdoor battle scene, where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume, but when we see the two armies collide in combat--HA! What a joke! The film does feature a couple of beauties. What a pity they didn't show a little more skin. At least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate.

"There is a certain genius behind this movie. I was laughing throughout. The scene in the phone sex office, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor. Execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent. The doppelganger split at the end was like... ""ok, wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say"". Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.<br /><br />Is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level? i'm easily bored by many movies, but this one kept my interest throughout.<br /><br />I think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess.

"I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like ""the Night of Distaste"". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a lame and low-brain slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's trying to convince himself Intensive Care never happened.",0,i dont know why i keep doing this to myself   i keep on defending the dutch and belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances   and then they smack you around the head with junk like this  intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the dutch speaking countries  its a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise  clearly based on mainstrain american slasher classics such as friday the 13th and halloween  the producers and writers aimed really high with this  but fell really low  intensive care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here  its almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and its only showed on special occasions  like  the night of distaste   for exactly 5 minutes  intensive care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline   then it changes into a lame and low brain slash n stalk movie with gruesome   yet very hilarious and cheap   make up effects  the acting of the entire cast is abominable  even though there are a few respected names involved  the leading male role is played by koen wauters   this guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in belgium  hes a beloved singer  host of tv shows and idol of many young girls  he never ever mentions this thing he starred in  though  like everybody else in the netherlands  hes trying to convince himself intensive care never happened

"I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer, I'm not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I'm concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but I've also seen a lot better.

"If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney's going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever. It even had that spaghetti meatball scene. It's been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry direct to video(the entire concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be(or maybe that's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Don't waste your money on this. True, it's not as horrific as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's little consolation.",0,if theres one thing you can count on disney to do  its their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again  even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience  disneys going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever  it even had that spaghetti meatball scene  its been done before  and thats what i say to this sorry direct to video the entire concept should be banned   everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluths really bad movies  the penguin and walrus duo ive even forgotten their names  are just a really poor carbon copy of timon and pumbaa  morgana is another ursula  she even repeats practically all her old lines  the songs are pathetic  really abysmal  ive never heard songs so bad from them before until now  and the dialogue is atrocious  its pathetic and simplistic  on the plus side  at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent  all of the usual characters arent as annoying as they used to be or maybe thats a minus for little mermaid fans   back on the negative  melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit  i almost did  do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor  dont waste your money on this  true  its not as horrific as return of jafar or pocahontas ii  but thats little consolation

"Easily the best known of all the Shakespeare plays, it has been seriously let down here. Shoddy direction, stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy.<br /><br />In the town of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. Bloodshed soon erupts...<br /><br />The studio work, especially in daytime scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the play. It's a story that, with it's energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. Coupled with this the costumes are hideous, with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces. The stage fighting looks horrendous, with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging.<br /><br />Patrick Ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective Romeo. He manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland, often inexpressive eyes limit his range. It is very hard for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too youthful to be a good Juliet - she captures the character's naiveté but a little more sassiness would have been welcome.<br /><br />The supporting roles don't fare much better. Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera. He gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result. Alan Rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt. He did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years, but that isn't in evidence here. The Prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera. Only Micheal Hordern, in probably his best role in this series, comes out of this with any dignity. His Capulet is well-played and a joy to watch.<br /><br />See one of the other versions of this story instead.",0,easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays  it has been seriously let down here  shoddy direction  stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy  in the town of verona  the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo  patrick rycart   a montague  falls in love with juliet  rebecca saire   a capulet  bloodshed soon erupts    the studio work  especially in daytime scenes  seriously stagnates the energy of the play  its a story that  with its energy  deserves to be shot outdoors  coupled with this the costumes are hideous  with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces  the stage fighting looks horrendous  with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging  patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo  he manages the characters intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland  often inexpressive eyes limit his range  it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo  rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet   she captures the characters naiveté but a little more sassiness would have been welcome  the supporting roles dont fare much better  joseph oconnors friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut  anthony andrews mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera  he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result  alan rickman  underplaying his role  has virtually no presence as tybalt  he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years  but that isnt in evidence here  the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera  only micheal hordern  in probably his best role in this series  comes out of this with any dignity  his capulet is well played and a joy to watch  see one of the other versions of this story instead 
"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? Take your pick -- they're both faultless. Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass.",1,so wonderful  so quirky  so romantic  so italian  the film is so feather  light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again  a kitchen sink world of bakeries  and hairdressers  and plumbing  but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence  should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction  take your pick    theyre both faultless  let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass 
"The only other film besides Soylent Green that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms. On the Beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet.<br /><br />Maybe there's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now. New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming. For myself it also shows the Right to Life ethic run amuck. Obviously there's no family planning in this world either.<br /><br />Charlton Heston is an NYPD detective who lives with room mate Edward G. Robinson who's old enough to remember the Earth before catastrophe struck. There's been a murder committed, Joseph Cotten an executive with the Soylent Corporation, a multi-national concern that has come up with a food product, some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population. It's latest product is Soylent Green.<br /><br />The investigation finds Charlton Heston getting his man, but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of mankind. As Heston shouts in the end that Soylent Green is made of people, that we've become a race of cannibals, the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative. We've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.<br /><br />This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke movingly of Robinson even though they had differing political views. A few weeks after Robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia, he passed away in real life. Not many did, but Heston knew that Robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them.<br /><br />Though the timetable was off, it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not come to pass. Hopefully we'll have not just the intelligence, but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening.",1,the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach  both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms  on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet  maybe theres cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we havent reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now  new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green  environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming  for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck  obviously theres no family planning in this world either  charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g  robinson whos old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck  theres been a murder committed  joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation  a multi national concern that has come up with a food product  some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the worlds population  its latest product is soylent green  the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man  but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind  as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people  that weve become a race of cannibals  the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative  weve exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive  this was the farewell performance of edward g  robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views  a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia  he passed away in real life  not many did  but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them  though the timetable was off  it doesnt mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass  hopefully well have not just the intelligence  but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening 
"When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development what-so-ever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it's a film, but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before, kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.<br /><br />Donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. It's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life, she's even going to her senior prom. But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are. Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with. Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. I know that this was a PG-13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? Not to mention no stab holes? I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but I don't understand how anyone could.<br /><br />2/10",0,when i first saw the trailer for prom night  i have to admit  the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie  so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film  not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people  there was no tension  the characters  how was i supposed to care about them  they had no development what so ever  the killer   oh  my god  this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed  i know its a film  but why would a man who never or at least we know of  killed any one before  kill a girls family and friends that hes just obsessed over  i mean  was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her  i have no idea  because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror  donnas family was just brutally murdered by her teacher  who has become very obsessed over her  he was captured and put in jail  its been 3 years and shes just now getting some peace in her life  shes even going to her senior prom  but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind  he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends  and the hotel maid  and the bell boy  because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employees are  donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un noticed and can kill people so silently  just  wow  im sorry  i really did want to love this movie  we havent had a good slasher flick in a long time  but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with  just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious  i know that this was a pg 13 movie  but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes  not to mention no stab holes  i wouldnt recommend this movie for anyone unless youre a teen  this movie was made for the teenagers  not adults  and not for those who know a real horror movie  no offense to those who did enjoy this film  but i dont understand how anyone could  2 10
"This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a grim, sad waste of time.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just sucked. Slow doesn't make the movie bad, it was just bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep.

"It's a great American martial arts movie. The fighting scenes were pretty impressive for American movie made in 90's. Of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in Honk Kong movies, actually only few American movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in Honk Kong movies, even nowadays. When you watch American martial arts movie, you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes, but still having some nice moves, which can be surprisingly good sometimes, or at least that's what I'm expecting from these movies. I was impressed by this film. Some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, direction and the plot were good enough, so it's a really worth watching movie, if you like American martial arts films of the 90's.",1,its a great american martial arts movie  the fighting scenes were pretty impressive for american movie made in 90s  of course the fighting scenes arent that good as in honk kong movies  actually only few american movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in honk kong movies  even nowadays  when you watch american martial arts movie  you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes  but still having some nice moves  which can be surprisingly good sometimes  or at least thats what im expecting from these movies  i was impressed by this film  some fighting scenes were really impressive  the acting  direction and the plot were good enough  so its a really worth watching movie  if you like american martial arts films of the 90s 
"If this had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series it could have been one of the best. It is good enough, as most of them are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is unusually intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of Grange; both run afoul of the usual local gangsters, who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land; their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites. (He also resembles Dracula, as the villains in the later Zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do.) These characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against Zatoichi as he was drawn originally, but by now he has lost many of his nuances, and the changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man Zatoichi has killed, need more time then the movie has to give, so that the story seems choppy, as if some scenes were missing. Other than that, the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a vivid, believable, and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it), and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist. And of course there is the keynote actor, whose presence, as much as his performance, makes it all work. This must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history.",1,if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best  it is good enough  as most of them are  but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point  the situation is unusually intriguing  the farmers in the province have two champions  a benevolent boss  for once  and a philosopher samurai who starts a sort of grange  both run afoul of the usual local gangsters  who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land  their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites   he also resembles dracula  as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do   these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally  but by now he has lost many of his nuances  and the changes in some of the characters  such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed  need more time then the movie has to give  so that the story seems choppy  as if some scenes were missing  other than that  the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series  good acting  sometimes lyrical photography  the creation of a vivid  believable  and uniquely recognizable landscape  the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it   and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself  the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist  and of course there is the keynote actor  whose presence  as much as his performance  makes it all work  this must be one of the best sustained series in movie history 
"""If I sit down I will never stand up again"", that's what the mother (the one of the title) says to his son when he tells her to get some rest (she's just widowed). He means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do: to rest in peace, to neglect herself. But she's not in the mood for ""resting"", not yet. She also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life... Suddenly, the revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the brand new James Bond) when she ""thought nobody would ever touch her again"". It is a story that makes you reflect on many things, specially on what's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies. It doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects. I mean, nobody's surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones... but what would you think if it was otherwise? An old woman, a young guy... nah, you ain't ready for that, are you?<br /><br />The movie has intimist tones all along its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul-mouthed dialogs. Those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother's love affair (pretty absurd -you'll know what I mean when you watch it-) are the only discordant elements in ""The Mother"". <br /><br />*My rate: 7/10",1, if i sit down i will never stand up again   thats what the mother  the one of the title  says to his son when he tells her to get some rest  shes just widowed   he means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do  to rest in peace  to neglect herself  but shes not in the mood for  resting   not yet  she also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life    suddenly  the revelation comes  sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her  daniel craig  the brand new james bond  when she  thought nobody would ever touch her again   it is a story that makes you reflect on many things  specially on whats a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies  it doesnt look that weve advanced that such in those aspects  i mean  nobodys surprised when sean connery has a love affair in a movie with catherine zeta jones    but what would you think if it was otherwise  an old woman  a young guy    nah  you aint ready for that  are you  the movie has intimist tones all along its length  except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul mouthed dialogs  those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mothers love affair  pretty absurd  youll know what i mean when you watch it   are the only discordant elements in  the mother     my rate  7 10
"I've always liked Fred MacMurray, andalthough her career was tragically cut shortI think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Pair these two major and attractive stars together, add top supporting players like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, team them with noted director Mitchell Leisen and you geta mediocre movie experience.<br /><br />Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) ""meet cute"" during her visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid's a great trumpeter, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall. During his climb to musical stardom, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start over after he's hit rock bottom. Ah, yesit's the true Hollywood happy ending, which comes none too soon.<br /><br />Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it's difficult to watch at times. The early scenes set in Panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever, and later an alcoholic Skid just wanders endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but the tired script and S-L-O-W direction just don't give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, just doesn't ring true.<br /><br />This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars MacMurray and Lombard. However, I guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours.",0,ive always liked fred macmurray  andalthough her career was tragically cut shorti think carole lombard is fun to watch  pair these two major and attractive stars together  add top supporting players like jean dixon  anthony quinn  dorothy lamour and charles butterworth  give them a romantic script  team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you geta mediocre movie experience  skid johnson  fred  and maggie  carole   meet cute  during her visit to the panama canal  and spend the next few weeks falling in love  skids a great trumpeter  so he embarks on a musical career  which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall  during his climb to musical stardom  he neglects maggie  who later inspires him to start over after hes hit rock bottom  ah  yesits the true hollywood happy ending  which comes none too soon  stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success  but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that its difficult to watch at times  the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever  and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york  fred and carole try their best  but the tired script and s l o w direction just dont give them a chance  even the final scene  in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment  just doesnt ring true  this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard  however  i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours

"Although the movie is clearly dated, audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless Buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale. Buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages: the Stone Age, The Roman Age, and the Moden Age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different ""ages"". In this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the ""caveman"" stereotype, who wins his love not by romance but by brute force, as well as a funny twist on Roman gladiatorial combat, two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as Mel Brooks' ""History of the World: Part I"". The underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing: Although the times may have-a-changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to ""win the girl"" (keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism was still en vogue). It is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's ""modern times"" to now.",1,although the movie is clearly dated  audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale  buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages  the stone age  the roman age  and the moden age  playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different  ages   in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the  caveman  stereotype  who wins his love not by romance but by brute force  as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat  two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks  history of the world  part i   the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing  although the times may have a changed  we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to  win the girl   keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 america  a time when chauvinism was still en vogue   it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later  and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movies  modern times  to now 
"This movie was so great! I am a teenager, and I and my friends all love the series, so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says: ""rosy cheeks"", when he is talking about his baby daughter. He is such a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They pair up so well, and have such a great chemistry! I really hope that they can work again together. They are such attractive people, and are very good actors. I have finally found movies that are good to watch. Lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good, and show good morals, and Christian values.

"Having low expectations going in, the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'Husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. I won't say the new footage was grade A material, but it provided a very solid foundation for what ""could have been"" a good all-original film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a time of one day shooting schedules. After the new footage, Jules White decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' into this short, making for a not-so-smooth story transition, which Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end, giving us the old, worn-out ending of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) getting shot in the butt.<br /><br />3/10",0,having low expectations going in  the opening new footage  clocked at over five minutes  of husbands came as a pleasant surprise  i wont say the new footage was grade a material  but it provided a very solid foundation for what  could have been  a good all original film  unfortunately  this was put together in 1955  during a time of one day shooting schedules  after the new footage  jules white decided to just thumbtack stock footage from brideless groom into this short  making for a not so smooth story transition  which jules and felix adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end  giving us the old  worn out ending of the boys  moe   larry in this case  getting shot in the butt  3 10
"About 1986 I saw this movie by accident on TV one night. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to Don't Look Now in 1987. I went to Venice on holiday the next year in silent terror, hoping to god that my parents wouldn't find out I'd watched it! <br /><br />Would I have minded if my parents knew I'd watched Les Valseuses when I was a kid? I'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays, and my mum's probably disapproving in the afterlife. I don't know if they'd want to see it anyway. From the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes I'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself. <br /><br />It's definitely violent. It has a violent view of sex, virtually no acknowledgement of love. Even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation. But the scenario IS very erotic and (god I'm so British) arousing! Do they suck her breasts for her own good? That is exploitation. So why am I getting a woody?<br /><br />The fellows go in search of an experienced older woman, find an ex-con, mother-figure? I don't know. It ends in a truly gruesome suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has Cannibal Holocaust-guts, and he went eeuurrgghh! No motherly love for this movie, quite the opposite. Mutilation of where the boys began. Why do they shoot the girl in the leg? Why does she come back to them? Do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men?<br /><br />I'm thinking of two movies, one of which I wish I'd never seen, the other makes me wish it wasn't such a harsh world. Swept Away/Madonna what a pile of insanity doesn't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation! Once Upon A Time In America/Leone god why does Noodles do it? Destroys the path to joy we've been following him on his whole life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why?<br /><br />There is no rape in Les Valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance, of both sexes. Very honest, no titillation. No fantasy shags, no perfect Hollywood smooth moves. Jokes, yes. But there's too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy. Forget Carry On Shooting A Naked Hairdresser In The Leg Cos She'll Come Back & You'll Hook Her Up With Your Ex-con Lover's Vengeant Son & She'll Learn How To Cum From Him.<br /><br />Two things I can't stand are rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseuses isn't a rape movie! God nobody's going to want to watch it now! It is a brilliant movie!",1,about 1986 i saw this movie by accident on tv one night  i was 6 years old  it was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to dont look now in 1987  i went to venice on holiday the next year in silent terror  hoping to god that my parents wouldnt find out id watched it   would i have minded if my parents knew id watched les valseuses when i was a kid  id probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays  and my mums probably disapproving in the afterlife  i dont know if theyd want to see it anyway  from the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes im never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if its a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself   its definitely violent  it has a violent view of sex  virtually no acknowledgement of love  even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation  but the scenario is very erotic and  god im so british  arousing  do they suck her breasts for her own good  that is exploitation  so why am i getting a woody  the fellows go in search of an experienced older woman  find an ex con  mother figure  i dont know  it ends in a truly gruesome suicide  i described it to my friend jb nelson  who has cannibal holocaust guts  and he went eeuurrgghh  no motherly love for this movie  quite the opposite  mutilation of where the boys began  why do they shoot the girl in the leg  why does she come back to them  do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men  im thinking of two movies  one of which i wish id never seen  the other makes me wish it wasnt such a harsh world  swept away madonna what a pile of insanity doesnt compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation  once upon a time in america leone god why does noodles do it  destroys the path to joy weve been following him on his whole life  so close to finally finding love with deborah  now they are both destroyed  why sergio  why  there is no rape in les valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance  of both sexes  very honest  no titillation  no fantasy shags  no perfect hollywood smooth moves  jokes  yes  but theres too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy  forget carry on shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg cos shell come back   youll hook her up with your ex con lovers vengeant son   shell learn how to cum from him  two things i cant stand are rape movies and prison movies  les valseuses isnt a rape movie  god nobodys going to want to watch it now  it is a brilliant movie 
"Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a news stand, and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station. And he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many) but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism, and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas.",0,within the first few minutes of this dutch thriller  we learn that krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear  fantasizes about murdering his roommate  tries to steal a magazine from a news stand  and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station  and hes the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up  except for krabbe in at least one scene too many  but has nowhere to go  the basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion  verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations  overt symbolism  and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas

For example: the ""name should scream don't watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar?"" <br /><br />There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar. It's just not Canadian standard English grammar. Comments about the dialogue seem off to me. I put on the subtitles because I'm a Canadian standard English speaker, so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it. It wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies I have seen were so American.<br /><br />I loved that this movie was set in Toronto and, in fact, wish it was even more clearly set there. I loved that the heroine was so atypically cast. I enjoyed the stepping routines. I liked the driven Mum character. I felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies.<br /><br />In summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then this is a decent one.

"First off, I'm not here to dog this movie. I find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality. The acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them, although the monster itself is quite well done...impressively well done, at that. He actually looks kind of other-worldly, like an alien family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while dad was out taking a ... attending to nature's call, Spot got loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him down. That, or he's the Caucasian brother of the Wishmaster. I haven't decided which.<br /><br />Actually, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country, yes, but more likely Canada somewhere than China anywhere. The trees and vistas say Canada to me, and it's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber-coldness one might expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location.<br /><br />Further, apparently (as we have just established) Sci-Fi directors do not travel often, as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened. But as I said, it's a Sci-Fi Channel movie so we must forgive a few things.<br /><br />The movie is pretty graphic at times, and rotates between ""Alive"" about the Donner Party, ""Predator"" about the alien in the woods, and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires. The Yeti apparently can leap about like Spiderman...or Super Mario...remember? ""Run faster! Jump higher! Live longer!"" <br /><br />Also, the Yeti has missed his teddy bear. He's searched high and low for it, but cannot seem to make a cadaver work. Poor Yeti! You can't help but feel sorry for it. It has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss. He's missed his bear. Or maybe it wants to mate, but that thought is BANISHED! Do ya hear me? Well, it does seem to be an unmated male. REBANISHED! <br /><br />And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human...it's super-Yeti! But then again, what's normal-Yeti? I don't know, but he has a definite Michael Meyers quality that is completely unsettling. And he's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur. FABulous Dahlink! It's spotlessly white at times when it SO shouldn't be. He's fastidiously superhu-...super-Yeti.<br /><br />All in all? This was a lot of fun to watch, has some great kills and a few honest plot elements. In spite of the horribly gravel-like production style, this is actually quite entertaining. I can't help wondering if they're planning on another one? <br /><br />It rates a 6.0/10 on the M4TV Scale.<br /><br />It rates a 4.4/10 on the Movie Scale from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.",0,first off  im not here to dog this movie  i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality  the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them  although the monster itself is quite well done   impressively well done  at that  he actually looks kind of other worldly  like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a     attending to natures call  spot got loose and they just didnt have time to hunt him down  that  or hes the caucasian brother of the wishmaster  i havent decided which  actually  this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country  yes  but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere  the trees and vistas say canada to me  and its okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber coldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china  its a sci fi channel movie  so we can forgive the lack of location  further  apparently  as we have just established  sci fi directors do not travel often  as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened  but as i said  its a sci fi channel movie so we must forgive a few things  the movie is pretty graphic at times  and rotates between  alive  about the donner party   predator  about the alien in the woods  and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires  the yeti apparently can leap about like spiderman   or super mario   remember   run faster  jump higher  live longer    also  the yeti has missed his teddy bear  hes searched high and low for it  but cannot seem to make a cadaver work  poor yeti  you cant help but feel sorry for it  it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss  hes missed his bear  or maybe it wants to mate  but that thought is banished  do ya hear me  well  it does seem to be an unmated male  rebanished   and its superhuman  well  its not human   its super yeti  but then again  whats normal yeti  i dont know  but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling  and hes got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur  fabulous dahlink  its spotlessly white at times when it so shouldnt be  hes fastidiously superhu    super yeti  all in all  this was a lot of fun to watch  has some great kills and a few honest plot elements  in spite of the horribly gravel like production style  this is actually quite entertaining  i cant help wondering if theyre planning on another one   it rates a 6 0 10 on the m4tv scale  it rates a 4 4 10 on the movie scale from    the fiend

"Having seen most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. It's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters.

"This quasi J-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of Shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends. She finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike stellar J-horror films, the suspense doesn't really build, the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd.<br /><br />This movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy. Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long.

"The thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein; and there's a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film. The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth. His discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it. However, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him mad...<br /><br />The biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and both give excellent performances. Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for Karloff to impress with. Bela Lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in, and it's a great performance from him also; it's nice to see a bit of versatility from Lugosi. The film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up. The second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). The film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well. The film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely. Overall, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but it's a very good one and comes recommended.",1,the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein  and theres a very good reason for that  but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions  and the invisible ray is certainly one of them  the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before  even way back in 1936  but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director lambert hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film  the plot focuses on the good hearted dr janos rukh  a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth  his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it  however  tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element  which makes him glow in the dark  and also sends him mad    the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day   boris karloff and bela lugosi  and both give excellent performances  karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with  bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what were used to seeing him in  and its a great performance from him also  its nice to see a bit of versatility from lugosi  the film does get off to a rather slow start  but things soon start to pick up  the second half of the film is the best and thats really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine  literally   the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting  and it does work very well  the film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely  overall  the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties  but its a very good one and comes recommended 
"Almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in China. There are no fancy sets, explosion or glamorous people--only fine writing, acting and direction (Hollywood, take note!).<br /><br />An estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying. He is surprised to see that Dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual. In fact, he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse. How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable.<br /><br />I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is an action picture (such as those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), as I don't particularly care for these frenetic films. The Shower as well as Springtime In A Small Town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE!",1,almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in china  there are no fancy sets  explosion or glamorous people  only fine writing  acting and direction  hollywood  take note    an estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying  he is surprised to see that dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual  in fact  he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop  dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesnt really see the value of the old bathhouse  how their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable  i was happy to see that not every chinese movie is an action picture  such as those starring jet li or crouching tiger  hidden dragon   as i dont particularly care for these frenetic films  the shower as well as springtime in a small town are two wonderful examples of good chinese films about people 
"Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends, they both are the leads in their own respective bands; Anton with The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney with The Dandy Warhols. What's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals; its a love hate relationship. At times you both hear them praising one another, but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are. While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success, BJM still was stuck in the underground scene; and for good reason why.<br /><br />The focus of Dig! is more towards Anton and the BJM, as they have a lot more substance. They are the most dysfunctional band. During gigs they will fight and bash each other. Anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly. With the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume, fight was always waiting to happen. You know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens; that's why people would go to their gigs, for the fights. <br /><br />Anton is very unstable. Always thinking himself as a music messiah, he wants to change music and create a revolution, but he could never get out of the underground. He is a very talented musician, its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill. But his draw back is he cant escape the world he created; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs, alcohol and depression. On the other side, the Dandy Warhols were having their own troubles. They didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label. But they found huge success in Europe. But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton. Its interesting that both Anton and Courtney both had what the other needed. Courtney always wanted to be musically talented as Anton, though Anton wouldn't say it, he needed the commercial success that the Dandy's had, to make his revolution.<br /><br />Over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands, there is a lot of footage. There is never a dull moment in Dig!. It is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say, seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job. Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more. Even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure.<br /><br />You wont be disappointed.",1,anton newcombe and courtney taylor are friends  they both are the leads in their own respective bands  anton with the brian jonestown massacre and courtney with the dandy warhols  whats interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals  its a love hate relationship  at times you both hear them praising one another  but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are  while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success  bjm still was stuck in the underground scene  and for good reason why  the focus of dig  is more towards anton and the bjm  as they have a lot more substance  they are the most dysfunctional band  during gigs they will fight and bash each other  anton will hit other members if he feels they arent performing correctly  with the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume  fight was always waiting to happen  you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens  thats why people would go to their gigs  for the fights   anton is very unstable  always thinking himself as a music messiah  he wants to change music and create a revolution  but he could never get out of the underground  he is a very talented musician  its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill  but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created  a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs  alcohol and depression  on the other side  the dandy warhols were having their own troubles  they didnt find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label  but they found huge success in europe  but courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of anton  its interesting that both anton and courtney both had what the other needed  courtney always wanted to be musically talented as anton  though anton wouldnt say it  he needed the commercial success that the dandys had  to make his revolution  over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands  there is a lot of footage  there is never a dull moment in dig   it is constantly moving along as it doesnt have time to slow down as it has to much to say  seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job  ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more  even if you dont like the bands it still deserves viewing  it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure  you wont be disappointed 
"I would strongly recommend this film for any musical fan whose been dying to see a musical make a faithful transition from stage to screen. Sure it's long, but it's length is a testimony to how true to the original musical script the film is being. The sets and cast really make Sweet Apple, Ohio the place to be. Fosse protege Anne Reinking also does a splendid job with choreography giving the dances a nice small town, period feel.<br /><br />The casting at a glance may look strange to some but they really are qute marvelous(reading ""annonymous""'s comments on Jason Alexander's performance made me sick). In fact, his perforamnce literally steals the show. As Albert, he mixes his own unique blend of manic nervousness with Dick Van Dyke-esque charm to create a new and improved Albert. The fact that he can dance and sing like nobody's business doeesn't hurt either. George Wendt is another stand out, who improves upon Paul Lynde's take on Harry McAffe by making him less manic and more down to Earth and strict. His whole character and body language scream ""over my dead body"". Marc Kudisch takes the Elvis aspect of Conrad Birdie to new heights with his subtle insertion of a ""thank you very much"" in ""Honestly Sincere"". His physicality though harkens back more to young Elvis then the bloated, stubly Conrad of the original film. The fact is that this movie differs so greatly from the original film (which added drawn in happpy faces, turtles on speed and the Russian ballet!!!) what did any of taht have to do with Bye, Bye Birdie, I wonder? The only possible advantage the original version has over this one is Ann Margret. Otherwise the update is better in every possible way. Where the old version cut many songs and increased dance breaks nwhere there was no need for them (and for all intents and purposes ended the movie in the middle of the play), the new version has restored the original music score and has added some great new stuff as well (""A Giant Step"" being the standout in that category). We know live in trying times but if you want to get your mind off your troubles and put on a happy face then this is one worth checking out.",1,i would strongly recommend this film for any musical fan whose been dying to see a musical make a faithful transition from stage to screen  sure its long  but its length is a testimony to how true to the original musical script the film is being  the sets and cast really make sweet apple  ohio the place to be  fosse protege anne reinking also does a splendid job with choreography giving the dances a nice small town  period feel  the casting at a glance may look strange to some but they really are qute marvelous reading  annonymous s comments on jason alexanders performance made me sick   in fact  his perforamnce literally steals the show  as albert  he mixes his own unique blend of manic nervousness with dick van dyke esque charm to create a new and improved albert  the fact that he can dance and sing like nobodys business doeesnt hurt either  george wendt is another stand out  who improves upon paul lyndes take on harry mcaffe by making him less manic and more down to earth and strict  his whole character and body language scream  over my dead body   marc kudisch takes the elvis aspect of conrad birdie to new heights with his subtle insertion of a  thank you very much  in  honestly sincere   his physicality though harkens back more to young elvis then the bloated  stubly conrad of the original film  the fact is that this movie differs so greatly from the original film  which added drawn in happpy faces  turtles on speed and the russian ballet     what did any of taht have to do with bye  bye birdie  i wonder  the only possible advantage the original version has over this one is ann margret  otherwise the update is better in every possible way  where the old version cut many songs and increased dance breaks nwhere there was no need for them  and for all intents and purposes ended the movie in the middle of the play   the new version has restored the original music score and has added some great new stuff as well   a giant step  being the standout in that category   we know live in trying times but if you want to get your mind off your troubles and put on a happy face then this is one worth checking out 
"What a movie! I never imagined Richard Attenborough could have such a movie in him. Gandhi has always left me indifferent, apart from Ben Kingsley's performance, and I never considered Attenborough a particularly good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times. It's an exciting, mesmerizing political movie with great performances by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington.<br /><br />Kline plays Donald Woods, a South Africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist Steve Biko. It starts as a difficult friendship, for Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites. But Biko, with his kind words, upbeat attitude and complete transparency, wins over Woods and introduces him to a reality about Apartheid that Woods knew nothing about.<br /><br />Biko is a decent, law-abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people. One night, coming from an illegal meeting, he's arrested and beaten to death. The authorities try to hush up the matter because Biko has become a huge personality in South Africa. But through the efforts of Woods the truth comes out. But what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as Woods and his family become targets for the secret police.<br /><br />This movie has an interesting structure. It has in fact two narratives: first it narrates the life and death of Biko. It's an amazing first half, completely dominated by the charisma of Washington in what may be his greatest performance yet.<br /><br />The second half, no less interesting, narrates Woods attempt to escape from South Africa to publish a book about Biko. Woods has become an enemy of state, a banned person, which means he can't meet people or leave his country. Plus he's constantly spied by the police. Kevin Kline gives a great performance in this second half too.<br /><br />Although the first half is quite straightforward, the second does interesting things with editing, by giving flashbacks of Biko and of events that show the repression against the black South Africans. Some may argue this is to make it more interesting, but for me the second half just as captivating, as Woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape South Africa.<br /><br />The last minutes were so heartbreaking I was in tears. George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it. Although I've never been much of a fan of Fenton (cannot stand his Gandhi score), I do think the score for Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema. The movie, thanks to the music married to the powerful images, at times reached incredible peaks of emotion.<br /><br />Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of Denzel Washington. This is a movie to be cherished in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. This movie deserve a place alongside movies like The Pianist, Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.",1,what a movie  i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him  gandhi has always left me indifferent  apart from ben kingsleys performance  and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker  but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times  its an exciting  mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washington  kline plays donald woods  a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko  it starts as a difficult friendship  for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites  but biko  with his kind words  upbeat attitude and complete transparency  wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about  biko is a decent  law abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people  one night  coming from an illegal meeting  hes arrested and beaten to death  the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa  but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out  but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police  this movie has an interesting structure  it has in fact two narratives  first it narrates the life and death of biko  its an amazing first half  completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet  the second half  no less interesting  narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko  woods has become an enemy of state  a banned person  which means he cant meet people or leave his country  plus hes constantly spied by the police  kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too  although the first half is quite straightforward  the second does interesting things with editing  by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans  some may argue this is to make it more interesting  but for me the second half just as captivating  as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africa  the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears  george fenton and jonas gwangwas score certainly had something to do with it  although ive never been much of a fan of fenton  cannot stand his gandhi score   i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema  the movie  thanks to the music married to the powerful images  at times reached incredible peaks of emotion  cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington  this is a movie to be cherished in its entirety  acting  writing  music  editing  cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit  this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the pianist  life is beautiful and the shawshank redemption 
"What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean firstly I love Seagal. I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s. His early stuff is some of the best in the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form. However, what we get is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug. What happened in this movie. The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace, a shambles and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is terrible. This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera! ""Revenge is a two way street"" seagal says in this movie...well forget revenge Steven, you need redemption!",0,what was steven seagal thinking  i mean firstly i love seagal  i love all his movies up to the mid 2000s  his early stuff is some of the best in the genre  this however does not live up to its excellent name  attack force  with protagonist marshall lawson  seagal   would be expected to be a mindless action movie with seagal in typical one liner ass kicking form  however  what we get is a crime mystery  bordering on a political thriller with little or no action  seagal is always in shadows because of his weight  i could not follow this story  theres people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug  what happened in this movie  the dubbing of seagal is a disgrace  a shambles and a shame  why dub the man  the story is terrible  this got a 2 10 from me because of the scene where seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him  and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera   revenge is a two way street  seagal says in this movie   well forget revenge steven  you need redemption 
"In case you're a self-acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and/or bad movie-making, there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"". It's an inescapable certainty, as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made. One tiny but essential detail, however, is that ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" is deliberately awful. Right from the opening message already, mocking Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"", this is clearly intended as a zero-budgeted parody and I can't escape the impression that writer/director John De Bello never expected for his film to become such a hit. The film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so-called ""eco-horror"" movies (plants, animals and nature in general revolting against humanity) and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines. A secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato-attacks coming from all over the country. The president puts together a Special Forces team to battle the juicy enemy, which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices. The first half hour of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" is very entertaining. As silly as it is, the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny. The first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song, the ""Jaws"" homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash (see the trivia section for more details) that made it to the final cut. After that, however, the whole thing turns into a tedious, unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess. The quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots. Personally, I prefer the late 80's and early 90's sequels (which I saw before seeing the original) because they benefit from slightly better production values, incredibly over-the-top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor John Astin (""The Addams Family"") as the mad scientist Dr. Gangreen.

"Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week. This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town. They aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion.<br /><br />The TV version was (for its time) grim. No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down. The unrated version is even worse--there's plentiful nudity, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard ""uses"" her. YUCK! There's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink. You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it. The needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good--but that actually makes the movie harder to watch. A sick, sleazy film.

"The Horror Channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn Gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning, but their 'scare' factor is very limited, if one exists at all. In fact I am sure I will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer.<br /><br />The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves special mention because it is I feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of lows. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site, I will at least give it a go.<br /><br />Firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact the film might as well have been called 'Toothbrush' or 'Wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.<br /><br />There are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here.<br /><br />A more suitable title would have been, 'Horny Italian Count Leads Five People to a Scary Castle and Bores us Silly for Ninety Minutes.'

"I picked this up in the 'Danger After Dark' box set, and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in America. Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) develops through the movie as a person. The acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards.<br /><br />On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film I've seen him in is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. So, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised by him.<br /><br />But don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. That Hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. It's a really moving picture at some points, the photography is really well done. It's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at Blockbuster.",1,i picked this up in the danger after dark box set  and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt  i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore fest and with very bad dialogue  which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america  instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters  and the way that sho  gackt  develops through the movie as a person  the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good  considering they arent professional actors  and the director did a marvelous job with it all  setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards  on a side note  taro yamamotos performance was very surprising  the only other film ive seen him in is battle royale  where he plays shogo kawada  and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo  toshi is bright  exuberant and hyper  serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics  shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it  so  watch out for his performance  if youre familiar with battle royale  youll be very surprised by him  but dont be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box  because this isnt really a vampire movie  its just a movie with a vampire in it  that hydes character is a vampire is almost a background fact with whats really going on in the foreground  and you guys will love the last scene  its a really moving picture at some points  the photography is really well done  its definitely something to pick up the next time youre at blockbuster

"I have a lot of time for all the Columbo films, but this one in particular was extremely well written, and the solution at the end very effective. However, my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film, between Columbo and the murderer (I apologise if I've not remembered every detail of this exactly). It's the most striking image of Columbo I've seen: the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered, and into the room beyond, which is lit up by daylight. Columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair facing the doorway (and us), contemplating the cupboard, and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light. There's no sound. The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him. He's deep in meditation, puffing gently on a cigar, swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks. Then the dialogue starts.

I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything I expected it to be and more.This is the way a proper horror movie should be.I think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic. The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out.It was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated.The special effects were very good.I would love to see more horror movies like this one.This is easily one of my favorite's.A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie.Other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches.I will be adding it to my collection.The DVD has some interesting special features.,1,i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more this is the way a proper horror movie should be i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic  the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated the special effects were very good i would love to see more horror movies like this one this is easily one of my favorites a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches i will be adding it to my collection the dvd has some interesting special features 
"What a night. Perry Mason then Have Gun, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was a half hour) and finally at 10:30PM came 'Sea Hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and Mike's boat sailing off to a new adventure. Terrific.. Regardless of the story it was the lead character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A Man's Man and a Boy's Man.

"While watching the film, I'm not sure what direstion it was to take. There's a reason a writer shouldn't direct his work and even act in it as well, you can't do it all. I felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats. Ms. McTeer is the film. To add to her amazing talents, her portrayal of this woman was why I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my view, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt this film didn't have that. Everything was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted. Watch the film for the sweetness, but most of all for Ms. McTeer's brilliant performance.",0,while watching the film  im not sure what direstion it was to take  theres a reason a writer shouldnt direct his work and even act in it as well  you cant do it all  i felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats  ms  mcteer is the film  to add to her amazing talents  her portrayal of this woman was why i was engaged  here is a british actress who can do anything  in my view  conflict is what makes drama and a great story  i felt this film didnt have that  everything was somewhat easy for the characters  there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted  watch the film for the sweetness  but most of all for ms  mcteers brilliant performance 
"Ching Siu Tung's and Tsui Hark's A Chinese Ghost Story, aside from being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film lover's collection. The sorely missed Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple. While staying at the temple, he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Tree Devil, and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the lovely Joey Wong.<br /><br />To free her from the clutches of the evil Tree Devil, he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon.<br /><br />Enough good things can't be said about this film. The pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended much too soon) really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. Indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life, I would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His over-the-top persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score, lush cinematography with eye popping colors, and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung round out this wonderful film.

"I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile. No T&A. No great jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. The only thing that was interesting, to me, was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them. Yep, I watched this movie that much back then! <br /><br />The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say. :(",0,i used to love this movie as a kid but  seeing it again 20  years later  it actually sucks  up the academy might have been ahead of its time back in 1980  but it has almost nothing to offer today  movies like caddyshack and stripes hold up much better today than this steaming dogpile  no t a  no great jokes except for the one liners weve all heard a million times by now  i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being  well  i was way off  the soundtrack had only 2 3 widely recognizable hits  not the smash compilation others had mentioned  and the frequent voice overs were terrible  the only thing that was interesting  to me  was predicting what the characters lines were before they said them  yep  i watched this movie that much back then   the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten  sorry to say    
Revenge on us the viewing public perhaps. I sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title. But Costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends. I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film. I had a choice of seeing this or Black Rain at the cinema thankfully i saw The other brothers movie at the cinema instead.i caught up with this turkey on video. there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune.

"Anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying. There weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. Virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby, lily-livered, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of ""political correctness"". <br /><br />The performances across the board were compelling. I sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. In particular, I found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films I've seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. The lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that Dirty Harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end.

"Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and characters? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting. Why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why couldn't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better.

"I thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it. The actors were on top of their character's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great. The music was lush and well-thought-out. It even had a decent twist of an ending. So what's with everyone voting it down? The story wasn't entirely fresh (felt like a remnant of ""Running Man"" with the whole television show idea), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public picks their Messiah certainly sounded true enough. It made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity.<br /><br />It's possible that Christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word ""God"" in it, but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this, especially in the modern world where Christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some.<br /><br />I gave it a 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original, for the most-part.

"The arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the Native American residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo... <br /><br />The commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones shooting bison...

"While being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the Gundam Wing series, upon re-watching the series, I have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam design, character design, and character depth are masterfully executed. While at first appearing like a boy band of sorts, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art, with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. While I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we obtain peace?) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits, which, to say the least, is excellent.",1,while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series  upon re watching the series  i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated  but the plot  the gundam design  character design  and character depth are masterfully executed  while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts  the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art  with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters  consequently  it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character  personally  i liked heero because of his stoic personality  while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood  i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general  how can we obtain peace   while providing action packed battles in large robot suits  which  to say the least  is excellent 
"To some, this Biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation... Others see it as a story of grace, restoration, and hope... It is actually both  Henry King illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin, and his upward climb of healing..<br /><br />'David and Bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity... Henry King handles the powerful story, taken from the Old Testament, with skill...<br /><br />David, 'the lion of Judah,' having stormed the walls of Rabgah, saves the life of one of his faithful warriors Uriah (Kieron Moore), and returns to Jerusalem... <br /><br />Back at his court, his first wife complains of neglect, and offends him for being a shepherd's son, distinguishing herself for being the daughter of King Saul...<br /><br />One evening, and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood, David's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath... She was beautiful and attractive... David could not take his eyes off her... He finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers... <br /><br />Sending for her, he discovers that she, too, is unhappy in her marriage... By this point, it's apparent that David's intentions shift from an interest in taking Bathsheba as a wife, to just plain taking Bathsheba... As usual, sin had its consequences, and David hadn't planned on that possibility...<br /><br />When a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine, David suspects that the Lord is punishing him and his people for his sin... But when Bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of Moses, David tries to cover up his sin... <br /><br />He sends word to Joab, the commander of his army, and ordered him to send to him Bathsheba's husband... David did something that was abominable in God's sight... He sends the man to the front line where he would be killed... <br /><br />The soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way, David marries his beloved Bathsheba in full regal splendor...<br /><br />God punishes the couple when Bathsheba's child dies soon after birth... Meanwhile, a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the Israelites - led by Nathan - blame the King for their plight... They storm the palace and demand that Bathsheba pays for her sin...<br /><br />Peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity.. <br /><br />Hayward as Bathsheba, is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery... The sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in Biblical film history, is badly mishandled, and the viewers eyes are led briefly to Hayward's face and shoulders...<br /><br />Raymond Massey appeared as Nathan the Prophet, sent by God to rebuke David after his adultery with Bathsheba; Gwyneth Verdon is Queen Michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to David's personality and kingship; ex-silent screen idol, Francis X. Bushman, had a brief part as King Saul... <br /><br />The best moments of the film were: The Ark en route to its permanent home when God breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object; the defining moment in David's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death; and for the film's climax, inserting it as a flashback, David remembering his fight with the giant Goliath... <br /><br />With superb color photography and a masterly music score, 'David and Bathsheba' won Oscar nominations in the following categories: Music Scoring, Art and Set Direction, Cinematography, Story and Screenplay, and Costume Design..",1,to some  this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation    others see it as a story of grace  restoration  and hope    it is actually both  henry king illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion  his downward spiral of sin  and his upward climb of healing   david and bathsheba is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity    henry king handles the powerful story  taken from the old testament  with skill    david  the lion of judah  having stormed the walls of rabgah  saves the life of one of his faithful warriors uriah  kieron moore   and returns to jerusalem     back at his court  his first wife complains of neglect  and offends him for being a shepherds son  distinguishing herself for being the daughter of king saul    one evening  and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood  davids eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath    she was beautiful and attractive    david could not take his eyes off her    he finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers     sending for her  he discovers that she  too  is unhappy in her marriage    by this point  its apparent that davids intentions shift from an interest in taking bathsheba as a wife  to just plain taking bathsheba    as usual  sin had its consequences  and david hadnt planned on that possibility    when a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine  david suspects that the lord is punishing him and his people for his sin    but when bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of moses  david tries to cover up his sin     he sends word to joab  the commander of his army  and ordered him to send to him bathshebas husband    david did something that was abominable in gods sight    he sends the man to the front line where he would be killed     the soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way  david marries his beloved bathsheba in full regal splendor    god punishes the couple when bathshebas child dies soon after birth    meanwhile  a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the israelites   led by nathan   blame the king for their plight    they storm the palace and demand that bathsheba pays for her sin    peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity    hayward as bathsheba  is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery    the sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in biblical film history  is badly mishandled  and the viewers eyes are led briefly to haywards face and shoulders    raymond massey appeared as nathan the prophet  sent by god to rebuke david after his adultery with bathsheba  gwyneth verdon is queen michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to davids personality and kingship  ex silent screen idol  francis x  bushman  had a brief part as king saul     the best moments of the film were  the ark en route to its permanent home when god breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object  the defining moment in davids life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death  and for the films climax  inserting it as a flashback  david remembering his fight with the giant goliath     with superb color photography and a masterly music score  david and bathsheba won oscar nominations in the following categories  music scoring  art and set direction  cinematography  story and screenplay  and costume design  
"This movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original. It's directed by Martin Kitrosser of Friday the 13th fame. The acting is very bad indeed, but the gore and special effects help make it interesting. Thats one thing I like about Screaming Mad George (make up effects artist for the film), his effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get. The movie isn't really all that gory, but there is an EXTREMELY nasty eyeball-munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot (what!?!) Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time, possibly? If you liked the weirdo 4th installment (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. I liked it better than the Matrix!

"After watching this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (This has passed over time). This film was utter garbage. First, they tried to recreate the ending from the first ""Howling,"" with incredibly bad make-up. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film! The plot sucks and the whole film is just AWFUL!!!! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (From the look of it, it was SUPPOSED to be Dee Wallace Stone)teams up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, lead by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time.<br /><br />This is not even worth renting (Unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity.).

"An absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage, Russian animation pioneer Wladyslaw Starewicz's ""Mest kinematograficheskogo operatora"" (""The Cameraman's Revenge"", or ""The Revenge of a Kinematograph Cameraman"") is a delight of early animation, brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. Beetle have a completely uneventful marriage, and both yearn for more excitement in their lives. Mr. Beetle's desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the ""Gay Dragonfly"" night club, whom he visits whenever he takes a ""business trip"" to the city. She is the only one who understands him. A fellow admirer of this dancer, an aggressive grasshopper, is jealous that Mr. Beetle has stolen his lady and, as fate would have it, he is also a movie cameraman. The devious grasshopper follows Mr. Beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room, where he films their exploits through the keyhole.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mrs. Beetle has, likewise, acquired a friend to add excitement to her life. He is an artist, and he brings her a painting for a present, before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy. At that moment, however, Mr. Beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle. As Mr. Beetle bashes through the front door, the artist friend clambers up the chimney, but he doesn't escape without Mr. Beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him.<br /><br />There is a certain irony in the statement that follows: ""Mr. Beetle is generous. He forgives his wife and takes her to a movie."" He is generous enough to forgive her, and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier. At this point in time, however, we still haven't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge, and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film Mr. and Mrs. Beetle are attending. Suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of Mr. Beetle's disloyalty, and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella, before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper.<br /><br />In the final scene, both Mr. and Mrs. Beetle, now somewhat more appreciative of each other, are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when Mr. Beetle sought his final revenge. We do, indeed, hope that ""the home life of the Beetles will be less exciting in the future"" This film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect species, but Starewicz is communicating so much more than that. This isn't a story about beetles  it is a story about us.

"The movie is just plain fun....maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of ""The Ramones"" around the time the film was made. I've watched the film over and over, by myself and with friends, and it is still fresh and funny. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless, and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless.<br /><br />And, the film has some gem lines/scenes.....references to how our ""permanent record"" in high school will follow us through life. (Let me assure you I've been out of high school for, uhhh, some years and it's not following me).....the famous ""static"" line (""I'm getting some static"".....""Not as much as you're going to get"", as Principal Togar approaches).....the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses....the Nazi Hall Monitors love for a ""body search"" ......Principal Togar announcing, ""I give you the final solution"", and burning the Ramones records (note: records were what came before CD's) ....and of course Joey Ramone noting, ""Things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school"", followed by Togar asking ""Do your parents know you're Ramones?""<br /><br />Just one piece of advice.....don't look up where the stars are now.....Joey Ramone sadly died young. Dey Young, who was a major hottie in the film, today reminds us we all age....PJ Soles career never advanced as we might have expected......... Marla Rosenfield, as one the other students, apparently appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film), though I submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles.

"""Cinema is the ultimate pervert art. It doesn't give you what you desire; it tells you how to desire.""<br /><br />So begins ""The Pervert's Guide to Cinema,"" in which Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek applies his Freudian/Lacanian brain-scalpel to world cinema. This film in three parts is the second feature documentary directed by Sophie Fiennes (yes, sister of Ralph and Joseph), and it is a notable accomplishment, clocking in at 2 1/2 hours of talk from one man and yet remaining humorous and engaging throughout. In essence, it is an extended film lecture, and one of the best you may ever get. Over the course of the film, Zizek guides us through a catalog of obsession and desire in film history. He touches on more than 40 films and, in particular, spends a great deal of time with Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin, Tarkovsky, the Marx Brothers, and Eisenstein. But he also takes a close look at ""Persona,"" ""The Conversation,"" ""Three Colors: Blue,"" ""Dogville,"" ""Fight Club,"" and ""The Exorcist."" Thematically, Zizek's inquiry into cinema ranges from thoughts on the death drive to the ""coordinates of desire,"" and from Gnosticism to ""partial objects.""<br /><br />""The Pervert's Guide"" will be a slightly better experience if you've taken a few minutes to bone up on your basic Freudian terminology. However, even if you're not steeped in psychoanalytic theory, Zizek's dynamic and hilarious personality carries the film forward with such gusto that you aren't likely to balk at the specialized lingo. The film frequently cuts from movie clips to images of Zizek *inside* the movie he is talking about--that is, in the original locations and sets. The transitions in these sequences sustain such tension and humor that the trick never gets old. And Zizek himself is constantly making us laugh, either from bizarre little jokes or from his enthusiastic insistence on, for example, a bold Oedipal interpretation of ""The Birds."" And this go-ahead-and-laugh attitude, on the parts of both Fiennes and Zizek, is essential to the gonzo character of the film. It is the spoonful of sugar that helps us digest Zizek's weird medicine. After all, don't we all have a sense that, past a certain point, psychology theorists are just pulling our legs?",1, cinema is the ultimate pervert art  it doesnt give you what you desire  it tells you how to desire   so begins  the perverts guide to cinema   in which slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst slavoj zizek applies his freudian lacanian brain scalpel to world cinema  this film in three parts is the second feature documentary directed by sophie fiennes  yes  sister of ralph and joseph   and it is a notable accomplishment  clocking in at 2 1 2 hours of talk from one man and yet remaining humorous and engaging throughout  in essence  it is an extended film lecture  and one of the best you may ever get  over the course of the film  zizek guides us through a catalog of obsession and desire in film history  he touches on more than 40 films and  in particular  spends a great deal of time with hitchcock  lynch  chaplin  tarkovsky  the marx brothers  and eisenstein  but he also takes a close look at  persona    the conversation    three colors  blue    dogville    fight club   and  the exorcist   thematically  zizeks inquiry into cinema ranges from thoughts on the death drive to the  coordinates of desire   and from gnosticism to  partial objects    the perverts guide  will be a slightly better experience if youve taken a few minutes to bone up on your basic freudian terminology  however  even if youre not steeped in psychoanalytic theory  zizeks dynamic and hilarious personality carries the film forward with such gusto that you arent likely to balk at the specialized lingo  the film frequently cuts from movie clips to images of zizek  inside  the movie he is talking about  that is  in the original locations and sets  the transitions in these sequences sustain such tension and humor that the trick never gets old  and zizek himself is constantly making us laugh  either from bizarre little jokes or from his enthusiastic insistence on  for example  a bold oedipal interpretation of  the birds   and this go ahead and laugh attitude  on the parts of both fiennes and zizek  is essential to the gonzo character of the film  it is the spoonful of sugar that helps us digest zizeks weird medicine  after all  dont we all have a sense that  past a certain point  psychology theorists are just pulling our legs

So you see it will be an entertainment to all ages. You just have to give it a chance. And it teaches a lesson too, just be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly alike.

"An unmarried, twenty-something hick (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in a Texas honky-tonk. At face value, it's a modern love story ... Texas style. There's gobs of cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs, and references to big belt-buckles and rodeos. The music, if not Texas native, is Texas adapted, courtesy of the talents of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee, and the Charlie Daniels Band. And that Texas twang ... ""y'all"".<br /><br />The story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of Texas five-alarm chili made with Jalapeno peppers. It's enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a genteel classic, one starring Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman, maybe. ""Hamlet"" it's not. But ""Urban Cowboy"" is spicy and explicit, and I kinda like it.<br /><br />Technically, the film is generally good. The dialogue, the production design, and the costumes are all realistic; the editing is skillful. And both the casting and the acting are commendable, if not Oscar worthy. I would not have cast Travolta in the role he plays, but he does a fine job ... ditto Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, are good too, in support roles. But, the cinematography seemed weak. The film copy I watched was grainy, and at times suffered from a reddish/orange tint, a visual trait I have noticed in other films from the same time period.<br /><br />At first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political ""message"". But I would argue that when ""Urban Cowboy"" was released twenty-five years ago, it had rather prophetic implications. In 1980 the U.S. had all kinds of problems, not the least being American hostages held by Iran. In the minds of a lot of folks back then, the U.S. was being pushed around, bullied.<br /><br />This film, along with others of its time, offered something that Americans wanted to see in their political leaders ... toughness. ""Urban Cowboy"" is a very physical film. The characters in it may not be the brightest people on Earth. But, they're tough!<br /><br />Everything about ""Urban Cowboy"" is anti-intellectual. As a vehicle for cultural expression then, this 1980 film was one of several that augured a new get-tough era for the U.S. It started in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And that era continues to this day, with a President who probably will not be remembered for his intellect, but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression, traits that Americans seem to gravitate to as surely as Texans to five-alarm chili.",1,an unmarried  twenty something hick  played by john travolta  leaves the farm and goes to houston  where he learns about life and love in a texas honky tonk  at face value  its a modern love story     texas style  theres gobs of cowboy hats  pickup trucks  neon beer signs  and references to big belt buckles and rodeos  the music  if not texas native  is texas adapted  courtesy of the talents of mickey gilley  johnny lee  and the charlie daniels band  and that texas twang      yall   the story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of texas five alarm chili made with jalapeno peppers  its enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a genteel classic  one starring laurence olivier or ingrid bergman  maybe   hamlet  its not  but  urban cowboy  is spicy and explicit  and i kinda like it  technically  the film is generally good  the dialogue  the production design  and the costumes are all realistic  the editing is skillful  and both the casting and the acting are commendable  if not oscar worthy  i would not have cast travolta in the role he plays  but he does a fine job     ditto debra winger  barry corbin and brooke alderson  among others  are good too  in support roles  but  the cinematography seemed weak  the film copy i watched was grainy  and at times suffered from a reddish orange tint  a visual trait i have noticed in other films from the same time period  at first glance  the film does not seem to offer any social or political  message   but i would argue that when  urban cowboy  was released twenty five years ago  it had rather prophetic implications  in 1980 the u s  had all kinds of problems  not the least being american hostages held by iran  in the minds of a lot of folks back then  the u s  was being pushed around  bullied  this film  along with others of its time  offered something that americans wanted to see in their political leaders     toughness   urban cowboy  is a very physical film  the characters in it may not be the brightest people on earth  but  theyre tough  everything about  urban cowboy  is anti intellectual  as a vehicle for cultural expression then  this 1980 film was one of several that augured a new get tough era for the u s  it started in 1980 with the election of reagan  and that era continues to this day  with a president who probably will not be remembered for his intellect  but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression  traits that americans seem to gravitate to as surely as texans to five alarm chili

"All you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period, and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. Once you get that message, you may as well switch to another film.<br /><br />Davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world--instead of living a fantasy film of which he's the imagined director--he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he's idealized beyond reason. A couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.<br /><br />The film is also interesting as documentation of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying brattiness was something to be overcome, but here it's his character's only quality. Schwartzman's family connection clearly landed him in this role; here's hoping his choices improve.",0,all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes  it looks cool  it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late 60s period  and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable  once you get that message  you may as well switch to another film  daviess protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend  one of the few people in his life who cares about him  then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world  instead of living a fantasy film of which hes the imagined director  he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress hes idealized beyond reason  a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here  the film is also interesting as documentation of jason schwartzmans fall from mount rushmore  in rushmore  schwartzmans annoying brattiness was something to be overcome  but here its his characters only quality  schwartzmans family connection clearly landed him in this role  heres hoping his choices improve 
"I figured that it's about time I let this one out. Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. Why? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television. So what is their problem when it comes to the movies? Honestly now, I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies. They are all enjoyable and fun to watch. And, after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters, I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts. The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says `Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap.<br /><br />*possible spoilers from here on*<br /><br />Well, I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. My first gripe with this came with no narration. I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together. This wouldn't have been a problem, except for one thing. Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end? Possibly the fans, but I'm sure not the parents. Then, there's the theme song. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one. The Japanese theme song was `Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children. It was fun and enjoyable. This one: nauseating. Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana. Nice music, fun to watch. That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pokémon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary. Oh, and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath. You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But, I haven't touched on the worst of it yet.<br /><br />You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power. For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were `well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.' That in mind, I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, `You will believe that one person can make all the difference.' With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version. Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words `the main feature 'The Power of One.' At that point, I became a bit more uneasy. `The Power of One?!' Not a good sign. However, I still kept some of my false faith. Big mistake.<br /><br />Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB. However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie. First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read `the world turns to Ash.' Ah hah. So, Ash is the chosen one? Whatever. In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time, he's the chosen one. A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia. Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia. In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash. In the scene where they're flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference. Overall in this category, Ash wasn't really the `one person' that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way.<br /><br />A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one. Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection `started with a Mew card?' Ugh. Even worse, Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held. `Why didn't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them? This is like caging them to be displayed.' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket. Some pretty funny lines. Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well, that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well. Forget you, Kids WB and 4Kids. You have forsaken me for the last time.",0,i figured that its about time i let this one out  pokémon fans are suffering in america these days  why  because we rely on kids wb and 4kids entertainment

"Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture into this genre. A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, ""Schindler's List"".<br /><br />Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. ""The Color Purple"" is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.<br /><br />Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover lends solid support, though his ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart"". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong.<br /><br />Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery.<br /><br />This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video",1,genteel  softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre  a departure from his normal adventure fantasy fare  it paved the way for his 1993 success   schindlers list   based upon alice walders pulitzer prize winning novel  the story concerns a young girls arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal  angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie  while the plot   about compassion  abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds   is often powerful and moving  it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes scrambling screenplay   the color purple  is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame  this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walkers novel  a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems  as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director  performances are strong throughout  with whoopi goldberg making a debut   which shes never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment   as the heart broken celie who just yearns to be loved  danny glover lends solid support  though his  moses  was a superior turn for him in  places in the heart   the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia  the single minded  fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising  upper class white woman  good support also from margaret avery  adolph caesar and rae dawn chong  quincy jones   co producer with spielberg  kathleen kennedy and frank marshall   has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion  editing from michael kahn is sound as always  while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenery  this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye  it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions  wednesday  january 15  1997   video
"George P. Cosmatos' ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is pure wish-fulfillment. The United States clearly didn't win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. ""We Were Soldiers"") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them. ""Do we get to win this time?"" Yes, you do.",0,george p  cosmatos  rambo  first blood part ii  is pure wish fulfillment  the united states clearly didnt win the war in vietnam  they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh so innocent soldiers  the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation  who made this war happen  the character of rambo is perfect to notice this  he is extremely patriotic  bemoans that us americans didnt appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier  but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians  like every film that defends the war  e g   we were soldiers   also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia  and for that matter also the reason for every single us american soldier that was there  instead  rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation  it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories  rather than suppressing them   do we get to win this time   yes  you do

"This movie's one of my favorites. It's not really any good, but it's great to laugh at. The dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted (eg, ""Manji, can we ask you a few questions?""

"great mystery, but the film goes down hill from there. The beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman. They don't like outsiders. A lot of filler is with Ed shown looking around town for the girl. That made the movie too long. It finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for Edward.<br /><br />Overall, not a well written story and too long. <br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this.",0,great mystery  but the film goes down hill from there  the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer  edward  he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills  a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter  so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman  they dont like outsiders  a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl  that made the movie too long  it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward  overall  not a well written story and too long   final verdict  i would skip this 
"Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns. He was a great actor, From Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden arm are a proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, specially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. In a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. Also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it? I think that this film should not have been withdrawn, because any film with Sinatra is worth seeing, and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable",0,frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns  he was a great actor  from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that  but he did not have the physique of a western hero  you identified him as an urban guy  but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho  the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault  i blame it on two factors  a  the story was too unusual  specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie  in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern  to break away from it the film has to be very good  b  the story is not convincing  it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother  also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible  why all the gunfighters have not adopted it  i think that this film should not have been withdrawn  because any film with sinatra is worth seeing  and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
"...which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall, ""DinoCroc"" was a much better movie. Sure, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in ""DinoCroc"" were better, the plot lines were better, and the acting was better. Here are the problems with ""Blood Surf"" -- 1) the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island, in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there's not enough croc time. There are a couple of redeeming qualities of ""Blood Surf"" -- the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie. But if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi/killer crocodile movie, skip this one and fire up ""DinoCroc"" instead.",0,   which isnt exactly a ringing endorsement  overall   dinocroc  was a much better movie  sure  in that movie matt borlenghi played a complete wuss bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the dinocroc  but the special effects in  dinocroc  were better  the plot lines were better  and the acting was better  here are the problems with  blood surf     1  the killer crocodile looks like a kids model with a retractable jaw  2  the plot is ridiculous  matt borlenghi   co  get shipwrecked on a deserted island  in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group  which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film  and 3  theres not enough croc time  there are a couple of redeeming qualities of  blood surf     the actresses are pretty attractive and matt borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie  but if youre on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one matt borlenghi killer crocodile movie  skip this one and fire up  dinocroc  instead 
"Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple. The film is full of creepy visuals, and scares' that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat. The staircase scene in particular, these guys are good. Although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good, and the actors come through. Dark Remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some, but I guess it makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives', however some side characters like the Sheriff didn't convince me. They aren't all that important anyways.

"The British horror film was in terminal decline by the start of the Seventies, but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best our island produced. The Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House That Dripped Blood made the future seem rosy, even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasn't going to be one. THTDB has the sort of cast that could easily form a wishlist, if it hadn't actually been assembled, in the bleak hinterland of 2008 you may well find yourself expecting to wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is, naturally, my favourite, Cushing's life and art are interlinked so firmly that you can't tell where performance ends and pain begins. One can only guess how this role affected such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and the maiden.

A very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on Guadalcanal and must come home and re-adjust himself with the help of family and friends. An excellent cast of actor's helps make this movie very entertaining. Eleanor Parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such an innocence to her in this movie. Ann Doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles. I especially like the hometown aura of pre-war Phildelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course the war scene on Guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle. A well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten,1,a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re adjust himself with the help of family and friends  an excellent cast of actors helps make this movie very entertaining  eleanor parkers role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination  she has such an innocence to her in this movie  ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles  i especially like the hometown aura of pre war phildelphia  the hunting scene is very good  of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle  a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten
"I remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. Wasn't necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name, the fact that there is a bet, and a whole lot of worm eating. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent. How the kids know each other, the number of kids involved, how the bet came about, the number of worms that must be eaten, the time frame in which he has to eat the worms, how they are cooked, progression of friendships, climax scenes, etc., NOTHING is the same. But somehow, it did not ruin the movie for me. The characters are all enjoyable, and the film did not leave me disappointed. Word of caution for parents, there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a ""dilly dick"". The embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us, ""Does anybody know what a dilly dick is?"" lol. That and an occasional ""shut up"" is as foul mouthed as this film gets. My daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty nacho container just in case) but was fine by worm 6. She and I both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience.",1,i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now  i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day  we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare  wasnt necessary  the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters first name  the fact that there is a bet  and a whole lot of worm eating  oh yeah  i almost forgot  the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent  how the kids know each other  the number of kids involved  how the bet came about  the number of worms that must be eaten  the time frame in which he has to eat the worms  how they are cooked  progression of friendships  climax scenes  etc   nothing is the same  but somehow  it did not ruin the movie for me  the characters are all enjoyable  and the film did not leave me disappointed  word of caution for parents  there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billys little brother referred to his penis as a  dilly dick   the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us   does anybody know what a dilly dick is   lol  that and an occasional  shut up  is as foul mouthed as this film gets  my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4  and was holding the empty nacho container just in case  but was fine by worm 6  she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience 
"The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, part of Mengele's experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. The movie obviously had great reviews. It's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about.<br /><br />I too, for a large part of the movie, got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on. One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. ""In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center, the meaning of the word ""forgive"" is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own"" But by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more. After the ""strong-willed"" Eva Kor forgives her ""Nazi captors"" the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of Kor. The movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory. To me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her ""act of forgiveness"". Obviously, it was a very sick cow.<br /><br />On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the ""promised land"" to meet with some Arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis, including one at a Jewish center in Chicago. From then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.<br /><br />Firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was. A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan (Professor of education at Bethlehem University) gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.<br /><br />Finally, the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago, where she is ""grilled"" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.<br /><br />I will cut to the chase. By the end of the movie, I was hoping I hadn't chosen to watch the movie. The movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears. It showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion. Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.<br /><br />Lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? Quoting another IMDb user, ""I don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go."" That would be the perfect layman's definition of MAKING PEACE.<br /><br />I guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have ""gone through more than the human mind can fathom"".<br /><br />P.S.

"I got to see this on the plane to NZ last week, and was wondering how it would measure up to both the UK film and the book. I have to say I was favorable impressed. If anything the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, who have had success through the years. As a Brit I was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on. One question springs to mind - Was the screenplay written using the Sox as the team even before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan myself (weird I know, a Brit who understands baseball) I have to say that it added to the enjoyment.",1,i got to see this on the plane to nz last week  and was wondering how it would measure up to both the uk film and the book  i have to say i was favorable impressed  if anything the fanatical attachment to the red sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to arsenal fc  who have had success through the years  as a brit i was also interested to see that you dont need to understand baseball to get whats going on  one question springs to mind   was the screenplay written using the sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the bambino  or was another team in the frame  as a red sox fan myself  weird i know  a brit who understands baseball  i have to say that it added to the enjoyment 
"It's terrible how some people can get away with such things... This is one of those overrated things again... And I hate things that are overrated that are no good... Why can't we have more TV Shows and Movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something?? It takes many people to make this movie, the series, and the band, all possible, and those people are all wasting their time... It seems that the bands are getting younger and younger...

"This movie was seriously awful. The acting was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought to myself, well it's an old movie. Then I remembered that that is no excuse! I've seen older movies with way better acting and such.<br /><br />The music was terrible to. It was really choppy. The editing was poor (most of the dialog was out of sync.)<br /><br />Overall, this movie doesn't even deserve a 1. I only watched it because I was so bored, and the movie hardly entertained me. It was just laughable.

When she talks about her mother! WOW!<br /><br />Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was Oscar-worthy.

"I don't have much to add to my summary, this film ranks right up the there with Top Gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be. I for one don't think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable.<br /><br />I don't think it brings Christopher Walken's reputation down either as his reputation was on the wane back then anyway. It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in. As for Michael Ironside, he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget this movie had. The scenes and actors and explosions etc. are quite amazing so obviously someone liked it quite a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money.

"The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk's performance. The story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, free-spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underrated performance). She raises her daughter Jenny played so sweetly by Trini Alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life-altering decision. Through out the film, there are plenty of laughs, tears and memorable moments mostly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-stars as Jenny's would-be stepmother, who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you'll enjoy Bette Midler's version of STELLA.",1,the original with barbara stanwyk is saved only by stanwyks performance  the story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today  bette midlers version is much more interesting  she is stella claire  an independent  free spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend  stephen collins  or her friend  john goodman in an underrated performance   she raises her daughter jenny played so sweetly by trini alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that jennys father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life altering decision  through out the film  there are plenty of laughs  tears and memorable moments mostly between midler and alvarado  marsha mason co stars as jennys would be stepmother  who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her  if you like midler  goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion youll enjoy bette midlers version of stella 
"I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies. I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment. It was classic. Ahh yes. The dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops! It has it all. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common for this era of movie. Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days.

"At a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen, ""Apart From That"" is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest, fresh and innovative in there presentation than I have ever seen before. The usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film, leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen. While watching the movie, and even upon post contemplation, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that, performances. Every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives. Even so, ""Apart From That"" does not feel like a documentary or reality television, but instead transcends into a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. I look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker.<br /><br />This movie must be seen.",1,at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen   apart from that  is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest  fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before  the usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film  leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen  while watching the movie  and even upon post contemplation  it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that  performances  every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives  even so   apart from that  does not feel like a documentary or reality television  but instead transcends into a category of its own  with its unique cinematography and direction  i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer shainin and randy walker  this movie must be seen

"All right I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquers the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch was going to do next. Would Merlin help Santa Claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day?

"First of all I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best batman series by far. We watched it when it used to be on TV. I didn't realize that there was a season four. Actually there wasn't. BTAS ends with season 3, and it should have stopped there.<br /><br />Why did they have to mess with a good thing. Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible grey faces. The Joker looks beyond scary, it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier. He doesn't seem to have pupils anymore, and now he doesn't even look remotely human (although he is).<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who does the best batman. Although he now looks like superman. There is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes.<br /><br />Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred just has pupils from eyes, looks more like a character from the 80's.<br /><br />I have watched three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and I already find that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood in every episode).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Batman: The animated series, there is no batman season 4. They just included this series as season 4 for marketability. If they just released it as The New batman adventures I don't think as many people would have bought it.<br /><br />Save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3.",0,first of all i must admit batman  the animated series is the best batman series by far  we watched it when it used to be on tv  i didnt realize that there was a season four  actually there wasnt  btas ends with season 3  and it should have stopped there  why did they have to mess with a good thing  catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible grey faces  the joker looks beyond scary  it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier  he doesnt seem to have pupils anymore  and now he doesnt even look remotely human  although he is   bruce wayne is voiced by kevin conroy who does the best batman  although he now looks like superman  there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same  bruce wayne now has blue eyes  night wing really needs a haircut  please  alfred just has pupils from eyes  looks more like a character from the 80s  i have watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic  there is blood in every episode   if you are a fan of batman  the animated series  there is no batman season 4  they just included this series as season 4 for marketability  if they just released it as the new batman adventures i dont think as many people would have bought it  save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1 3 
"Some of the background details of this story are based, very, very loosely, on real events of the era in which this was placed. The story combines some of the details of the famous Leopold and Loeb case along with a bit of Aimee Semple McPherson.<br /><br />The story begins with two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) being hounded as they leave a courtroom. The crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime. One person in the crowd apparently slashes Winters' hand as they make their way to a waiting car.<br /><br />Soon after they arrive home, they begin getting threatening phone calls, so Reynolds suggests they both move to the West Coast together and open a dance school. The dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with Reynolds and they begin dating. Life appears very good. But, when the threatening phone calls begin again, Winters responds by flipping out--behaving like she's nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion--listening on the radio to 'Sister Alma' almost constantly. Again and again, you see Winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things!! I won't say more, as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film.<br /><br />In many ways, this film is a lot like the Bette Davis and Joan Crawford horror films of the 1960s like ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", ""Straight-Jacket"" and ""The Nanny"". While none of these are exactly intellectual fare, on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun. The writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting. Winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year-olds I've ever seen--plus she can really, really dance.<br /><br />My only concern about all this is that some might find Winters' hyper-religiosity in the film a bit tacky--like a cheap attack on Christianity. At first I felt that way, but when you meet Sister Alma, she seems sincere and is not mocked, so I took Winters' religious zeal as just a sign of craziness--which, I assume, is all that was intended.<br /><br />By the way, this film is packaged along with ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?""--another Shelley Winters horror film from 1971.

"Enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially, William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), ""Mister Roberts"", who played the role as a doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), ""Shane"", and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 Comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a California Race Track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) ""King Kong"" gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with James Gleason, a detective who need the help of Dr. Bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery.

"When Rodney Dangerfield is on a roll, he's hilarious. In My 5 Wives, he's not on a roll. The timing of the one-liners is off, but they're the best thing going for the movie. The five women who play the wives don't add up to one whole actress between them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is pretty weak; there are a few jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the movie could play the same way even if Rodney's character had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an old man's fantasy than a key part of the comedy. Another old man's fantasy: we're supposed to accept that Rodney's character is an athletic skier.<br /><br />Jerry Stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor, and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work.<br /><br />The odd nods to political correctness later in the movie don't really do anything for the movie. For those who like their movies politically correct, the non-PC humor is still there in the first place, and the seeming apologies for it still don't get the point. For those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness, the PC add-ins are just annoying digressions.<br /><br />This has to be the mildest R-rated movie I've ever seen. There are some racy jokes, and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking TV 40 years ago, but that's about it. Maybe it was the topless men (kidding).<br /><br />The DVD features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles. I kept wondering if they were serious or kidding. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, ""They must be kidding!"" There's also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the Mormons or the Church of Latter-Day Saints, that somehow it's not about them. Never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in Utah, and makes reference to Brigham Young.<br /><br />In short, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping for Rodney on a roll, but the best I can say for the movie is that Rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time.",0,when rodney dangerfield is on a roll  hes hilarious  in my 5 wives  hes not on a roll  the timing of the one liners is off  but theyre the best thing going for the movie  the five women who play the wives dont add up to one whole actress between them  the plot is very weak  even the premise is pretty weak  there are a few jokes about having multiple wives  but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie  most of the movie could play the same way even if rodneys character had only one wife  so the premise seems more like an old mans fantasy than a key part of the comedy  another old mans fantasy  were supposed to accept that rodneys character is an athletic skier  jerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor  and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work  the odd nods to political correctness later in the movie dont really do anything for the movie  for those who like their movies politically correct  the non pc humor is still there in the first place  and the seeming apologies for it still dont get the point  for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness  the pc add ins are just annoying digressions  this has to be the mildest r rated movie ive ever seen  there are some racy jokes  and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago  but thats about it  maybe it was the topless men  kidding   the dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles  i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding  they seem to be serious  but i kept thinking   they must be kidding   theres also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latter day saints  that somehow its not about them  never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in utah  and makes reference to brigham young  in short  my 5 wives was a disappointment  i was hoping for rodney on a roll  but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time 
"""Wild Tigers I have Known."" It will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. It is one of those films SO artsy, that it makes no sense what so ever, except to the director! I HATE those!

"Emilio Miraglia's first Giallo feature, The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, was a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror - and this second film is even better! We've got more of the Giallo side of the equation this time around, although Miraglia doesn't lose the Gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight. Miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around, and as a result it's the typical Giallo labyrinth, with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes. This is a definite bonus for the film, however, as while it can get a little too confusing at times; there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and Miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie. The plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. The legend revolves around a woman called 'The Red Queen' who, legend has it, returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people. A few years later, murders begin to occur...<br /><br />Even though he only made two Giallo's, Miraglia does have his own set of tributes. It's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called 'Evelyn'. He likes castles, Gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! Miraglia may be no Argento when it comes to spilling blood, but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film; and here we have delights involving a Volkswagen Beetle, and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite Giallo death scenes. The female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off! The score courtesy of Bruno Nicolai is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave; it fits the film well. The ending is something of a turn-off, as although Miraglia revs up the Gothic atmosphere, it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious. But even so, this is a delightfully entertaining Giallo and one that I highly recommend to fans of the genre!",1,emilio miraglias first giallo feature  the night evelyn came out of the grave  was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror   and this second film is even better  weve got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around  although miraglia doesnt lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight  miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around  and as a result its the typical giallo labyrinth  with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes  this is a definite bonus for the film  however  as while it can get a little too confusing at times  theres always enough to hold the audiences interest and miraglias storytelling has improved since his earlier movie  the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting  before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle  the legend revolves around a woman called the red queen who  legend has it  returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people  a few years later  murders begin to occur    even though he only made two giallos  miraglia does have his own set of tributes  its obvious that the colour red is important to him  as it features heavily in both films  and he appears to have something against women called evelyn  he likes castles  gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too   which is fine by me  miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood  but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film  and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle  and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes  the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eye pleasing cast of ladies that arent afraid to take their clothes off  the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy  and even though it doesnt feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave  it fits the film well  the ending is something of a turn off  as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere  it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious  but even so  this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre 
"Dull, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance (Weller) who goes on across the country just to find his ex-wife and children; meanwhile, he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands.

"The costumes and make-up were grand, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing. Sure this was mostly a movie for kids, but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of Dr Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It's worth a see, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic, by any measure.",1,the costumes and make up were grand  there were some exceptionally funny lines  and the role was made for jim carrey  carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing  sure this was mostly a movie for kids  but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of dr seuss  i expected more from ron howard  its worth a see  but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic  by any measure 
"This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while.<br /><br />Wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie: it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway, but as it happens, it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa, and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is.<br /><br />So what is it then? Well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it's intended as a horror flick -- ""intended"" very much being the key word here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess, the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic, and as for the acting, well, let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school, my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent.<br /><br />Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations, certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned. Also, even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting.<br /><br />But still.<br /><br />B-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding, such as humour. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humour in that--and I could for the first 20 minutes or so, gradually dozing off after that--then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts.<br /><br />Woohoo, how exciting.<br /><br />As for the story, it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything: the victims either use drugs and/or are involved in serious crime. The lesson: Watch out, naughty boys and girls, because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done.<br /><br />I rest my case.<br /><br />So, all in all, a little bit of sex, a fair amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll.<br /><br />I rate this one 1 out of 10, but would go to 0 if I could. Or perhaps I wouldn't: it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles.

"A Movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers, who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters, I thought this might be my kind of movie... it wasn't!!! This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it! It has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes after the main characters *rolling*, the feet are obviously waving in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors, the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile, it would be at least worth a laugh, but it gets worse: I'd guess, the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was, so they though up the old idea of ""sex sells""... Totally, i mean TOTALLY without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast. And somewhere towards the beginning there's some kind of meaningless ""makeout"". This is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me. It's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish!

"Once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results. The title is false as is everything about this film. The period is not persuasively rendered, and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version strayed from the facts, presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting, and innovative for 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care. This 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow, unappealing, and not the least bit interesting. By all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better.

"When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny. Well I was wrong. Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.<br /><br />Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.",0,when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb  but it will at least be funny  well i was wrong  even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re evaluating their life  the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible  the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny  but by the end  i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next  throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre  which is still more than i can say for the movie itself 
"I didn't know this was a silent movie with narration. I don't care for silent movies - the corny humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. I'm sure that attributes to the low score I assigned it. It was about chapter 8 before I found any interest in this story and had I had popcorn I may have thrown it at the screen. Maybe this appeals to the sci-fi crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater. Isabella Rosselinni narrated this movie - the one enjoyable aspect of the movie. No one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story.

"I just watched Holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called Trade at Film by the Sea international film festival. I have to say that Holly blew Trade out of the water. <br /><br />Holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels. From purely an artistic and cinematic perspective, it is amazing. The sound-mixing, camera angles, directing and acting are all spot on. <br /><br />Additionally, the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non-exploitative. It presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate. The filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail, truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. Too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape, and violence. Holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical Hollywood trend. <br /><br />I've had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen audiences more moved. Just listening to conversations after the screening, people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation. <br /><br />I highly recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and its subject matter.",1,i just watched holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called trade at film by the sea international film festival  i have to say that holly blew trade out of the water   holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels  from purely an artistic and cinematic perspective  it is amazing  the sound mixing  camera angles  directing and acting are all spot on   additionally  the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non exploitative  it presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate  the filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail  truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking  too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind  it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape  and violence  holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical hollywood trend   ive had the pleasure of seeing holly at two separate film festivals  once in the us and once in netherlands  i can honestly say that i have never seen audiences more moved  just listening to conversations after the screening  people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation   i highly recommend it to everyone  both for its cinematic value and its subject matter 
"Filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves.<br /><br />This film is set in Glasgow (although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a Scottish accent). The premise, about people who's lives are going nowhere, who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs, COULD have made for a really funny, insightful, quirky, cultish film.

"The over-heated plot of ""Bonjour tristesse"" is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a best-seller, though God knows why. For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. Don't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. Unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg. She's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan -- Seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. This movie, also by Preminger, fulfills the ""promise"" of the first. It was her second movie; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? Not a chance? Seberg's character is at the center of the story and, pretty though she is, convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old, she can't meet the emotional demands of the role. I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures. But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check. In spite of Niven and Kerr, this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons.",0,the over heated plot of  bonjour tristesse  is taken from a juvenile first novel by francoise sagan  which became a best seller  though god knows why  for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step parent it may have a certain appeal  dont be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step mother in  prospect  unfortunately  too much rests on the frail shoulders of jean seberg  shes beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager  the problem is that she can strike poses but she cant act  anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto premingers st  joan    sebergs first film    knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film  this movie  also by preminger  fulfills the  promise  of the first  it was her second movie  she was now 20  what was preminger thinking  that niven and kerr could compensate for sebergs lack of acting capacity  not a chance  sebergs character is at the center of the story and  pretty though she is  convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old  she cant meet the emotional demands of the role  i dont know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures  but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check  in spite of niven and kerr  this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons 
"I've seen about four other Japanese horror films and they weren't too impressive. However, I could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way.<br /><br />Not here, no way. This is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening. When he finds a suspect to question, the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost. Then, the ghost starts to follow the detective around FOR A REASON THAT IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND TAKES UP MORE THAN HALF OF THE MOVIE.<br /><br />Bad enough? Oh no. The film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don't have much to do with the story. I've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective. Not the case here.<br /><br />Also, whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends. For example, there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and...then it just cuts to another scene. I'm aware that this can be a dramatic effect. That's definitely not the intention here. It's just bad editing.<br /><br />Finally, there's the ""ghost"" who just screams in a way that's not scary or unintentionally funny. It's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie.<br /><br />All of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming. Then after one of them, the movie is over.

"Not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie, (I one of them) the stooges just aren't given any material to work with. It is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with Curly, and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny, when it could have had great potential. Awful musical numbers don't help any either.

"This is a low-budget spoof of the espionage genre. To help frame your expectations, you should know that: (1) The acting is wildly heavy-handed. The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and off-key pacing. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements. (3) Shots are frequently framed in off-balance angles, poking fun at genre excesses. (4) A pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner.<br /><br />The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the B-films of the 1930's: a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by Carl Sagan. The film's over-the-top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early running gag, Fay Grim's son Ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad. Parker Posey's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film.<br /><br />The film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge. The film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy. Moreover, it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is intentionally heavy handed, and I found this (and the off-kilter camera angles) more irritating than humorous.<br /><br />The over-the-top acting, the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies/counter conspiracies, and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers. The movie is much too long at 158 minutes.<br /><br />That said, fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again ... using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy-handed than light-hearted. But, the comedy may well appeal to your tastes. The film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films, fans of director Hal Harley, or devotees of Parker Posey (who has the most camera time).",0,this is a low budget spoof of the espionage genre  to help frame your expectations  you should know that   1  the acting is wildly heavy handed  the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement  frequent hand gestures  and off key pacing   2  the script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility  oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements   3  shots are frequently framed in off balance angles  poking fun at genre excesses   4  a pop eyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner  the film has a guiding intelligence  deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the b films of the 1930s  a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl sagan  the films over the top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes  in an early running gag  fay grims son ned is so frequently told to leave that you cant help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad  parker poseys nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film  the films slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge  the films impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy  moreover  it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic  the musical score is intentionally heavy handed  and i found this  and the off kilter camera angles  more irritating than humorous  the over the top acting  the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies counter conspiracies  and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers  the movie is much too long at 158 minutes  that said  fans who are receptive to the films sarcasm might want to watch again     using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog  the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy handed than light hearted  but  the comedy may well appeal to your tastes  the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films  fans of director hal harley  or devotees of parker posey  who has the most camera time  
"Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who go on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage. In this way, the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, such as ""Return to Paradise"", but instead, the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship.<br /><br />Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both turn in excellent performances, and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. This movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life (which is a bit glossed over), and focuses more on these friendship issues.<br /><br />There were some plot holes here, and some parts that just didn't seem believable or realistic. We didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have. And we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls, with Bill Pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. In short, this should, by all rights, have been a much darker movie than it was.<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting.

"More wide-eyed, hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti-social, pathological behaviour. Danza and Grayson will leave you begging for mercy.<br /><br />It's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead (or in nursing homes). I kinda thought about suing them for torture. As this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor, defenseless ear-drums, I felt instant, strong pain envelop my entire being. That damn muscular vibrato can shatter Soviet tanks into tiny bits, nevermind glass.<br /><br />""Why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it?"", you might ask angrily. Fair point, fair point... The answer is that I wanted to, but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that I fell to the floor, writhing in agony. With my last ounces of energy, I tried to reach the remote but couldn't.<br /><br />A silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven, who then proceeds to ""pigmalionize"" him. Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson, but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up. This may seem like a rather thin plot, but this noisy movie is so chock-full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all. This movie is RELENTLESS. Forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with Slayer's ""Reign In Blood"" (as in a South Park episode). Whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world, it's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year-olds impersonating grown-ups. I can only envy people who find movies like this funny. It must be great being easy-to-please: what a world of wonder would open up to me if only I could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious, gut-busting comedy. <br /><br />But let's examine this phenomenon, the 50s musical. My best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day-dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into Utopia or Heaven (depending on whether you're church-going or Lenin's-tomb-going), or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy-inspired places. TTONO is more akin to a representation of Hell, but that's just me. I don't seem to ""get"" musicals. People talk, there is a story - but then all-of-a-sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened! When you think about it, musicals are stranger than any science-fiction film.<br /><br />Worse yet, TTONO (my favourite type of pizza, btw) is not just a 50s musical, but one with opera squealing. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as over-training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear-piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure. The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet. I tried lowering the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I ended up lowering it to a 1, which is usually so low that it's only heard by specially-trained dogs and certain types of marsupials, and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys!<br /><br />Take the scene in the small boat in the river. Danza starts off with one of his deafening, brain-killing tunes, and then... nothing. No animals anywhere to be seen. Even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have all but left. If you look carefully, you might even see the trees change colour, from green to yellow, in a matter of minutes. No, this was not a continuity error, it was plain old torture of the flora. And those trees were just matte paintings! Imagine how real trees would have reacted.<br /><br />The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency, but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self-explosion. I can listen to the loudest, least friendly death metal band for hours, but give me just a minute of a soprano and I get a splitting headache.",0,more wide eyed  hysterical 50s hyper cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti social  pathological behaviour  danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy  its a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead  or in nursing homes   i kinda thought about suing them for torture  as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor  defenseless ear drums  i felt instant  strong pain envelop my entire being  that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits  nevermind glass   why didnt you switch the channel if you didnt like it    you might ask angrily  fair point  fair point    the answer is that i wanted to  but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor  writhing in agony  with my last ounces of energy  i tried to reach the remote but couldnt  a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven  who then proceeds to  pigmalionize  him  lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson  but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up  this may seem like a rather thin plot  but this noisy movie is so chock full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all  this movie is relentless  forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayers  reign in blood   as in a south park episode   whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world  its all infantile   as if they were all 6 year olds impersonating grown ups  i can only envy people who find movies like this funny  it must be great being easy to please  what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious  gut busting comedy   but lets examine this phenomenon  the 50s musical  my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven  depending on whether youre church going or lenins tomb going   or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy inspired places  ttono is more akin to a representation of hell  but thats just me  i dont seem to  get  musicals  people talk  there is a story   but then all of a sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened  when you think about it  musicals are stranger than any science fiction film  worse yet  ttono  my favourite type of pizza  btw  is not just a 50s musical  but one with opera squealing  opera is proof that there is such a thing as over training a voice   to the point where it becomes an ear piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure  the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet  i tried lowering the volume  i lowered it from 18 to 14  then from 14 to 10  then 8  i ended up lowering it to a 1  which is usually so low that its only heard by specially trained dogs and certain types of marsupials  and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys  take the scene in the small boat in the river  danza starts off with one of his deafening  brain killing tunes  and then    nothing  no animals anywhere to be seen  even the crocodiles  who are mostly deaf  have all but left  if you look carefully  you might even see the trees change colour  from green to yellow  in a matter of minutes  no  this was not a continuity error  it was plain old torture of the flora  and those trees were just matte paintings  imagine how real trees would have reacted  the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency  but because glass is only human   hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self explosion  i can listen to the loudest  least friendly death metal band for hours  but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache

"...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is probably the worst film I have ever seen next to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate""... and I have seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. <br /><br />This is just a crummy B movie, bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) The thing I really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the ""heroes"" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! <br /><br />To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing. But honestly, this was probably a bad film to begin with, so Crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it. <br /><br />This really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. I wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /><br />Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie.
