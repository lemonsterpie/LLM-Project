"He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was no `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he showed his brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia', he pulled a slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `The Hurricane', he provided us effective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most moving film of the year. This tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am your acting father'. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the acting `Master D' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material. I hail to the chief `Mr. Washington' in catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Excellent",1,he glorified himself as a great supporting actor in  glory  he proved he was no  malcolm in the middle mediocre actor in  malcolm x  he showed his brotherly love for acting in  philadelphia  he pulled a slam dunk in  he got game  he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in  the hurricane  he provided us effective thespian education in  training day  and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct  denzel washingtons directorial debut  antwone fisher is the most moving film of the year  this tearjerker  fisher story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the miami dolphins in the 4th quarter against the new england patriots in the last game of the 2002 season  unlike that dolphin tragedy   antwone fisher possesses an emotional joyous conclusion  the movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child  denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother  derek lukes debut performance as antwone is the best admirable acting i have seen by a novice actor in some time now  i actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in lukes acting as i have seen in washingtons past performances  it was like if washington was telling luke    la la la luke i am your acting father  ok  i will lay off the star wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away  speaking of the great denzel  his work as the psychologist was masterful  but what can you expect from the acting  master d himself   antwone fisher was written by no other than antwone fisher himself  the emotional pathos he inserted in his storylifes screenplay was of  fisher king material  i hail to the chief  mr  washington in catching the right bait in  antwone fisher        excellent
"I was watching this with one of my friends, who is a vampire freak, and I was extremely disgusted at the fact that this film exists. This film should be shown to prisoners of war, yes, it's that bad. Even John McCain wouldn't be able to sit through this. So why the 3/10 rating? Because it had a vampire midget. Come on, what's more entertaining than a vampire midget? There's one scene in this film where John Savage gets laid by saying ""I want to feel human again,"" and the chick, being the brainless stripper slut she is, lets him ""feel human"". I wish I could ""feel human"" with Jessica Alba or Megan Fox. This is a movie for stoners. There is bright flashy objects and random movements. All in all, don't waste your money on this garbage. I got it for free when I was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a garbage barrel full of video tapes and a sign that said ""free"".

"One of several musicals about sailors on leave, it is the usual sailor meets girl, complications ensue, sorted out happily kind of plot. It proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too. The dialogue is not as zippy as 'Top Hat' for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place.<br /><br />There are compensations. It has some of Irving Berlin's choicest songs including 'Let Yourself Go', 'I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here. They do a snappy tap dance, a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same film! Great versatility and artistry.<br /><br />It also has Harriet Hilliard who is rather good in her role. She had a varied career, becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she is touching without being sentimental.Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. <br /><br />More tightening up have made the film even better.

"Parker and Stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze. Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humour and homilies from the heart.<br /><br />If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us ""Airplane"" and the ""Naked Gun"" series. This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since ""Bullitt"" and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can, but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.<br /><br />For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics. This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. As usual, they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA.<br /><br />A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone's rampaging pair of Cartmans.<br /><br />In summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the ""Naked Gun/Airplane"" formula. Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant (or absolutely awful) if given full control over a future film.

"I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death.

"Over the past year, Uwe Boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker, cranking out the competent ""In the Name of the King"" (a ""Lord of the Rings"" clone) and the proudly vulgar, post-9/11 satire ""Postal."" But then came ""Seed,"" and the counter was reset to Zero, keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach. And I'm a fan of the guyhis films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision, and are never dull.<br /><br />Spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received, ""Seed"" is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary, and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology (Boll often seems to be taking a page from Rob Zombie's successful reboot of ""Halloween""). The antagonist is Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), a mute, hulking brute who's slain 666 people and sits on death row, awaiting execution; after unsuccessfully frying the beast, he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there...and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem.<br /><br />Trying to create a new-millennium slasher in the vein of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression, ultimately resembling a washed-up pro wrestler doing ""The Toolbox Murders"" on a succession of equally boring victims. Furthermore, Seed's character and Boll's ""message"" run contrary to one another: the death penalty is wrong, sure, but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who's left a couple hundred corpses in his wake? I think not.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Michael Pare acts like a listless, long-lost brother to James Remar's character on ""Dexter"": a cop who sits at his desk a lot, thumbing through newspaper clippings, and watching pointless stop-motion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in Seed's lair. By the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm Seed's hideout, the sequence is so drawn-out, ill-conceived (the lighting is almost non-existent), and unexciting (despite a healthy dose of gore) that it almost put me to sleep.<br /><br />The shoddy film-making isn't limited to just that sequence: ""Seed"" appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer, since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly, a technique that's more stomach-turning than the gore itself; these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering, almost non-existent narrative. At 90 minutes, the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture, which might have been Boll's intent all along.<br /><br />Pure genius...I guess the joke's on me.",0,over the past year  uwe boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker  cranking out the competent  in the name of the king   a  lord of the rings  clone  and the proudly vulgar  post 9 11 satire  postal   but then came  seed   and the counter was reset to zero  keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach  and im a fan of the guyhis films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision  and are never dull  spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received   seed  is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary  and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology  boll often seems to be taking a page from rob zombies successful reboot of  halloween    the antagonist is maxwell seed  will sanderson   a mute  hulking brute whos slain 666 people and sits on death row  awaiting execution  after unsuccessfully frying the beast  he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there   and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem  trying to create a new millennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason voorhees  max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression  ultimately resembling a washed up pro wrestler doing  the toolbox murders  on a succession of equally boring victims  furthermore  seeds character and bolls  message  run contrary to one another  the death penalty is wrong  sure  but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer whos left a couple hundred corpses in his wake  i think not  meanwhile  michael pare acts like a listless  long lost brother to james remars character on  dexter   a cop who sits at his desk a lot  thumbing through newspaper clippings  and watching pointless stop motion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in seeds lair  by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm seeds hideout  the sequence is so drawn out  ill conceived  the lighting is almost non existent   and unexciting  despite a healthy dose of gore  that it almost put me to sleep  the shoddy film making isnt limited to just that sequence   seed  appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer  since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly  a technique thats more stomach turning than the gore itself  these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering  almost non existent narrative  at 90 minutes  the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture  which might have been bolls intent all along  pure genius   i guess the jokes on me 
"This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before John Goodman's big-screen version of the life of Babe Ruth came out. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. The TV production isn't perfect but it presents the Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional telling. I especially enjoyed the film's depiction of the complex love-hate relationship Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood his star player's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why Ruth's own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players. The TV-movie rightly notes how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws, while the horrible Goodman version tries to push the falsehood that Ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking.<br /><br />This film makes a great companion piece to ""Eight Men Out"" since the story starts with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox Scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin. Indeed, the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with John Anderson reprising his ""Eight Men Out"" role as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.",1,this 1991 nbc tv movie aired six months before john goodmans big screen version of the life of babe ruth came out  for my money  there is no comparison between the two  the tv production isnt perfect but it presents the babes story with more depth and complexity than goodmans one dimensional telling  i especially enjoyed the films depiction of the complex love hate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins  who always understood his star players brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruths own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players  the tv movie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws  while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking  this film makes a great companion piece to  eight men out  since the story starts with ruths arrival in new york in 1920  one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin  indeed  the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his  eight men out  role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis 
"Wow...I don't know what to say. I just watched Seven Pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. The man is very in-tune with the vast range of human emotion. This movie was skillfully and beautifully done. Rare to find such intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it to ""Pay it Forward"" and ""Crash"" as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way. Definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one. Not usually one for a ""bad ending"" but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion, raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around. Therefore I do not mind a little pain at the end. It is true to life that there aren't always happy endings. Sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be. Many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you'll love this movie!",1,wow   i dont know what to say  i just watched seven pounds  no one can make me cry like will smith  the man is very in tune with the vast range of human emotion  this movie was skillfully and beautifully done  rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today  i would compare it to  pay it forward  and  crash  as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way  definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about  i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one  not usually one for a  bad ending  but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion  raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around  therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end  it is true to life that there arent always happy endings  sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be  many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost  if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest youll love this movie 
"I love cinema so what I'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply. I had given a thumbs down to ""Che, Parts 1 and 2"" without having seen the film. Terrible I know. But I felt into a trap perpetrated by...who? I don't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and, no matter how smart I think I am, I fell into it. But, thankfully, I bumped into an Argeninean film director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I wasn't going to see it because I knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. I went to see both parts straight away and, ""Che, part 1 and 2"" is the best film I've seen in 2008. It is, of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. The regard for its audience is something that we're not used to anymore. I don't know if we ever were. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. The humanity of the man is overwhelming. So, thank you Martin Donovan once again for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film.

"This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The ""wolf"", if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :)<br /><br />The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they didn't do a good job at it.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the actors... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds.

"I don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it. Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about. Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner. Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song. Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s. Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole. Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out.

"The documentary presents an original theory about ""Guns, Germs and Steel"". The series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defend the theory against common criticism.<br /><br />I was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series. They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school. Indeed, it does. In fact, I greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which I have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis.<br /><br />So, if you like knowing WHY things work, if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked, if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this series.

"Although Robert ""Knox"" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them.

"I can see why this film was Oscar-nominated for Best Live Action Short, as it was constructed masterfully. Even if you don't particularly like the Blues (though to me, this sounded much more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this film. It is simply very well made, though for the life of me, I can't see why director Gjon Mili only got to direct one film--this one. In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director didn't get any sort of career boost. As for the black performers, I could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear, as unfortunately most of white society have indifference (or worse) for blacks or ""that kind of music"".<br /><br />If you do watch this film, if you aren't particularly enjoying the earlier portion, skip ahead to about the 5:50 mark--where it picks up considerably. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the pace improved quite a bit.",1,i can see why this film was oscar nominated for best live action short  as it was constructed masterfully  even if you dont particularly like the blues  though to me  this sounded much more like jazz   you can easily appreciate this film  it is simply very well made  though for the life of me  i cant see why director gjon mili only got to direct one film  this one  in other words  the film is nominated and yet the director didnt get any sort of career boost  as for the black performers  i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear  as unfortunately most of white society have indifference  or worse  for blacks or  that kind of music   if you do watch this film  if you arent particularly enjoying the earlier portion  skip ahead to about the 5 50 mark  where it picks up considerably  when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise  the pace improved quite a bit 
"This movie was excellent, a bit scary, but excellent at that. For those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story, it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did. In the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff, but you never realize just how bad it is, and this movie makes you realize. It's seriously that good. It also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that's for sure. I read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think, this movie makes me worry and scares me to death. On the downside it's like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers. I recently received a threat, and I blew it off thinking nothing of it, but after this movie I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are, so take it seriously and don't under estimate someone.",1,this movie was excellent  a bit scary  but excellent at that  for those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story  it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did  in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff  but you never realize just how bad it is  and this movie makes you realize  its seriously that good  it also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone thats for sure  i read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think  this movie makes me worry and scares me to death  on the downside its like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers  i recently received a threat  and i blew it off thinking nothing of it  but after this movie i think you should take everything seriously  some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are  so take it seriously and dont under estimate someone 
"David Chase's ""The Sopranos"" is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory. Not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion, it's devoid of a soul. As anyone reading likely knows already, James Gandolfini *IS* Tony Soprano, a big, fat a**hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b*tch of a wife, and two bratty, sh*t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of America (that's New Jersey, by the way). Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer, he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag, with a crew of ""Saturday Night Live"" skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates. It's not the fact that Tony is a piece of sh*t mobster that offends me (and apparently only me). Allowing characters to be who and what they are, without judgment, is something American TV hardly allows. But Chase - and his entourage of money-gorged, Emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave, nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of (even obviously fictionalized) organized crime (a la ""The Godfather""). Instead, Chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy, violent, and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony, his wife, and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week (or should I say month after month. Or is it year after year? It seems like the show's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse). Much has been made of the series' refusal to adhere to ""network"" structure, with plot lines that go nowhere, and characters that pop-up and disappear like backyard vermin. But if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure, why does it always feel like I'm watching a soap-opera? Tired mob clichés, bored housewives, self-serving, irredeemable characters AND plots that go nowhere. More than ever, I can see why so many Americans of Italian heritage are p*ssed at this show. It's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book (Danté's ""Inferno"" springs to mind).<br /><br />People on IMDb love to claim that there's nothing good on television, and therefore ""The Sopranos"" is a breath of fresh air. Are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch ""The Shield""? (It's included in Basic, ya know). How about the (still good) ""The West Wing""? Or the brilliantly acted (if erratically written) ""Boston Legal""? What about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades, ""Arrested Development""? And lest we forget that we live in an age of DVDs - nobody *has* to watch *anything* new. I'd much rather shell out $40 for an over-priced boxed set of, well, pretty much *anything*, than give HBO $10 a month (or $80 a DVD set!) to continue to prove how much of a hack-factory it can be.<br /><br />You want good television? Watch ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" Or ""Murder One"". Or ""Picket Fences"". Or even Chase's prior show, ""Northern Exposure."" If you're already among ""The Sopranos""'s legion of brain-washed fans and critics, it's too late for you. But if not, leave Tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes.

"I consider this film to be the best one about Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's performance the definitive Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's script is excellent and contains many improvements on Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he makes fine use of light and shadow. The camera work by John Alton is top-notch, as is the score by Franz Waxman. The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the finest private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have received more opportunities.

"Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better.

"Warning: mild spoilers.<br /><br />The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in American history and World Religious history. This movie portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on the earth. I've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing.<br /><br />Joseph Smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents.<br /><br />Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what Mormons call the First Vision was interestingly portrayed. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is sweetened at least slightly by Joseph's marriage to Emma.<br /><br />This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. This is not a critique - simply a note about the style.<br /><br />The practice of tarring and feathering is shown, and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon about the Savior's love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked.<br /><br />The movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of Mormonism as an infant church, while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments.<br /><br />The film shows many scenes from Joseph's life, including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his endless love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious sentiments, and his compassion.<br /><br />As Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from throughout the movie, whose lives had been touched by Joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful.<br /><br />At the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed, and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed.<br /><br />When I first watched the movie I assumed it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think that is the case, although I hope the movie can do just that. As an insider, I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. I am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic, an epic story of an American religious man, or something else.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.",1,warning  mild spoilers  the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing   even moving   episode in american history and world religious history  this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith  whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth  ive so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing  joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers  alvin  hyrum   joseph  who  at a very young age  needed an operation  the operation  done without our modern conveniences  was bloody and difficult  the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents  josephs religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed  the face of jesus is never shown  but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands  the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by josephs marriage to emma  this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history  but merely jumps from scene to scene  this is not a critique   simply a note about the style  the practice of tarring and feathering is shown  and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the saviors love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked  the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church  while at the same time the ever deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments  the film shows many scenes from josephs life  including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma  an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of josephs life  including his fierce love for his wife  his endless love for children  his wit  his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition  his religious sentiments  and his compassion  as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage  never to return home alive  most of the characters from throughout the movie  whose lives had been touched by joseph  are shown along the way  helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful  at the end  the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed  and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed  when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non members  i no longer think that is the case  although i hope the movie can do just that  as an insider  i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him  i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film   whether they will simply see it as propagandic  an epic story of an american religious man  or something else  the film is beautifully shot  family friendly  moving and  hopefully  something good for everyone  that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture   including freedom of religious expression and respect  generally  for the law   we moderns take for granted

"A battleship is sinking... Its survivors, hanging onto a nearby liferaft, sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks.<br /><br />Even though Noel Coward's name is the only one that you notice during the credits, everything that's cinematic in it is because of Lean. And on technical terms, its very good. David Lean just KNEW films from the get-go. There are many moments where Coward's studied dialogue takes a second seat and Lean's visual sense takes centre stage. Try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end, and that whole scene; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing, the scene where we're inside a house that gets bombed.<br /><br />Noel Coward is one of the worst actors i've ever seen. He's totally wooden, not displaying emotion, character or humanity. You can see it in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other performer is saying, he's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line.<br /><br />7/10.<br /><br />Its episodic, a bit repetitive, and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: there's no central story that they advance, just give general insights into the characters. Still, its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for Lean.

"I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. I remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants. What I didn't remember was HOW AWFUL IT WAS!!!<br /><br />I recently caught this movie on television late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the pinnacle of her career playing Chrissy on 'Three's Company') plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest. Or should I say, a *MAN-EATING ANTS' NEST*!! One of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants. One minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one, the next minute he's covered in them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.<br /><br />If you thought that was pretty far-fetched, you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the Manor via helicopter! I could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie!<br /><br />The final scenes depict Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered in ants.<br /><br />That's basically the movie. There's really no ""disaster"" appeal or ""big-star"" draw to the film. It was intended to be a 'grand-scale' television event at the time. Now, it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4:00am timeslot on your local television station.<br /><br />If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of Three's Company.

"I went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. I just wanted to check it out. I was not expecting much of anything. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenplay writer? Not possible for so much talent to reside in one person. Right?? <br /><br />Wrong!! Obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up Hollywood special effects. The story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along. As the credits roll by, you suddenly realize you were glued until the end.<br /><br />At times, the acting seems a little over the top. I do, however, believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character. Otherwise, I wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed.<br /><br />It's worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something I either missed or forgot about the first time or two around.<br /><br />I completely recommend this movie.

"This film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950's and '60's. But it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves. The best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer. This is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like David are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws.<br /><br />The actors are all first rate in the film from Gilbert Barnett as David's second son Absolom through to the wonderful Susan Hayward as Bathsheba. Hayward is at her best in this film. Her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here. She is ever the seductress, but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her.<br /><br />Raymond Massey does a great job as Nathan the prophet. As a child when I first saw the film, Massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the Lord himself and was an awesome sight. No doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing Alfred Newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like ""The Robe"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" along with perhaps 100 other films too! The cinema photography by Leon Shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film. Henry King, a truly underrated film director who like William Wyler never really pigeon-holed himself into any one genre, pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between David and Bathsheba and David's own deep struggle with his faith in God. The path tread in this film could have been very hokey, but King keeps it real and interesting all the way. Plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of God, just as David himself is struggling with the same. From the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction. David is not satisfied with Nathan's answer, (to paraphrase)that no one can understand the will of God. This is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where David is finally confronted with himself.<br /><br />Finally this film belongs to Gregory Peck who wonderful as King David. His David is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms. This is one of his best performances.<br /><br />I don't see this movie on television much anymore, but when I do I never fail to watch it. I think it still holds up very well today.",1,this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950s and 60s  but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves  the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer  this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws  the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as davids second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba  hayward is at her best in this film  her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here  she is ever the seductress  but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her  raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet  as a child when i first saw the film  massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight  no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like  the robe  and  the greatest story ever told  along with perhaps 100 other films too  the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film  henry king  a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeon holed himself into any one genre  pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and davids own deep struggle with his faith in god  the path tread in this film could have been very hokey  but king keeps it real and interesting all the way  plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god  just as david himself is struggling with the same  from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction  david is not satisfied with nathans answer   to paraphrase that no one can understand the will of god  this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself  finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david  his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms  this is one of his best performances  i dont see this movie on television much anymore  but when i do i never fail to watch it  i think it still holds up very well today 
"As some other comments show, this movie might scare you, when you're a little child. (And that is probably all that it is good for.)<br /><br />However, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: suck majorly -and thereby I don't mean the acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like that. I'm simply talking about the ""plot"" (if you can call it that). <br /><br />SPOILERS ahead ------------------------<br /><br />I don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if after reading this, you really still want to watch this movie) but if you graduated from any school, this is just a big insult of your intelligence. When watching this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was just THAT stupid.<br /><br />This includes:<br /><br />-the forming of UNITE (an evil UN-association) <br /><br />--> we are just supposed to believe it's evil. is it even evil at all? if so: why is it evil?<br /><br />-the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /><br />--> there is no necessity to impose this on the people, so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? <br /><br />-inviting Christ to your heart merely as lip service <br /><br />-->because there's nothing anybody, who in this movie is considered ""a real Christian"", ever does, besides saying that stupid prayer. so...just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what?! <br /><br />Thus, rating 1/10",0,as some other comments show  this movie might scare you  when youre a little child   and that is probably all that it is good for   however  if youre older  this movie only does one thing  suck majorly  and thereby i dont mean the acting  its soundtrack  cutting or s th  like that  im simply talking about the  plot   if you can call it that    spoilers ahead                          i dont want to give any more spoilers than necessary  if after reading this  you really still want to watch this movie  but if you graduated from any school  this is just a big insult of your intelligence  when watching this  i was stunned most of the time  because what was happening was just that stupid  this includes   the forming of unite  an evil un association       we are just supposed to believe its evil  is it even evil at all  if so  why is it evil   the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo      there is no necessity to impose this on the people  so why the hell  no pun intended  are they doing it    inviting christ to your heart merely as lip service     because theres nothing anybody  who in this movie is considered  a real christian   ever does  besides saying that stupid prayer  so   just say that prayer before the rapture and youre saved   no matter what    thus  rating 1 10
"I liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem I quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody).<br /><br />There is no real twist (which is fine) , but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either (how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film, if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror?).<br /><br />Admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively creepy, but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull.",0,i liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem i quickly found is that one pretty much knows whats going to happen within the first 20 30 minutes   the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody   there is no real twist  which is fine    but the final reveal doesnt make a great deal of sense either  how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film  if shes an evil id from beyond the mirror    admittedly the scenes beyond the mirror were chilling when they first appeared and the blondes murder is also effectively creepy  but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script  piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80 90 minutes does not really cut it  in fact it gets quite dull 
"This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful.",0,this is one of the dumbest films  ive ever seen  it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all  theres not a single good line or character in the whole mess  if there was a plot  it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes  theres nothing good to say so ill say nothing  i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released  does somebody somewhere not at some stage think  oh my god this really is a load of shite and call it a day  its crap like this that has people downloading illegally  the trailer looks like a completely different film  at least if you have download it  you havent wasted your time or money dont waste your time  this is painful

"First of all, DO NOT call this a remake of the '63 film. Even though this version is truer to the stage play, it is Extremely long. The casting was good with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. She was almost 30 when she did this film, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly overdoes her part as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny as Harry McAffee, and showed he could even hold a tune. Like the '63 film, they casted an unknown to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as Birdie and it showed. I even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing. So what made this a TV ratings flop? It was lengthy for one. They put in new songs and scenes. Even though some of the new songs were good (like ""Let's Settle Down""), was it really necessary? Now don't get me wrong, I liked it, but I rather watch the '63 film (see my review). This was just a case of some actors overdoing roles, making some changes, and once again, LENGTH. One more thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with the role and the music. Give her any lyrics and she could sing them. So here is my advice coming from someone who's done a couple productions of Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to watch an entertaining take on the play, watch the '63 film. If you want to watch a version that is truer to the play, watch the '95 version. Just take it in moderation though. Don't be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting.",1,first of all  do not call this a remake of the 63 film  even though this version is truer to the stage play  it is extremely long  the casting was good with some exceptions  chyna phillips was not a good casting choice  she was almost 30 when she did this film  and it was hard to believe she was a teenager  jason alexander was good choice  but after a while he gave me a headache  tyne daly overdoes her part as mae peterson  george wendt was funny as harry mcaffee  and showed he could even hold a tune  like the 63 film  they casted an unknown to play conrad birdie  marc kudisch had fun with his role as birdie and it showed  i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing  so what made this a tv ratings flop  it was lengthy for one  they put in new songs and scenes  even though some of the new songs were good  like  lets settle down    was it really necessary  now dont get me wrong  i liked it  but i rather watch the 63 film  see my review   this was just a case of some actors overdoing roles  making some changes  and once again  length  one more thing i forgot to mention is vanessa williams  she does a good job with the role and the music  give her any lyrics and she could sing them  so here is my advice coming from someone whos done a couple productions of bye bye birdie  if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play  watch the 63 film  if you want to watch a version that is truer to the play  watch the 95 version  just take it in moderation though  dont be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting 
"I love this movie, but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid.<br /><br />The fateful game took place in 1972. That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all of the music played at the dances etc. is from the 1950s and very early 1960s.<br /><br />Having just attended my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music.<br /><br />I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically. But it wasn't completely bereft, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film.<br /><br />This was a bad director and/or producer decision.",1,i love this movie  but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid  the fateful game took place in 1972  that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972  but almost all of the music played at the dances etc  is from the 1950s and very early 1960s  having just attended my 30th high school reunion  i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents music  i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music    we all know what a desolate time it was musically  but it wasnt completely bereft  and the producers of the film should have taken more care  i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film  this was a bad director and or producer decision 
"What an utter disappointment! The score of 6,1 here on IMDb built up some mild expectations but, oh my, was I disappointed. The first thing that bugs me are those braindead, stereotyped university kids. Yes, I know teens can be childish and so on, but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons? There was one character that I thought was alright, but he/she (not revealing it here) was killed off way before the end. The other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero/heroine just didn't do it for me. On the plus side: The plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks. The acting was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But it all fails with bland and braindead characters. You just stop caring about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and thats being generous).",0,what an utter disappointment  the score of 6 1 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but  oh my  was i disappointed  the first thing that bugs me are those braindead  stereotyped university kids  yes  i know teens can be childish and so on  but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons  there was one character that i thought was alright  but he she  not revealing it here  was killed off way before the end  the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero heroine just didnt do it for me  on the plus side  the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks  the acting was generally not very good  rutger hauer stands out in a small role  but it all fails with bland and braindead characters  you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes  4 10  and thats being generous  
"I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights. Instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning, even though i tried watching it twice!! <br /><br />It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie but it didn't amount to much as the actors lacked likability. For something a little similar Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and overall enjoyability.<br /><br />OK, so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans out there, but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it. If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas.",0,i was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the arabian nights  instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning  even though i tried watching it twice    it was a bonus that caradine was in this movie but it didnt amount to much as the actors lacked likability  for something a little similar zorro with anthony hopkins and bandaras is much better for action  comic moments and overall enjoyability  ok  so son of the dragon has many possible fans out there  but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it  if you just want the kids to settle down on a sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas 
"I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (as the vampiress Quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this movie.<br /><br />Certainly there is very little logic to this movie, but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flicks. The movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable, but ridiculous.<br /><br />There is too much gore and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me feel sick. A good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood -- we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he/she is going to do what a vampire will do. A few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene (like the one at end when Quintana tries to sexually arouse Rosa, all it needs is a few moans, the rest is your imagination).

"I remember this film, exhibit in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for the time of a week.

The Projected Man). Few people saw it (luckly people, no doubt) and no reference about this very boring SF movie can be found in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopidie, or about the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember of it, after all this years, a no-story, a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact, and no more.

"I had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's passing with numerous unwatched films of his that I own on VHS; however, given my ongoing light-hearted Christmas marathon, I had to make do with just this one! As it happens, it features one of his best performances - and he was justly Oscar-nominated for it (with the film itself being likewise honored). This was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely-recognized star to emerge from Italy, Sophia Loren; both, incidentally, are playing against type here - she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual! <br /><br />By the way, the film's title has a double meaning: the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage), but it more specifically refers to the stars' 'brief encounter' in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, briefly, passion - though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, which leads to the film's abrupt bittersweet ending. This is virtually a two-hander (with all other characters - save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety - which include Loren's gruff and fervently patriotic husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, appear only at the beginning and closing sequences); still, the cramped setting doesn't deter director Scola (for the record, this is the 7th film of his that I've watched and own 3 more on VHS) and cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, so that the result - though essentially low-key - is far from stagy: the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building, observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires, but always keenly.<br /><br />The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing, and they both deliver (their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable); it's interesting, however, that while Loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf, it's Mastroianni's moving yet unsentimental outsider (the film, somewhat dubiously, does seem to equate his sexual deviance with Anti-Fascism!) who generally impressed international audiences!",1,i had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of marcello mastroiannis passing with numerous unwatched films of his that i own on vhs  however  given my ongoing light hearted christmas marathon  i had to make do with just this one  as it happens  it features one of his best performances   and he was justly oscar nominated for it  with the film itself being likewise honored   this was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely recognized star to emerge from italy  sophia loren  both  incidentally  are playing against type here   she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual   by the way  the films title has a double meaning  the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which hitler came to italy to meet mussolini  the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage   but it more specifically refers to the stars brief encounter in which they share moments of friendship  revelation and  briefly  passion   though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable  which leads to the films abrupt bittersweet ending  this is virtually a two hander  with all other characters   save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety   which include lorens gruff and fervently patriotic husband  surprisingly played by john vernon  appear only at the beginning and closing sequences   still  the cramped setting doesnt deter director scola  for the record  this is the 7th film of his that ive watched and own 3 more on vhs  and cinematographer pasqualino de santis  so that the result   though essentially low key   is far from stagy  the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building  observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires  but always keenly  the narrative  of course  depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing  and they both deliver  their on screen chemistry is quite incomparable   its interesting  however  that while loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf  its mastroiannis moving yet unsentimental outsider  the film  somewhat dubiously  does seem to equate his sexual deviance with anti fascism   who generally impressed international audiences

"Though derivative, ""Labyrinth"" still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. Finally a story allows Welling to show how he has grown as an actor. It's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of ""truth, justice, and the American way"" on a weekly basis with very little variation. His performance, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie, was quite believable.<br /><br />Welling rose to the occasion marvelously.<br /><br />As always, Michael Rosenbaum, as the ""handicapped"" Lex, delivered, as did Kristen Kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed Lana. Allison Mack, the ever-present Chloe, also scored as a slightly ""off-her-rocker"" version.<br /><br />The use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama.",1,though derivative   labyrinth  still stands as the highlight of the mid half of the six year old show  finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor  its not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of  truth  justice  and the american way  on a weekly basis with very little variation  his performance  permitting him to show how one might react if he she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie  was quite believable  welling rose to the occasion marvelously  as always  michael rosenbaum  as the  handicapped  lex  delivered  as did kristen kreuk as a too sweet to be believed lana  allison mack  the ever present chloe  also scored as a slightly  off her rocker  version  the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama 
"Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw ""Spirited Away."" I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is ""Castle in the Sky."" Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as ""Spirited Away"" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).<br /><br />A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.<br /><br />Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.<br /><br />Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for ""The Last Picture Show,"" but she's annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend seeing ""Castle in the Sky."" I'll probably end up buying it myself. But even though it's not as good as ""Spirited Away,"" it's still pretty good.",1,like many americans  i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw  spirited away   i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times  now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki  one of his earlier works is  castle in the sky   although its still enjoyable  its not as good as  spirited away   though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair   a young boy named pazu  james van der beek  is working in a mine late one night  when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky  when she wakes up the next morning  she introduces herself as sheeta  anna paquin   but sheeta has a secret  and before he knows it  pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates  the army and a lost floating city  going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing  a sense of wonder and magic  many filmmakers have tried  but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki  watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood  because the film is animated  dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words  it also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and voiced by talented actors  the voice acting is varied  james van der beek fares best  he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character  anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta  shes frightened by the events going on around her  but she knows what she has to do  mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska  hes dangerous and wants something from sheeta  and will do anything to get it  the other voices are bad  cloris leachman is awful as dola  leachman may have won an oscar for  the last picture show   but shes annoying as the pirate leader  leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk thats nearly always monotonous  its so bad it nearly ruins the film  jim cummings is an effective voice over actor  but hes miscast as the general  i would definitely recommend seeing  castle in the sky   ill probably end up buying it myself  but even though its not as good as  spirited away   its still pretty good 
"As a young black/latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I didn't. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a film like ""Raising Victor"" over this one any day. I just was not too impressed.",0,as a young black latina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me  of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it  unfortunately  i didnt  although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant  the story was simply not properly developed  the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film  had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes  perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more  honestly  i would recommend a film like  raising victor  over this one any day  i just was not too impressed 
"1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and un-spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated `101 Dalmatians.' Yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first one, but the problem is that it plays out much like the original. One of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story, which this one doesn't have. The animation is also very un-spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again. When is Disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re-do's etc.. etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out.",0,1st watched 2 2 2003   4 out of 10 dir jim kammerud   brian smith   drab and un spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated  101 dalmatians  yes  the movie continues where it ended in the first one  but the problem is that it plays out much like the original  one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story  which this one doesnt have  the animation is also very un spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again  when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re dos etc   etc  probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out 
"When this play was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been something quite different for the time. So therefor some people would have found it quite scary, and may well have been impressed with the special effects?<br /><br />Looking at the play in this day and age, It doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore, even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Would a train really be allowed to pass a RED LIGHT into a dark tunnel? I don't think so......but if you watch this play again, you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel, rushes straight through the RED LIGHT! (maybe that's how it was in dickens time)?<br /><br />You will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the Signal Box is very steep and in a poor state. Surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the Signalman to climb up or down into the cutting. (i can't help but notice things like that)<br /><br />I will not take anything away from the acting, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveller) gave wonderful performances.<br /><br />I am not at all sure what is going on......I mean was the ghost the traveller, or what??? Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story??? (well maybe i am the only one that don't)???<br /><br />To sum up.....<br /><br />The play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout, with great character. It suffers from not being that scary these days, and a little if not very confusing in places, and has some rather unusual signalling practises....<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.",0,when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago  it would have been something quite different for the time  so therefor some people would have found it quite scary  and may well have been impressed with the special effects  looking at the play in this day and age  it doesnt seem to be all that scary anymore  even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired  would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel  i dont think so      but if you watch this play again  you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel  rushes straight through the red light   maybe thats how it was in dickens time   you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state  surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting   i cant help but notice things like that  i will not take anything away from the acting  both denholm elliott  signalman  and bernard lloyd  the traveller  gave wonderful performances  i am not at all sure what is going on      i mean was the ghost the traveller  or what    does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story     well maybe i am the only one that dont     to sum up      the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout  with great character  it suffers from not being that scary these days  and a little if not very confusing in places  and has some rather unusual signalling practises     thanks for reading my review 
"Or listening to, for that matter. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /><br />Honestly, this isn't the worst gay movie I've seen (that would be Regarding Billy), but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />This thing drags and drags and drags. It's not that the plot is inane--in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining. There's not one plot point you can't see coming for ten miles down the road. The dialog is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it's full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /><br />Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamic, in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we're just told they're in love. Hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren't compatible sexually. They like the same book? Huh?<br /><br />The acting is not totally bad, but the pacing is excruciatingly slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch- slow, but without Jarmusch quality. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you.

"It was Jon Pertwee who said "" It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly "" . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is "" Very easy "" . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK.. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin .<br /><br />PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter .

"I am not an artistically inclined individual. I am a science minded woman and I felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget. I watched part of it with my fiancé and my future step daughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiancé and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to Ocean's 13,but that is another story. Not to be deterred I awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot. I began again watching this movie in earnest. I just don't get it,I thought I would get it.I thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers. Interesting and still it had dead stuff inside. It was an odd and bizarre movie.

"I was pleasantly surprised I quite liked this movie. Witty writing (some ""inside"" jokes I got, others I didn't - maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another), great acting (notably John Cassini), great cameos, interesting and unique directing. I rented it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed he was in it such a short time, blink and you'll miss him!) but found the movie remarkably entertaining. I'll actually watch it again before I send back to Netflix. I think actors and wanna-be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie. The ending is somewhat expected but wish they'd done something different (and more positive). Too bad the movie wasn't better received except for in the ""festival"" market.

"According to IMDb Takashi Miike's Master of Horror-segment, Imprint, was banned in the US. So I figured I'd translate the Swedish review I just wrote for it...<br /><br />It was hard to NOT have any sort of expectations from Ichi The Killer-director Takashi Miike's episode in the Masters of Horror series. And the DVD-cover of Imprint did in deed look very promising.<br /><br />The story mostly takes place in a remote Japanese bordello, some time during the 19th century, and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for Komomo, the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for. Tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello, hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and quiet girl, know about Komomo, and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left. The story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow...<br /><br />The first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent American-English. But I will leave it at that, it's not that big a deal. What IS a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was. Miike's tale moves at such a slow pace that I couldn't help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes. The extended torure-scene, that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie, felt so unmotivated - and pornographically intrusive - that not even THAT scene became interesting. I felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself - with no sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water...and, in all honesty, the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust.<br /><br />The journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by Billy Drago, for me most memorable as Frank Nitti - Al Capones whiteclad assassin in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables (1987). I've always found Dragos portrayal of Nitti to be very icy (and I mean that in a good way), and that is probably why I was almost annoyed when I found him to be so terrible (NOT in a good way) in this one. His acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting. When his character is supposed to react to the awful things Komomo has been subjected to I was sitting in the sofa, twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by Drago. I'm grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a geisha, 2005), who plays the deformed prostitute.<br /><br />The finale is probably supposed to be chocking, maybe even revolting and horrid, but I just found it to be kind of...you know... ""blah"" (and I looked at my watch again, for the umptieth time, just wishing the crappy episode would end). Maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit, but that's only because I couldn't help thinking of an episode of Red Dwarf, and the upside-down chins of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens... Lucky you, if you've seen that episode and now decide to see Imprint, I will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you.<br /><br />My first thought, when Imprint finally ended, was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it, was hearing the main title theme by Edward Shearmur (the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series), and that - if anything - is a big friggin warning, don't you think?<br /><br />One might point to the costume design, by Michiko Kitamura, and say that there, at least, is something NOT lacking in style and refinement...but there are so many other films and TV-shows that is so much better at showing off the Japanese ""geisha-fashion"". This is nothing but inferior and I am disappointed. Takashi Miike's Masters of Horror-episode is boring, uninspiring and pointless.

"I don't like ""grade inflation"" but I just had to give this a 10. I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure that the Hollywood remake that someone told me about, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that I am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved, or its setting changed to a different culture.<br /><br />A story I found worth watching, and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort! Imagine that!<br /><br />All the characters seemed well-developed, ... even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate. <br /><br />It's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what.<br /><br />To the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.",1,i dont like  grade inflation  but i just had to give this a 10  i cant think of anything i didnt like about it  i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it  im sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about  with j lo and richard gear  will be excellent  but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought provoking for me that i am hard pressed to think of any way that it could be improved  or its setting changed to a different culture  a story i found worth watching  and with o fist fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort  imagine that  all the characters seemed well developed      even non primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting  and the casting seemed very appropriate   its always hard to find a good movie musical in our day and age  and perhaps this doesnt quite qualify  there is plenty of learning how to dance  but no singing  but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man  successful with a family in japan  looking for something    he knows not precisely what  to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film  thank you for creating and doing it 
"This is simply put, the worst movie I have ever seen. It ranges from like 2+ hours, and the box art was totally misleading. My friends and I rented it because, we thought it would be a poor man's 300. You know, to laugh at and make fun of. No. There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then, the movie starts up, and they are speaking some sort of different language. We think, 'Oh its just the beginning.' But no, from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground. Omit Cinematography, and this movie belongs in trash compactor. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.",0,this is simply put  the worst movie i have ever seen  it ranges from like 2  hours  and the box art was totally misleading  my friends and i rented it because  we thought it would be a poor mans 300  you know  to laugh at and make fun of  no  there is nothing funny about this movie  only pain  then  the movie starts up  and they are speaking some sort of different language  we think  oh its just the beginning  but no  from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school  where nothing literally happens for hours  and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground  omit cinematography  and this movie belongs in trash compactor  movies like this will lead to the world we see in wall e  which by the way was a good movie 
"This movie is just another average action flick, but it could have been so much better. When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, the one we had been waiting for, but was like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hits, and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old, same old.",0,this movie is just another average action flick  but it could have been so much better  when the guns come out they really needed some choreography help  someone like andy mcnabb   who made that brilliant action sequence in heat as they move up the street from the robbery   would have turned the dull action sequences into something special  because the rest of the film was alright   predictable but watchable   better than you would expect from this type of movie  then came the final scene  the show down  the one we had been waiting for  but was like watching something from the a team in the 80s  they shoot wildly  nothing hits  and they run around a house trying to kill each other   same old  same old 
"Riding Giants<br /><br />This documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer films, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, its follow-up Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son, and Step into Liquid (IMAX). I saw the first, not the others. <br /><br />While the surfing footage is spectacular, I valued most the film-maker's historic perspective. He takes us back to the sport's origins almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it evolved to its present form. This includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California were most frequented by the world-class surfers, and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them. The athletes lived for months at a time on beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary bunks, fished for food, and went back out on their boards the next day. What a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /><br />We see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost to the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the Beachboys' surfing songs like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. The Surfing magazine and Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was such a tome) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport, their families, and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s. One such story is how 40-year old Laird Hamilton, considered today's greatest surfer, bonded with an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his single mom, who he married before becoming his step-dad. <br /><br />A rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. Have I whetted your appetite? Wonderful.

"While this movie's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been, this is still a very good film. In fact, it was seen as an excellent film in its day, as it was nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar (losing to WINGS). I still consider WINGS to be a superior film, but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead, Emil Jannings.<br /><br />Jannings is a general from Czarist Russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a Hollywood extra. His luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call--to play an Imperial Russian general fighting against the Communists during the revolution. Naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting-wise, but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution.<br /><br />Exactly what happens next I'll leave to you, but it's a pretty good film--particularly at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as the Russian director. Despite being made in 1928, with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films.",1,while this movies style isnt as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been  this is still a very good film  in fact  it was seen as an excellent film in its day  as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar  losing to wings   i still consider wings to be a superior film  but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead  emil jannings  jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra  his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call  to play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution  naturally this isnt much of a stretch acting wise  but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution  exactly what happens next ill leave to you  but its a pretty good film  particularly at the end  by the way  look for william powell as the russian director  despite being made in 1928  with the makeup he doesnt look much younger than he did in many of his later films 
"TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickford's films. At two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed.

"Since ""Rugrats""' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years, obviously the tyrants at Klasky-Csupo should be out of ideas. After dumbing down all of the characters, adding even stupider new ones, replacing some voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!), and having no sense of continuity (ex.: in a Kimi episode I watched the other day, Tommy and Chucky each got a new puppy; but it subsequent episode, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy. But noooo.<br /><br />All I will say concerning this special is that it sucks! While not as horrible as the Kimi episodes, everyone is even stupider than they were, including Grandpa (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now, he has no real purpose). The ending is needlessly fluffy, and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ('98-'01) is that the kids can interact with adults.

"You have to figure that when the star's name is listed wrong in the opening credits, you are not in for a good time (the credit reads ""Cuba Gooding, J.R.""). Some nice car chase, shoot 'em up, blow 'em up action if ALL you want is action, because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best, and completely unbelievable. The motivations of the characters, especially that of Gooding's at the end, are worse then unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled.

Duvall and Close portray common people, and you'd never even realize they are now big-name actors. It seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing Eugene's girlfriend, but I guess it's possible. It seems unlikely that the kid would travel from Montana to Nevada by himself, but I guess it's possible.

"Quite unimpressive. The 'twists' are all pretty predictable, if you've seen any movies within the last ten years, and the few somewhat interesting parts (wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much punch, since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained.<br /><br />(spoilers, sorta)<br /><br />The acting is decent enough. The story simply isn't very interesting. The whole 'still awake' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff(not kidding). <br /><br />The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit discomforting, but then becomes utterly banal.<br /><br />Not horrible, but not memorable.

"In Don Siegel's 1971 masterpiece ""Dirty Harry"", Clint Eastwood epitomized the super-tough, super-cool unorthodox, no-nonsense cinema-cop with his role of the eponymous Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan. Two sequels followed, the first of which, ""Magnum Force"", tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences. The second sequel, ""The Enforcer"" was grittier again, and was promoted as ""the dirtiest Harry of them all"". This title, however, truly belongs to the fourth film in the series, Clint Eastwood's own ""Sudden Impact"", which is doubtlessly the grittiest, nastiest, most violent and downright dirtiest of all Harry films, and, in my humble opinion, the second-best after the masterpiece original.<br /><br />***Warning! SPOILERS ahead!*** In a small town near San Francisco, a mysterious sexy lady (Sondra Locke) lures men into being alone with her. What these men don't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim, longing for bloody revenge. As fate wants it, San Francisco's toughest cop, Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan, who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors, spends his leisure time in this exact little town... ""Sudden Impact"" is the dirtiest Callahan film in several aspects. The film is extremely gritty and graphically violent. Harry Callahan himself is dirtier than ever. Not afraid to make use of his 44. Magnum in order to stop trouble, Harry treats 'punks' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge-murders are justified in his opinion. Clint Eastwood is, as always, brilliant in the role of Harry Callahan. Eastwood epitomized coolness and bad-assery as the ""Man With No Name"" in Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy, and he did so again in the Dirty Harry films. ""Sudden Impact"" gives us the dirtiest Harry we have ever seen. Eastwood's real-life girlfriend Sondra Locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty. The great Pat Hingle, who had already worked with Eastwood in Ted Post's tough-minded Western ""Hang 'Em High"" in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town. The film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters, including a pathetic criminal played by Kevin Major Howard (best known for his role in Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"") and a woman named Ray Perkins (Audrie J. Neenan), doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema. Albert Popwell, who played the bank robber in the famous ""Do You Feel Lucky?"" scene in ""Dirty Harry"" and the black militant leader in ""The Enforcer"" is also part of this one again, this time as Harry's colleague and buddy. Overall ""Sudden Impact"" is the grittiest, dirtiest and probably the most violent of all ""Dirty Harry"" films, (though ""The Dead Pool"" isn't exactly tame either), and my second-favorite after the brilliant 1971 original. An absolute must-see for Callahan fans, and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad-assery.

"Although I had seen ""Gymkata"" in a theater way back in '85, I couldn't remember anything of the plot except for vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending.<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews I picked up a copy of the newly released DVD to once again enter the world of Gymkata.<br /><br />It turns out this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today. The film stars champion gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of ""Parmistan"" to enter and hopefully win ""The Game,"" a suicidal bloodsport sponsored by the Khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like ""Yak Power."" The goal of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. Once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white. Needless to say Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a date with destiny, and the Game.<br /><br />Star, Kurt Thomas was ill served by director Robert Clouse, who it looks like was never on the set. The so called script is just this side of incompetent. See other reviews for the many howlers throughout. The town of crazies has a few good moments, but is ultimately ruined by bad editing. The ending...meh. Still there's the germ of a good action adventure here.

"Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. ""The Thief of Bagdad"" was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me. I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading ""The Arabian Nights."" I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.<br /><br />Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including ""A Matter of Life and Death"" (aka ""Stairway to Heaven"") and ""The Red Shoes."" He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles.<br /><br />As with all great works of art, the beauty of ""The Thief of Bagdad"" lies in the detail. Every frame has its own magical charm. The story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving.

"Outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", only done on a low budget and much campier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: ""Mona, you're a brick!""<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute delight. Expect a little ""Raiders.."", a dash of ""Batman"", a little ""The Lost World"", a little ""Lost Horizons"" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A prime candidate for DVD release, it is certainly overdue. An unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10",1,outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s  it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series  as much as  raiders of the lost ark   only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson  the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau  predating batman by two decades  starring ron ely  tarzan  as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non existent latin american country of hidalgo  best line  our hero to mona  holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug   mona  youre a brick   paul wexlers ham and cheese blackhat  captain seas is a an absolute delight  expect a little  raiders     a dash of  batman   a little  the lost world   a little  lost horizons  and a whole lot of campiness and youll get it just right  watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousas patriotic music  a prime candidate for dvd release  it is certainly overdue  an unmissable treat for the whole family  9 10
"""Raising Victor Vargas"" is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y. Times crossword puzzle at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you don't have to ""Pause"" the DVD. Just let it roll, 'cause you won't be missing anything really important. No twists, turns, or tension. It's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It made very little difference. I've seen it all a zillion times before. Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family. Just the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze. <br /><br />It's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some the Bronx, and another Brooklyn. As a life-long New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos. They lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave. Some interaction with non-Latinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension. Remember West Side Story?<br /><br />And now for the oft-criticized cinematography. I don't know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me. The apt, the furniture, and the faces were all ORANGE. What was that supposed to mean? And the apt. did look pretty cramped to me. Somebody here mentioned that the old apt's/tenements had very big rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them. <br /><br />And another annoying thing ....This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy ""jerking off"". Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch? Please spare me! What's up with these directors? <br /><br />So ""Victor Vargas"" is a pleasant little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. But the writers let them down, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with.

"This movie is SOOOO funny!!! The acting is WONDERFUL, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his/her school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, You will love this film. This movie is a tad bit ""grease""esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are likable; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through. This musical ranks number two in musicals to me (second next to the blues brothers). But please, do not think of it as a musical per say; seeing as how the songs are so likable, it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place. I think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance. You will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; needless to say, you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film. Highly recommended for both the family (since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience.",1,this movie is soooo funny    the acting is wonderful  the ramones are sexy  the jokes are subtle  and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his her school  i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism  if you like monty python  you will love this film  this movie is a tad bit  grease esk  without all the annoying songs   the songs that are sung are likable  you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through  this musical ranks number two in musicals to me  second next to the blues brothers   but please  do not think of it as a musical per say  seeing as how the songs are so likable  it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place  i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance  you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager  needless to say  you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film  highly recommended for both the family  since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience 
"First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. However, in this piece of @*!^ called SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank.<br /><br />First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnam vet named Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. Therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. Had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with.<br /><br />Now, the acting. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that this was some of the WORST acting in the history of the art!!!!! Lamas is, well, himself. The jackasses playing the Clampets/Deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break!<br /><br />Finally, the action. The gunfighting is so-so at BEST, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. I've seen more real-looking fights at the Renaissance Festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!<br /><br />Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS PIECE OF CACA AT ALL COSTS!

"Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is terrific as the younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally is great as the father.

"In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass, this film was probably quite revealing in its day. However, I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan. He organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from. Anyway, De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. It's all down to capitalism of course, and in order to illustrate this, he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. Brilliant! To his credit, though, by this time he has given up on making a serious film, and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures, all fur coats and cigars. They want that land, but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. By a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. He uses it to shower gifts on his mates, who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. I reckon this film was a missed opportunity. To address the theme of poverty , as not many film-makers had done until then, and then get caught up in a fairy tale, to me seems a bit daft. How come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. De Sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this. Surely the fact that these people are so poor, that their faith is unswerving, and that miracles never happen to them, is enough for any story-teller to work on.<br /><br />",0,in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass  this film was probably quite revealing in its day  however  i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sicas bag  since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country  after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage  toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan  he organises the inhabitants into community action  and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables  that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me  as these people have far more important things to think about  like where the next pot noodle is going to come from  anyway  de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are  its all down to capitalism of course  and in order to illustrate this  he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land  brilliant  to his credit  though  by this time he has given up on making a serious film  and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures  all fur coats and cigars  they want that land  but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense  by a bizarre stroke of luck  his old  deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove  he uses it to shower gifts on his mates  who prove just as greedy as the cigar men  i reckon this film was a missed opportunity  to address the theme of poverty   as not many film makers had done until then  and then get caught up in a fairy tale  to me seems a bit daft  how come great directors get away with child like plot turns like the ones we see here  hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks  de sica  however  is proclaimed as a genius for this  surely the fact that these people are so poor  that their faith is unswerving  and that miracles never happen to them  is enough for any story teller to work on 
"This infamous ending to Koen Wauters' career came to my attention through the 'Night of Bad Taste'. Judging by the comment index i wasn't the first and i am not to be the last person in Western Europe to learn that this musician (undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree on that) tried to be an actor. Whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged. <br /><br />In 'Intensive Care' he's quite likable, but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating. No one can blame him. It deserves its ranking in Verheyen's Hall of Fame by all means & standards. The story of the Murderous Maniac Who is Supposed To Have Died In An Accident But Is Alive And Wrathful has been told dozens of times before, and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography.<br /><br /> IC contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses. The pace is dull. The tension looses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score, for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody, followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders, which or largely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them. The sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing. The couple from Amsterdamned could have made it work, though. While dealing with the couple subject : the whole subplot between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victims-to-be, who loosen their nerves halfway through physical intercourse. I will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning, for they should all have been chopped up into tiny greasy pieces. As a matter of fact, most of them do. The ones i recall where obvious for the genre : a pretty nurse and two cops. <br /><br />Hence, in a slasher, the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself. The (anti-) hero has to take out the villain, mostly through clever thinking, for former red berets don't often get parts in these films; they might overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer. Translated to the events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress. <br /><br />No people, i am not finished. This is not how the story goes. Wauters makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to ""A Clockwork Orange"", so it is up to the girl to pick up the driller killer act and pierce through the doctors brains. Though this method ensures the killer's death more than the usual rounds of 9mm bullets, the doctor survives in order to enable IC to reach the 80 min mark.<br /><br />I should have made my point by now. Intensive Care is a bad movie, which can only be enjoyed by Bad Taste lovers, who can verify Verheyen's catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it. For example, the (unintended) parody value of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (the chase at the end of Friday the 13th).<br /><br />However, let me conclude by giving an overview by a few measly elements which give IC a little credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctor/French actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a stand-in. He could have played his Naked Gun part again, to end up as beef, but with a longer screen time. The finale may be one of them. I had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence. It is good for a laugh.<br /><br />Name one good truly point about Intensive Care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career. It makes me wonder how many editions of the Paris-Dakar race he has to abort before coming to his senses.<br /><br />",0,this infamous ending to koen wauters career came to my attention through the night of bad taste  judging by the comment index i wasnt the first and i am not to be the last person in western europe to learn that this musician  undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene  even the dutch agree on that  tried to be an actor  whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged   in intensive care hes quite likable  but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating  no one can blame him  it deserves its ranking in verheyens hall of fame by all means   standards  the story of the murderous maniac who is supposed to have died in an accident but is alive and wrathful has been told dozens of times before  and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography   ic contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses  the pace is dull  the tension looses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score  for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody  followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders  which or largely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them  the sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing  the couple from amsterdamned could have made it work  though  while dealing with the couple subject   the whole subplot between wauters and the girl does not work  a more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victims to be  who loosen their nerves halfway through physical intercourse  i will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning  for they should all have been chopped up into tiny greasy pieces  as a matter of fact  most of them do  the ones i recall where obvious for the genre   a pretty nurse and two cops   hence  in a slasher  the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself  the  anti   hero has to take out the villain  mostly through clever thinking  for former red berets dont often get parts in these films  they might overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer  translated to the events  wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress   no people  i am not finished  this is not how the story goes  wauters makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to  a clockwork orange   so it is up to the girl to pick up the driller killer act and pierce through the doctors brains  though this method ensures the killers death more than the usual rounds of 9mm bullets  the doctor survives in order to enable ic to reach the 80 min mark  i should have made my point by now  intensive care is a bad movie  which can only be enjoyed by bad taste lovers  who can verify verheyens catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it  for example  the  unintended  parody value of the doctors clown mask  halloween  and the final confrontation in the park  the chase at the end of friday the 13th   however  let me conclude by giving an overview by a few measly elements which give ic a little credit  george kennedy is not one of them  all he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctor french actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a stand in  he could have played his naked gun part again  to end up as beef  but with a longer screen time  the finale may be one of them  i had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence  it is good for a laugh  name one good truly point about intensive care     koen wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career  it makes me wonder how many editions of the paris dakar race he has to abort before coming to his senses 
"We're a long way from LAURA. Once again Otto Preminger directs, Dana Andrews stars as a police detective named Mark, and Gene Tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him, but nothing else about WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS resembles everyone's favorite sophisticated murder mystery. Instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty, harrowing realism. While the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of New York society, here we're in the low-rent district of dark streets, hoodlums, cheap restaurants and crummy flats. Tierney, gorgeous as ever, now works as a department-store mannequin and lives in Washington Heights (the neighborhood of the ""doll"" who once got a fox fur out of LAURA's Mark McPherson). This time Andrews is Mark Dixon, an older, sadder, more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat. <br /><br />WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS belongs to a sub-genre of noir, movies about police brutality focusing on cops who can't control their violent impulses. Like Kirk Douglas's character in DETECTIVE STORY, Dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his father's criminal past. Where Douglas is self-righteous and blind to his own faults, Andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and self-loathing. He accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster (Gary Merrill) whom he has been vainly pursuing for years. Instead, a kindly cab driver is suspected because he's the father of the dead man's estranged and mistreated wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). Dixon, falling in love with the wife of the man he killed, tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away. <br /><br />Among noir protagonists, Dana Andrews had this distinction: he was incapable of appearing unintelligent. Even when playing an average Joe, as he usually did, he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive; more than that, his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted--and haunting--quality that was his essence as an actor. He played ordinary guys, cops and soldiers, but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much. His conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion, guilt, the inability ever to ""lighten up."" No other actor could have expressed so well the bottled-up anger, the slow-burning pain, the agonized intelligence of Mark Dixon. He also has a muted tenderness, a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking. This comes out when he takes Morgan to a restaurant where he's a regular, and for the first time we see this cold, brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress, whose sarcasm can't hide her affection and concern for him. When Dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for Morgan's father, he supplies it even though they recently argued and Dixon threw a punch at him. There are no words about loyalty or knowing he's a good guy deep down, but we see it all in the man's anguished silence and his wife's resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn. Dixon's goodness comes across through other people's reactions to him as much as through Andrews's deeply moving performance. <br /><br />Though Dana Andrews was a minor star, he may be the quintessential forties man. He goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat; with that boxy, mid-century silhouette, further fortified by the fedora, the glass of bourbon, the cigarette he doesn't take out of his mouth when he talks, he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity. While many noirs romanticize the two-fisted tough guy, WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the façade, a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence.<br /><br />Andrews was sadly underrated in his own time (he was the only one of the three protagonists in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES not nominated for an Academy Award, though his low-key performance is far more compelling than Frederic March's hammy, Oscar-winning drunk). Fortunately, Andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality, and now at last this little-known film, which contains his best performance, can be seen as part of the marvelous Fox Film Noir set. This series, including a number of never before released titles (such as NIGHTMARE ALLEY and THIEVES' HIGHWAY), suggests that Twentieth-Century-Fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir.",1,were a long way from laura  once again otto preminger directs  dana andrews stars as a police detective named mark  and gene tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him  but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyones favorite sophisticated murder mystery  instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty  harrowing realism  while the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of new york society  here were in the low rent district of dark streets  hoodlums  cheap restaurants and crummy flats  tierney  gorgeous as ever  now works as a department store mannequin and lives in washington heights  the neighborhood of the  doll  who once got a fox fur out of lauras mark mcpherson   this time andrews is mark dixon  an older  sadder  more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat   where the sidewalk ends belongs to a sub genre of noir  movies about police brutality focusing on cops who cant control their violent impulses  like kirk douglass character in detective story  dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his fathers criminal past  where douglas is self righteous and blind to his own faults  andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and self loathing  he accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster  gary merrill  whom he has been vainly pursuing for years  instead  a kindly cab driver is suspected because hes the father of the dead mans estranged and mistreated wife morgan  gene tierney   dixon  falling in love with the wife of the man he killed  tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away   among noir protagonists  dana andrews had this distinction  he was incapable of appearing unintelligent  even when playing an average joe  as he usually did  he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive  more than that  his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted  and haunting  quality that was his essence as an actor  he played ordinary guys  cops and soldiers  but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much  his conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion  guilt  the inability ever to  lighten up   no other actor could have expressed so well the bottled up anger  the slow burning pain  the agonized intelligence of mark dixon  he also has a muted tenderness  a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking  this comes out when he takes morgan to a restaurant where hes a regular  and for the first time we see this cold  brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress  whose sarcasm cant hide her affection and concern for him  when dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for morgans father  he supplies it even though they recently argued and dixon threw a punch at him  there are no words about loyalty or knowing hes a good guy deep down  but we see it all in the mans anguished silence and his wifes resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn  dixons goodness comes across through other peoples reactions to him as much as through andrewss deeply moving performance   though dana andrews was a minor star  he may be the quintessential forties man  he goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat  with that boxy  mid century silhouette  further fortified by the fedora  the glass of bourbon  the cigarette he doesnt take out of his mouth when he talks  he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity  while many noirs romanticize the two fisted tough guy  where the sidewalk ends offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the façade  a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence  andrews was sadly underrated in his own time  he was the only one of the three protagonists in the best years of our lives not nominated for an academy award  though his low key performance is far more compelling than frederic marchs hammy  oscar winning drunk   fortunately  andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality  and now at last this little known film  which contains his best performance  can be seen as part of the marvelous fox film noir set  this series  including a number of never before released titles  such as nightmare alley and thieves highway   suggests that twentieth century fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir 
"This wilfully bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typical Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast. The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of Bunuel's Mexican period, and looks at times like a poor man's take on Lars Von Trier's Elements of Crime. Cox's apparent preference for single takes, jump cuts, and ambient sound recording all work against the film's effectiveness.

"Riveting drama, scripted by William Mastrosimone based on his stage play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in her car by rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do. She realizes, however, that Joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives. When her housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are off at work, Joe pays her a visit to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways, she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him. Knowing full well she's in another ""his word against yours"" situation and that no rape technically took place, she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions were.<br /><br />The movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents. As it goes on, Marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasn't become as unhinged as her nemesis. Fawcett does a creditable enough job, while Russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on screen for much of the running time, the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young doesn't shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation; the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times. And by the time Marjorie has the upper hand, things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood, and one hopes that Pat can make her see reason.<br /><br />""Extremities"", I felt, was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both fine in support (Scarwid has a great moment where Terry reveals herself to be a rape victim), and the pace is consistent. Granted, the dialog isn't always very sharp, but the material is compelling every step of the way.<br /><br />8/10",1,riveting drama  scripted by william mastrosimone based on his stage play  in which farrah fawcett plays marjorie  attacked in her car by rapist joe  james russo   she manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do  she realizes  however  that joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives  when her housemates pat  alfre woodard  and terry  diana scarwid  are off at work  joe pays her a visit to finish what he started  after joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways  she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him  knowing full well shes in another  his word against yours  situation and that no rape technically took place  she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to pat and terry what his intentions were  the movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents  as it goes on  marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasnt become as unhinged as her nemesis  fawcett does a creditable enough job  while russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation  with only two characters on screen for much of the running time  the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage  director robert m  young doesnt shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation  the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times  and by the time marjorie has the upper hand  things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood  and one hopes that pat can make her see reason   extremities   i felt  was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity  woodard and scarwid are both fine in support  scarwid has a great moment where terry reveals herself to be a rape victim   and the pace is consistent  granted  the dialog isnt always very sharp  but the material is compelling every step of the way  8 10

"For what it is, this is a pretty good movie. I like both Johns -Stamos (""Full House"")& Stockwell (""Christine"", ""Top Gun""). They both give strong performances. The love interest is OK, but this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I hated seeing them paint over the ""14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer"" with good old Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in WWII. I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! The movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere, with good riding action sequences. I love looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, I guess). I wouldn't give it a 10, but I did give it an 8. I do not weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were big-budget, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie.

"For everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.<br /><br />That's because Sasha, like each superhero, takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. While on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.<br /><br />As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics. It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's all over. But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action. What is more important here is the outcome of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The score is very scarce, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.<br /><br />Is the film worth it? That is a question really difficult to answer. I don't think that this experience enriched me so very much, but somehow I keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. Mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope. After all they're young people, who have all their lives to live.

"Adolf Hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the U.S. War Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the Armed Forces during World War II. Hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived, starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding to the European heartland, then moving on to the 'World Island' consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the Americas and the World.<br /><br />In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription, as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. Grade school children sang his praises, and young German boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. Marching unopposed into Austria in 1938, Hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was stunned to learn that Germany signed a non-aggression pact with it's mortal enemy Russia, a ploy to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately after, Germany invaded Poland, bringing Hitler's conquest right to Russia's doorstep. He would deal with her later.<br /><br />It was during this period that Britain still declined to oppose Hitler's thrust across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous declaration stating 'Peace in Our Time'. It didn't turn out that way.<br /><br />The most fascinating information to be learned in this installment, at least to me, was provided by a small snippet of footage from a German pro Hitler rally in the mid '30's. It was led by a German American taking his cue directly from the homeland.

"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Juggernaut is a British made ""thriller"" released in the US by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to retreat to France and start up a medical practice. He is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows Karloff needs the money.<br /><br />Karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband. All the while, the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed. When he spills the beans to the wife, she goes berserk and even bites the son's hand.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse has misplaced the hypo Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff finds out he isn't getting any money, he asks the wife to poison the son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. Analysis shows poison, but not quite in time as Karloff kidnaps the nurse.<br /><br />To make a long story short, the nurse escapes, gets the police, and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by Karloff. Karloff instead injects himself and dies.<br /><br />This movie does have some good points. Karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in The Devil Commands and the Man Who Lived Again. It is peculiar, however, to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over. We never find out why he is walking this way. I suspect the director thought it made him more sinister.<br /><br />The actress playing the 2-timing wife overacts something terrible. She has a French accent. Even though she overacts badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting...).<br /><br />A little below average for a Karloff vehicle.

"This movie could be used in film classes in a ""How Not to Script a B-Movie"" course. There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie: Budgets are tight, Time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. Scarecrow's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but I'll just mention one: The Gravedigger. The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. Why give the Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a boyfriend? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? Scarecrow doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />The ""story"" of Scarecrow goes something like this: Lester is a high school kid (played by and actor who'd I'd peg to be in his early 30's) who is picked on by the other kids. He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named Judy. His mom is a lush and the town whore. One of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings (by calling him a ""faggot"" for drawing birds instead of ""monsters and cowboys."" If you have a high school student still drawing cowboys I'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows) and later, kills Lester, in a cornfield, under the titular scarecrow. Magically, Lester's soul goes into the scarecrow. Somehow, this transference changes Lester's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast (I know some reviews have called the scarecrow a Kung-Fu scarecrow. I disagree. The scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie). The scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him, those who smoke pot in the corn field, those who dig graves, boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers, pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.<br /><br />The bonus feature on the DVD should be mentioned. The director (a Frenchman) does an impromptu version of rap music, admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by (and I'm paraphrasing): ""Life ez a bitch, but et has a great ass""<br /><br />Number of Beers I drank while watching this movie: 5 Did it help: No Number of Beers needed to enjoy this movie: Whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level.",0,this movie could be used in film classes in a  how not to script a b movie  course  there are inherent constrictions in a b movie  budgets are tight  time is precious  scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days  and the actors are often green and inexperienced  the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you  scarecrows script seems to have been written in a drunken haze  i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie  but ill just mention one  the gravedigger  the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie  he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie  he is shown with his daughter  who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie  the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count  why give the gravedigger a daughter  why give the daughter a boyfriend  why introduce them so late in the movie  why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline  scarecrow doesnt seem to care  the  story  of scarecrow goes something like this  lester is a high school kid  played by and actor whod id peg to be in his early 30s  who is picked on by the other kids  he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy  his mom is a lush and the town whore  one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings  by calling him a  faggot  for drawing birds instead of  monsters and cowboys   if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys id think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows  and later  kills lester  in a cornfield  under the titular scarecrow  magically  lesters soul goes into the scarecrow  somehow  this transference changes lesters soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast  i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung fu scarecrow  i disagree  the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie   the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him  those who smoke pot in the corn field  those who dig graves  boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers  pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set  the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned  the director  a frenchman  does an impromptu version of rap music  admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by  and im paraphrasing    life ez a bitch  but et has a great ass  number of beers i drank while watching this movie  5 did it help  no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie  whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level 
"Though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just as we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. An inside look at the staging of ""The Scottish Play"" as actors call ""Macbeth"" when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe. With a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying.",1,though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin  sxsw film  just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love  and elizabeth  this movie deserves an audience  an inside look at the staging of  the scottish play  as actors call  macbeth  when producing it to avoid the curse  this is a crisp  efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe  with a wonderfully evocative score  and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest  this is a quiet gem  not world class  but totally satisfying 
"As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud ""dramatic"" score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see, otherwise skip it.",0,as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1 2 hour  however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw  who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene shes in  connery is fine as is fishbourne  but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality  and the ending is simply bizarre  the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner  so to compensate they added an overloud  dramatic  score  every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration  to the point where it becomes laughable  if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see  otherwise skip it 
"Poor Ivy: Though to the manner born, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges, this uncertain status vexes her unduly. The Gretorexes (for so they are called) don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him. Luckily, one of the beaux she still strings along (Patric Knowles) is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison, with which she bids her hubby farewell.

"First off I'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over-the-top. A toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would've made this movie much less cheesy. But overall I think it's one of the better B-movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Though this movie is missing the all-important nude factor, there are several other movies at which to view her. But here she gets all evil-hotness, especially towards the end as she's walking away from the engulfed scarecrow. Also Richard Elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend. Yes it's a low budget B-movie. But out of all of them I've seen, this is definitely one of my very top favorites.",1,first off ill be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over the top  a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow wouldve made this movie much less cheesy  but overall i think its one of the better b movies  tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful  not to mention incredibly beautiful  though this movie is missing the all important nude factor  there are several other movies at which to view her  but here she gets all evil hotness  especially towards the end as shes walking away from the engulfed scarecrow  also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend  yes its a low budget b movie  but out of all of them ive seen  this is definitely one of my very top favorites 
"Despite the excellent cast, this is an unremarkable film, especially from the aviation perspective. It may be somewhat better than the egregious ""von Richthofen and Brown"" but not by much. ""Blue Max"" remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while ""Darling Lilli"" is fun if not taken seriously. It's interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new, high-quality WW I aero film.",0,despite the excellent cast  this is an unremarkable film  especially from the aviation perspective  it may be somewhat better than the egregious  von richthofen and brown  but not by much   blue max  remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while  darling lilli  is fun if not taken seriously  its interesting to speculate what ilm could do with zeppelins and gothas in a new  high quality ww i aero film 
"Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why I'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of Full Moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em' this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off an A-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.",1,doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar  but is totally worthwhile  it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s  which is why id have loved to see follow up movies    but judging by the rest of full moons output there simply werent enough tits to satisfy the typical audience  unfortunately  thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience   which is unfortunate  because without em this could have been a harry potter style magicfest that kids would have eaten up  both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great   i wasnt sure if ms  nipar hadnt wandered off an a list picture onto this film  she was very believable  no  seriously  anyway   its a shame they didnt have the bucks to license dr  strange  because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom 
"Following my experience of Finland for slightly more than a week, I'd say this movie depicts the nature of the Finnish society very accurately. Especially the young-couple-with-a-baby-having-serious-issues phenomenon is very familiar to me, as I witnessed the exact same thing in person when I was in Finland. The relationships and problems of people, fragility of the marriage institution, the drinking culture, unemployment and the ascending money problem, all are very well put, without any subjectivity or exaggeration.<br /><br />There are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other, but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding. Not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound, but as said above, the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of ""real life"" and captivate the viewer. I happen to think in a calm moment: What is happening in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, this is what is happening. Movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power. It would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries, but it particularly reflects Finland as it is, and pretty damn well.<br /><br />One comment about the acting: Being the fan of Finnish cinema I am, I've never seen any of these actors on any other movie, but I found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good try by the entire crew. I'll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast..<br /><br />7,5 / 10",1,following my experience of finland for slightly more than a week  id say this movie depicts the nature of the finnish society very accurately  especially the young couple with a baby having serious issues phenomenon is very familiar to me  as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in finland  the relationships and problems of people  fragility of the marriage institution  the drinking culture  unemployment and the ascending money problem  all are very well put  without any subjectivity or exaggeration  there are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other  but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding  not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound  but as said above  the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of  real life  and captivate the viewer  i happen to think in a calm moment  what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street  well  this is what is happening  movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power  it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries  but it particularly reflects finland as it is  and pretty damn well  one comment about the acting  being the fan of finnish cinema i am  ive never seen any of these actors on any other movie  but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall  maybe not a masterpiece  but a very good try by the entire crew  ill be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast   7 5   10
"urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good plot and good casting. i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible. I lost the will to live halfway through. The only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was Rose Byrne (who was the reason for me watching it in the first place). She did a good job as Rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13. it was a fantastic first effort in a movie. the dog was also very good. both did a great job with such awful material. Sandra Bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie. she was completely miscast, and i don't think she ever quite got the character.<br /><br />I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and thats only because of Rose.",0,urgh  3 things a movie needs  a good script  a good plot and good casting  i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible  i lost the will to live halfway through  the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was rose byrne  who was the reason for me watching it in the first place   she did a good job as rastus and her appearance hasnt changed much since she was 13  it was a fantastic first effort in a movie  the dog was also very good  both did a great job with such awful material  sandra bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie  she was completely miscast  and i dont think she ever quite got the character  i give the movie 2 out of 10   and thats only because of rose 
"This movie was absolute torture. First of all, it's a whopping 4+ hours long! True, the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for, but every single one of those battles need not have been shown. So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial film as advertised. Sure didn't seem like it, as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border. Each battle was the exact same as the previous. It was so predictable. (This might be a spoiler.) The whole army marches uphill, five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same cussword every time), one of the lead actors is shot, someone yells for a stretcher, the actor says, ""No, don't get a stretcher. That will take 6 men from the battalion,"" and then an actor dies. That exact same thing happens over and over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long movie, none of the characters were well developed. The actresses had the most miniscule roles. They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were weeping synchronized. It was so comical. They moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together.<br /><br />The list just goes on and on. I know I'm still forgetting something .

"I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken until I watched the film. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and overall a bad film. Please don't watch this film. Rent the original ""War Games"" if you are feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />I didn't like the bending of the plot to beat-the-terrorist-threat idea either. In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the U.S.A. In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat.

"Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful, it's terrible.<br /><br />I wouldn't have minded if this had been an animated series- would've been better that way I guess, but as a live-action show, it typifies the terms 'cheesy' and 'campy'. Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi- coloured, spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills. The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear. The acting is woeful, and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch, it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme, look as equally as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement in itself. In fact, they look as if they are jumping and dancing about; like it was some version of the 'Nutcracker', or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. Besides, there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly.<br /><br />Kids show or not, this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity. And even though this version is set in America, you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US, but rather in Japan; thus the somewhat 'fake' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version-only to be juxtaposed onto the US version.<br /><br />If you like this type of thing, then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent.",0,very rarely do i give less rave reviews on a show or film i dislike on imdb  but mighty morphin power rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful  its terrible  i wouldnt have minded if this had been an animated series  wouldve been better that way i guess  but as a live action show  it typifies the terms cheesy and campy  of which power rangers is  five multi  coloured  spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills  the costumes are horrid  they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear  the acting is woeful  and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch  it makes jean  claude van damme  look as equally as good as bruce lee  which is an understatement in itself  in fact  they look as if they are jumping and dancing about  like it was some version of the nutcracker  or they were doing ballet  rather than fighting  besides  there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly  kids show or not  this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity  and even though this version is set in america  you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us  but rather in japan  thus the somewhat fake fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese version only to be juxtaposed onto the us version  if you like this type of thing  then stick with sentai  the japanese equivalent 
"ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally Mark's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life. During the 60 ' and 70' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. One of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from. I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students. This society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark 's inner wish for it but , his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said, A depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game.

"It really is that bad of a movie. My buddy rented it because he, well, is an idiot. But then again, I must be an idiot too because I watched the whole damn thing! The actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think that are going places. The only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at Luby's. All I could think of while I was watching this ""gem"" was how it actually got made. I mean, some ""screenwriter"" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it. Actors were cast, locations were scouted, make-up artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of Al Collins graphic Design School were brought in and this turd started to take form.<br /><br />There obviously were a ton of things that I hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the craziest was the overuse of music. Every single minute of this flick was scored. There was not a single break in music. And at times it was mixed higher than the dialogue, not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything.<br /><br />After it was over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit then switching to a BMW 740il.

"Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park. They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick. The whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away. Why isn't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. You will also notice every close up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens).

"OK, I didn't have high expectations but this film descending into depths I could not imagine.<br /><br />The plot, as it were, involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a Sin Eater. The Sin Eater allows for Catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui. Nevermind that this makes no sense since then a Baptist could give you salvation....we'll move on.<br /><br />I'll layout the plot w/o giving much away: the priest goes to Rome with his buddy to investogate. He brings with him a mental patient (I'm not making this up) who shot him during an excorism and who loves him (not one lick of this BTW is explained), a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a Cardinal. They get to Rome, find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film, meet with a bondage gear S&M anti-pope that the drunk Irish guy knows (not explained) and who gives information by killing people (oh, BTW, he's a bad guy so he has an industrial/techno soundtrack) and then...umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot meanders about. Heath chills with the Sin Eater, flies to New York with the Sin Eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then (all off camera) the anti-pope falls and the film ends.<br /><br />About 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened.

"This film reminded me so much of ""A History of Violence"" which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble. Don't these men have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone, feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap. Funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small British town except maybe put a mans head in it.<br /><br />Sam Peckinpah who made the ""Wild Bunch"" which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared. But it was done with style, and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not believable. First of all the location is wrong and does not work. Why place it in England? I would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the American South in the 1930's or something. Second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife.<br /><br />Sam Peckinpah missed the mark on this one.",0,this film reminded me so much of  a history of violence  which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence  dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble  dont these men have a job  anyway  dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone  feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap  funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it  sam peckinpah who made the  wild bunch  which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared  but it was done with style  and you believed it  straw dogs is not believable  first of all the location is wrong and does not work  why place it in england  i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930s or something  second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife  sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one

"This review applies for the cut of the film that's generally available as ""Fury of the Wolfman"". I understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage, and I would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as ""Fury of the Wolfman"". In short, the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is utter nonsense, and incomprehensible nonsense at that.<br /><br />Waldemar Daninsky, that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by Paul Naschy in a seemingly endless series of films, is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to Tibet, where he was attacked by a yeti. Somehow this has turned him into a werewolf. Daninsky is a doctor, a scientist, and an instructor at what appears to be a college. One of his female colleagues, Ilona Elmann, is involved in a vague form of hypnosis...""Chematodes"", a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victim's head. Ellman feels this will enable her to ""change the direction of the human brain"", naturally enabling her to rule the world, provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble.<br /><br />Elmann is also into werewolves, because she kidnaps Daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory. She has a bunch of other people trapped there as well. Some of them look like gypsies, and are chained up, being in varying states of lucidity. Others are clearly hippies. Elmann feels that one day she may be able to ""help them be human again"" (?), but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes. Waldemar becomes her hairy hit man, wandering around like a werewolf zombie--that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another Naschy werewolf film, ""Frankenstein's Bloody Terror"" (don't ask), at which point Naschy's werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animal.<br /><br />Is this making any sense? No? Good. That's the film's saving grace. It doesn't try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level, it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up.

"I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors, and the director, even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case, it was a big miss. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like ""Dead Again"", I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, even though his best performance was not ""Tender Mercies"", but ""The Great Santini"". This movie was truly a big waste of time.

"""It's not like that big mechanical toy"", says a character early on, commenting on ""Jaws"". Well, ""Blood Surf"" would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the ""Jaws"" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Acting and directing are not much better, either; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but for the audience too. Saying you ""liked"" this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, further destroying the poor horror genre.

"This is a generally nice film, with good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to attempt some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone?<br /><br />The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. They pick Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to adopt? And even if they pick a girl, does it mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I guess if the writers had heard of all this, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional.<br /><br />Salman acts very well. It's nice to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is just about OK; she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta.<br /><br />The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance. She makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives the film, emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her career-best performances. There is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries. She just should do more such roles.<br /><br />The film's ending only highlights what I said above. It is tear-jerking, exciting and very well-acted. Watch it for Preity.<br /><br />7/10 for the film! 10/10 - for Preity!",1,this is a generally nice film  with good story  great actors and great songs  the cinematography was unfortunately bad  one of the films weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman  why  does it hurt to attempt some originality  abbas  mustan  anyone  the film is about a newly married couple  raj and priya  salman   rani   priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy  and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother  who will carry their child  they pick madhubala  a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta  the film is not really realistic  i mean  isnt it easier to adopt  and even if they pick a girl  does it mean the man has to sleep with her  have you heard of insemination  anyway  i guess if the writers had heard of all this  the film wouldnt have been made  so the concept is apparently intentional  salman acts very well  its nice to see him playing a serious character  but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman  come on  its cheesy and unrealistic  rani is just about ok  she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zinta  the film belongs to preity  who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance  she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally  she lives the film  emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time  partly because of her role  partly because of her magnetic and positive personality  this is one of her career best performances  there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries  she just should do more such roles  the films ending only highlights what i said above  it is tear jerking  exciting and very well acted  watch it for preity  7 10 for the film  10 10   for preity 
"This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film. The actors are all perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a different world. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough.

"I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments. It's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre. Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters' behavior often strains belief. I'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/TV/literature/life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even). Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point. It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it doesn't really pay off.",0,i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments  its not a bad movie exactly  but its one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre  plus  it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways  and the characters behavior often strains belief  id say its a film that you would get something out of if you dont have a lot of film tv literature life behind you  to be honest  ive seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even   otherwise  its point has been made before and more artfully  and that gets to the big problem  which is that it really doesnt have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point  it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling  and it doesnt really pay off 
"Even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it's still an awful film. If one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke.....first off, Jeroen Krabbé is i guess the poor man's Gerard Depardieu.....naturally i hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in the 'Iron Mask' three musketeer one. Otherwise to me he is box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The poor man's box office poison....really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised. If the '4th Man' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the Bourgeoisie....what am i saying? it isn't. Let's just say hypothetically, if it was supposed to be, it wasn't sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing....if it isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead......i think that is what happened. The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either.....(for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film....very sharp satire)<br /><br />[potential spoiler alert]<br /><br />Really, the blow job in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé's character works so so hard to attain.... do you even care? is it funny? since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control.....though i'm guessing he didn't cast Jeroen Krabbé because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass.... except he's incompetent at it. So it becomes like a weird caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose? and Jeroen Krabbé is the butt of the joke as well? I just don't see it...... So you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right? It is the worst film ever because he's supposed to be a good director. So there is some kind of dupery involved.

"Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail-boy for struggling TV station UBC (that's United Broadcasting Corporation); he is going nowhere at work, offering ridiculous projects like ""Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog"" to studio executives - because Lincoln, doctors, and dogs are popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals, but has no idea how to pick a hit TV show. His secretary Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who does double duty as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who bugs the heck out of Russell when he wants to watch TV. Turns out, the monkey watches all the popular shows, and can easily pick the hits. Russell discovers the chimp's talent, and uses him to advance his own career. Understandably, things gets HAIRY for Russell and the cast!<br /><br />Raffles the chimp (handled by Frank Lamping) performs well; Raffles does look bored and/or distracted during a few scenes, when the chimp is supposed to look interested; these could have been corrected with re-takes or editing. A mild satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit TV shows! AND, it's a monkey who gets a BEER during the commercials (drinking in a Disney film)! A look through the cast will reveal s bunch of fun TV actors to recognize and try to place. You could make a drinking game, in honor of Raffles' beer-guzzling, by guessing actors, and where you've seen them before.

"It seems Hal Hartley's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences. This film will be no exception to that rule. Fay Grim acts as a sequel to Hartley's 'Henry Foole' from 1998. The focus this time is on Henry's ex wife (played to perfection by the always welcome Parker Posey), who is being pestered by CIA goons about Henry's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings. In the interim of all of this, Fay ends up on an odyssey,dealing with international spies,etc. The film does get a bit bogged down in the second half. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is one not to be missed. For the novice Hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique, you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one (especially if you haven't seen 'Henry' yet).

"I have watched quite a few Cold Case episodes over the years, beginning with Season 1 episodes back in 2003-2004. And while most have been good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Though some may not agree with the story content (i.e. the male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit.<br /><br />The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960's named Sean Coop (aka, the cold case victim who goes by his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /><br />In the story, Coop is single, a Vietnam war vet, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time.<br /><br />The flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white, with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout. Examples include their red squad car, the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale.<br /><br />The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode. One key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected fellow officer on the force, confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, at this point, as the shame and disgrace of Coop's father was heaped upon Coop - ""You are not going to disgrace our family...and you're not my son, either."" - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same-sex relationships of that era.<br /><br />Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go at it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled ""Batman and Robin homos"". <br /><br />As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once can see the tension in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids, his church, and yet his undying devotion to Coop.<br /><br />In the end, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he cannot have both Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force.<br /><br />The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop, as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car, quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner: ""Jimmy...we were the lucky ones. Don't forget that.""<br /><br />The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett, playing the still grieving Jimmy, only much older by now, and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop.<br /><br />I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is without a doubt the most well-written, well-acted, and well done of all Cold Case episodes that I've ever seen.",1,i have watched quite a few cold case episodes over the years  beginning with season 1 episodes back in 2003 2004  and while most have been good  this particular episode was not only the best of the best  but has few rivals in the emmy categories  though some may not agree with the story content  i e  the male to male romantic relationship   i doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit  the story is essentially about a case that was reopened  based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer  the two central actors are two police officers in the 1960s named sean coop  aka  the cold case victim who goes by his last name  coop  and his partner  jimmy bruno   in the story  coop is single  a vietnam war vet  with a deeply troubled past  jimmy  however  is married  with children no less  both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship  but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time  the flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white  with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout  examples include their red squad car  the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in jimmys bedroom  where jimmys wife watched coop and jimmy drink  fight  and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol induced state  i found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes  with everything else in black and white  i still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale  the clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode  one key emotional scene was when coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of jimmys baby  in this scene  coops father  sarge  who was a respected fellow officer on the force  confronts coop about the rumors surrounding coops relationship with jimmy  one can feel sorry for coop  at this point  as the shame and disgrace of coops father was heaped upon coop    you are not going to disgrace our family   and youre not my son  either     clearly indicative of the hostile views of same sex relationships of that era  additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where coop and another officer go at it after coop and jimmy are labeled  batman and robin homos    as for the relationship between coop and jimmy  its obvious that coop wanted more of jimmy in his life  once can see the tension in jimmys face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids  his church  and yet his undying devotion to coop  in the end  jimmy walks away from coop  realizing that he cannot have both coop and his family at the same time  sadly  coop is killed  perhaps because of his relationship with jimmy  but coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force  the most moving scene in the whole episode was when coop  as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car  quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner   jimmy   we were the lucky ones  dont forget that   the soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode  i enjoyed the final scene with the actor chad everett  playing the still grieving jimmy  only much older by now  and clearly still missing his former partner  coop  i highly recommend this episode and consider it the best  it is without a doubt the most well written  well acted  and well done of all cold case episodes that ive ever seen

"Guy Ritchie's noble effort is beat up, knocked down, raped, kicked around, shot, stabbed, spit upon, punched, sodomized, and abused and left for dead by Madonna's dreadful performance. Her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this, and if you exclude ALL of the scenes that his wife was in, it's a fair movie at best.

Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the C-list (i don't even dare call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is the worst movie I have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.<br /><br />So, just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no, you really don't as you run in the opposite direction.",0,i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie  however this was an unique case  this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted  needless to say i was brutally disappointed  set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation  this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing  first  there are gaping plot holes  second  very few of the c list  i dont even dare call them b  actors can act worth a damn  so any scenes that have potential fail miserably  third  the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult  leading to very few surprises for the audience  fourth and most importantly  the ending is completely anti climatic partially because of how it ends  setting who the killer turns out to be  and partially because the dialog is just atrocious  to the films credit  it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene  and ive seen a lot  so  just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing  the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no  you really dont as you run in the opposite direction 
"Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).<br /><br />Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream.

"So this is what actress Kim Basinger has succumbed to? Mmm to tell the truth the film's title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic, but simplicity can have its strengths. Anyhow by the end of 'While She Was Out' I was left feeling rather indifferent. Not the worse (despite being engulfed by negatives), but there's easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm, but compact and unbalanced late-night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid, when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park.<br /><br />The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material (taken from a short story), along with the very variable performances. The flimsy script was poorly thought-out (which isn't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off), so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. As for the bunch of stereotypical goons (led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon) terrorizing Basinger, well they were less than threatening, but hopelessly clueless. Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand (don't ask me why?) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn't elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up. Basinger's performance is stout-like, but doesn't craft much empathy. Craig Sheffer shows up as her hot-headed husband. Strangely I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic (why would she be constantly carrying it) and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing. Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty, due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead.<br /><br />Susan Montford's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy, as it pretty much chugs along. I liked the opening credits though, with its hauntingly sullen score (which is the most effective thing throughout the feature) and polished photography.<br /><br />No great shakes. Doesn't ask much of your time, but I wouldn't care to see it again.

"Before I explain the ""Alias"" comment let me say that ""The Desert Trail"" is bad even by the standards of westerns staring The Three Stooges. In fact it features Carmen Laroux as semi- bad girl Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short ""Saved by the Belle"". <br /><br />In ""The Desert Trail"" John Wayne gets to play the Moe Howard character and Eddy Chandler gets to play Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is Moe hitting Curly. Wayne's character, a skirt chasing bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy. <br /><br />Playing a traveling rodeo cowboy Wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good-the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar (actually even less after Wayne robs the box office). No explanation is given for Wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl. <br /><br />Things get complicated at this point because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his sidekick Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix-who would go on to play Sheriff Micah on television's ""The Rifleman"") see Wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly get blamed. <br /><br />So Moe and Curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to Smith and Jones. Who do they meet first but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest (Senorita Rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie). <br /><br />Larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman (now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of Hal Roach's ""Our Gang"" shorts). Kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than any others in the production, as if they used an entirely different crew to film them. <br /><br />Even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad. The two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. Both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different, and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. There is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even remotely convincing. <br /><br />One thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and ride away (to screen right) from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. The cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. Outside of home movies I have never seen anything like this, not because it is looks stupid (which it does) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. They would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. Or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know?

"Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity, and globalization through the making and tossing of beads. I saw this film at the International Film Festival of Boston, and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both China and the United States. The eye-opening film is humorous, in-depth, serious, non-patronizing, and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role. It is worth comparing to Murderball -- it's simply that well done. The young women workers in China have various points of view, and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline. The revelers during Carnival are the highlight, but only because this excellent film provides in-depth context inside the factory in China without narration. Bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film! I would have never thought about the connection between beads, China, and New Orleans; now I think about the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality, and fun. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film, unlike other films on globalization that I've seen.",1,mardi gras  made in china provides a wonderful  intricate connection between popular culture  nudity  and globalization through the making and tossing of beads  i saw this film at the international film festival of boston  and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization  but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states  the eye opening film is humorous  in depth  serious  non patronizing  and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role  it is worth comparing to murderball    its simply that well done  the young women workers in china have various points of view  and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline  the revelers during carnival are the highlight  but only because this excellent film provides in depth context inside the factory in china without narration  bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film  i would have never thought about the connection between beads  china  and new orleans  now i think about the human connection between almost every object  but also the role of globalization  inequality  and fun  more importantly  i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film  unlike other films on globalization that ive seen

"It's got Christopher Lee, it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen, it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises, it's got volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax the entire planet blows up. How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly, mind-numbingly DULL? The answer, my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots, most of them involving long tracks, pans, or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting in cars and driving... I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering ""Say something, please somebody, just say something... DO something... anything!...""<br /><br />The dialogue, when it does come, is terrible.<br /><br />""Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours."" was a typically meaningless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage, justified in this speech from Lee as the head alien:<br /><br />""The planet Earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe. All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!"" <br /><br />This is is Neanderthal SF script writing. This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds. It is, and I collect such things, the most god-awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired.

"Mardi Gras: Made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but, are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another. David Redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in America for up to 20 dollars. When Redmon questions Americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded. When he told them that they are made in China for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, Americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little remorseful but didn't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth. When Redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that Americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads. The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it. This movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own.<br /><br />M.

"I guess I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film. Is it one of the best of the ""Nightmare"" series? Maybe not, but I had lots of fun with it. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential. Since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down, I felt this so-called final installment (""New Nightmare"" is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump. There are some great nightmare sequences, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which Freddy controls. This is both a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape, hopping around like Super Mario. And Freddy belts out the funny one-liner, ""Great graphics."" And since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove. <br /><br />The cast is superb. Lisa Zane is perfectly cast in the lead. I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since ""The Running Man,"" and I think the last time I saw that film was about 5 years ago. He's another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence. And who can forget the cameos? The best one is by Johnny Depp (from the first ""Nightmare"") playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial. <br /><br />The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome! So for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on DVD! Hopefully all the editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has the 3D element removed. <br /><br />I personally didn't see many things wrong with the film. It even elaborated on Freddy's backstory. The film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the gross-out effects are terrific. Could this have given better justice to the franchise? Of course it could have. But Rachel Talalay did a fine job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.<br /><br />And in closing, I loved the montage over the opening credits. Fans of the series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy. <br /><br />My score: 7 (out of 10)",1,i guess im part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film  is it one of the best of the  nightmare  series  maybe not  but i had lots of fun with it  freddy krueger reaches his evil  wisecracking potential  since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down  i felt this so called final installment   new nightmare  is the real finale  brought the series out of its slump  there are some great nightmare sequences  including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed  falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls  this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence  especially when we see him out of the dreamscape  hopping around like super mario  and freddy belts out the funny one liner   great graphics   and since the movie was made about 10 years ago  it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove  anyone who remembers the first 8 bit nintendo remembers the powerglove   the cast is superb  lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead  i havent seen yaphet kotto since  the running man   and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago  hes another great  underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence  and who can forget the cameos  the best one is by johnny depp  from the first  nightmare   playing a spokesman for an anti drug commercial   the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome  so for those who are looking to check this film out  please rent or buy it on dvd  hopefully all the editions come with the 3d glasses  but im sure the video edition has the 3d element removed   i personally didnt see many things wrong with the film  it even elaborated on freddys backstory  the film is a great mix of humor and scares  and the gross out effects are terrific  could this have given better justice to the franchise  of course it could have  but rachel talalay did a fine job  and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done  and in closing  i loved the montage over the opening credits  fans of the series will be delighted  and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy   my score  7  out of 10 
"The unflappable William Powell. He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world. He always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him. The murders are projects, barely human beings. I have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit. Other than an occasional weeping widow, the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists. Nothing more.

"This ambitious film suffers most from writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's delusions of grandeur. Highly derivative of much better material (Altman's ""Nashville,"" Lumet's ""Network""), this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere. A couple of misguided detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) don't help matters. Neither does the uneven level of performances. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing angst. And how many times must we see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick (""Chicago"" and ""The Hours"" will suffice)? Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing. Speaking of foul mouths, the script was so loaded with ""F"" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. Don't even talk about that awful soundtrack, full of insipid and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann. Her extended rendition of ""One,"" a maudlin number to begin with, drove me to distraction at the start of the film. I should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours, by which time I'd been pushed to the brink of hell. One redeeming feature, which I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the bunch, by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged coke fiend bent on self-destruction. Her credibility exceeded all others by far.

"What's written on the poster is: ""At birth he was given 6 years to live... At 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime."" Ami is an American-born Israeli who was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy disease at the age of one. At age of 34, after the love toward his 22 years old care-giver didn't go well, he decided to come to the US to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, and weights 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, even I have seen this film.<br /><br />Obviously it's courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger, but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history, people with his disease won't live long. What's the point of him showing up at old doctor's door for? Why is tracking down this old doctor in the US is a journey of his lifetime? There are so many things we might be interested in Ami's life: how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger? How can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others? How did he out lived his doctor's prediction? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature? The movie told us none of that. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let Ami to show up at his old doctor's door in order to show him that he is still alive.

"When a man who doesn't have Alzheimer's can't remember how many films he's made, he probably is the world's most prolific director after all. That man is Jesus Franco, the king of so-called 'eurotrash'. His 1980 flick Devil Hunter is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the film's title is misleading, for starters) as any other Franco film I've seen. That makes it sound pretty awful, and it is... Yet Franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made. The mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious.<br /><br />Devil Hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour. The kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in South America. There's lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole. You need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away, as these are Franco's main methods of extending a film out to feature length.<br /><br />The monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary. He has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. Early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens here but I think he ate her stomach (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!).<br /><br />Anyway, the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out Vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers. The flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half Brooklyn-American, half English-Liverpudlian and all retarded. All of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.<br /><br />Not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape. The nebulous action is fleshed out (haha!) by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself. That he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but it's gotta be done at some point, and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera.<br /><br />The best feature of Devil Hunter is the location filming. Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making, but he doesn't muck around with sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. This is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy CGI sets and backdrops ad nauseam.<br /><br />Ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot. If you're trying to see all the Video Nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and you'll be made as restless as I was. If you like Franco, you'll watch this anyway. If you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are you'll never come across this film. Copies of it aren't just lying around, and I could hardly recommend the seeking out of it.

"I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There's a lot of humor and some romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a great script, and the directing and performances are top notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre --- I'd put it up against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy.

"When this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline ""Dirty Harry is at it again"". Whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it's complete and total accuracy. ""Sudden Impact"" retains all the aspects that made the previous three Dirty Harry movies so successful- tight pacing, a compelling plot, strong supporting characters, endless gunplay, and bone-dry humor. Some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest, bloodiest, and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat intriguing: after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums, Inspector Callahan is sent on a forced ""vacation"" by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of San Paolo. He is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his (no doubt considerable) misery by a second shot to the head. Early on in the film, the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier. This incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback, snippets of which recur before each new murder. As more bodies start to appear with the same M.O, it becomes clear to Harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest (guess who?) know more than they are telling. To make matters even more complicated, the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard.<br /><br />""Sudden Impact"" offers relentless action from beginning to end. Clint Eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax. Sondra Locke's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character. That having been said, it is fair to wonder if another actress (who was not Eastwood's off-screen companion at the time) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- Theresa Russell and Cybill Shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates. Members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include Albert Popwell as Harry's partner Horace, Paul Drake as the psychopathic Mick, and the truly scene-stealing Audrie J. Neenan who portrays the vicious Ray Parkins. <br /><br />However the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots (the animosity between Harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums, a Mob vendetta against him) take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story. Their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels. In the first half of the film it sometimes appears that Dirty Harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom. However the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between Callahan, Spencer, and her former tormentors assumes prominence. This second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given ""Sudden Impact"" the potential to be a first-class, neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough .44 magnum heroics to satisfy the Harry loyalists. Instead we get the film that Eastwood and Warner Bros. clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical Eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it's intended audience. <br /><br />This was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why. Though not the film that it could have been, this is still big, trigger-happy fun.

"A young woman who is a successful model, and is also engaged to be married, and who has twice attempted suicide in the past, is chosen by a secretive and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next ""sentinel"" to the gateway to Hell, which apparently goes through a creepy old, but well maintained Brooklyn apartment building. Its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves, but apparently can't escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way.

Colin Friels is also good, and, for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni's child, and Michael Caton (best known for THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Also interestingly, Hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS, and Caton is the host of property-type programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc...)

"I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as ""Away from Her"" - or even ""The Bucket List"" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene!<br /><br />This isn't a ""feel good"" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel.",1,i saw the movie recently and really liked it  i surprised myself and cried  this movie is in the same niche genre as  away from her    or even  the bucket list  but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity  its really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar  the director does a masterful job with the challenge  hagars hard to understand  her world has hard edges and she isnt a warm endearing woman at all  the first scene gets this across without any compromise  hagar  ellen burnstyn  is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter in law  she figures it out en route and freaks out  her edges are really hard  she is mean  she is belittling and selfish  she is a stone  i didnt like her   not even a little bit  throughout the course of the movie  we get insight  we find out why she doesnt like petunias  why she favors one son over the other  how her losses have formed her character    i started to see the angel    and i started to like her  i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack  ellen burnstyn  you are a brilliant actor  kudos  kudos  kudos  what a scene  this isnt a  feel good  movie  but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy  i understand more clearly that hard edges in a persons life are there to protect  they are there for a reason    hagar isnt my mother   she isnt even my mother in law or neighbor    but parts of her are present in many women  and men  in my life  those parts somehow make more sense to me now that ive watched the stone angel 
"I thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for. Though it has its confusing parts of the plot, it doesn't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie. That being said, If you're not open to more liberal political ideas, then this probably isn't the movie for you. I thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding. Each character has their funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival was laughing throughout the whole thing. I thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area, but that's intentionally done. John Cusack is right in that although it's set in the future, it really makes you see the present.",1,i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for  though it has its confusing parts of the plot  it doesnt greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie  that being said  if youre not open to more liberal political ideas  then this probably isnt the movie for you  i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding  each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing  i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area  but thats intentionally done  john cusack is right in that although its set in the future  it really makes you see the present 
Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for Christmas. He then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for Christmas cheer. I have not been a Ben Affleck fan in the past (though I did like Daredevil and Paycheck) but here he is well cast in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter in the family who can't stand Affleck's character at first. Sure you can see where this movie is going but you don't care. Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of Christmas movies.,1,surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released  ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas  he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer  i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past  though i did like daredevil and paycheck  but here he is well cast in this role  i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who cant stand afflecks character at first  sure you can see where this movie is going but you dont care  ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies

"I came across this film by accident when listing all the films I wanted my sister to record for me whilst I was on holiday and I am so glad that I included this one. It deals with issues that most directors shy away from, my only problem with this film is that it was made for TV so I couldn't buy a copy for my friend!<br /><br />It's a touching story about how people with eating disorders don't necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies. It brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of.",1,i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one  it deals with issues that most directors shy away from  my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldnt buy a copy for my friend  its a touching story about how people with eating disorders dont necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies  it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight  it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of 
"I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity. (For one, if Stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there's no need to carry any gear, but I guess those dangling carabiners look sorta ""mountain climby,"" so let's throw them in). For those lobotomized folks who think that Colorado looks anything like the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), well the Hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.",0,i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor  and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity   for one  if stallone is out free climbing by himself  theres no need to carry any gear  but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta  mountain climby   so lets throw them in   for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy  where the movie was filmed   well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous   foul smelling stuff for you to swallow 
"The 12th animated Disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. Even though a little dated, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics.<br /><br />It's not among Disney's top works, but is satisfying. One of Disney's most ""simple"" works, yes, but keeps a certain magic and enchantment (which old Disney is well known for). This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this was a failure, there wouldn't be any more Disney animated classics.<br /><br />""Cinderella"" is somehow like a return to Disney's 1st animated classic (""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"") because it brings back the fairy tale genre. It's not clear where the story takes place, but I suppose it's somewhere in France because this is based in a tale by Charles Perrault.<br /><br />There are plenty of likable characters, such as Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy Godmother (for a fairy she sure is funny), the birds, the King and the Grand Duke.<br /><br />Jaques is very smart and amusing. I love his voice. Really has that mouse-like quality. Gus might not be that smart, but he's humorous.<br /><br />The King is hilarious, but I think that what makes him so funny is his short temper. The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too. They're two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments.<br /><br />The Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip from ""Sleeping Beauty"" was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar-looking.<br /><br />On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) aren't much better than her. However, the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, pretty and lovable. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the Fairy Godmother.<br /><br />Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. The way he walks, sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. Ironically he's very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat. Yet, there's nothing annoying about him.<br /><br />The soundtrack is simple but pleasant, although not among Disney's best. The best song in this movie is ""Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo"".<br /><br />There are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten.<br /><br />Despite being simple-looking, the movie has good artwork, as well as its nice details, although never something ""out-of-this-world"". However, the King's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.",1,the 12th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story  even though a little dated  it deserves a place in the list of disney classics  its not among disneys top works  but is satisfying  one of disneys most  simple  works  yes  but keeps a certain magic and enchantment  which old disney is well known for   this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation  if this was a failure  there wouldnt be any more disney animated classics   cinderella  is somehow like a return to disneys 1st animated classic   snow white and the seven dwarfs   because it brings back the fairy tale genre  its not clear where the story takes place  but i suppose its somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles perrault  there are plenty of likable characters  such as cinderella  the prince  bruno  the dog   jaques and gus  the two main mice   the fairy godmother  for a fairy she sure is funny   the birds  the king and the grand duke  jaques is very smart and amusing  i love his voice  really has that mouse like quality  gus might not be that smart  but hes humorous  the king is hilarious  but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper  the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too  theyre two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments  the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney  no doubt that prince philip from  sleeping beauty  was inspired on this prince  because they are very similar looking  on the other hand  lady tremaine  the stepmother  isnt supposed to be likable because shes cold  jealous  bitter and cruel  her daughters  anastacia and drizella  arent much better than her  however  the stepmother isnt as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters  cinderella  the main character  has nothing to do with them  cinderella is gentle  kind  pretty and lovable  by the way  i think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the fairy godmother  lucifer  the cat  is hilariously malicious  the way he walks  sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny  ironically hes very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality  he always agrees with the stepmothers attitudes towards cinderella  lucifer has the right name for him because hes such a devilish and mean cat  yet  theres nothing annoying about him  the soundtrack is simple but pleasant  although not among disneys best  the best song in this movie is  bibiddi bobiddi boo   there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this  such as james macdonald  marion darlington  eleanor audley  verna felton and luis van rooten  despite being simple looking  the movie has good artwork  as well as its nice details  although never something  out of this world   however  the kings palace is a spectacular masterpiece  being truly majestic and colossal 
"Hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day, you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot, though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well (what is he doing still making these movies anyway? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie?). It was a pretty fun premise -- a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon -- but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length, and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or, Abbott and Costello if that's your thing) -- basically just bad puns. Still, I found this movie fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons.

"This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A wealthy upper class English woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind. There's a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. But naturally there's a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.<br /><br />The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that.",0,this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day  a wealthy upper class english woman schemes  plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction  she uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti social kind  theres a clever sex role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters  but naturally theres a tall  dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest  and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man  the wishy washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme  but those who thirst for romance will overlook that

Especially I like all those flawless superheroes from LotR being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied.

"Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. His juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world. A lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him, and he was never completely comfortable in films. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but Askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />Askey's support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; Linden Travers going over the top as a 'mad woman'. Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who off-screen married Phyllis Calvert, as the nominal leading man, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and leading lady Carol Lynne, who turns in an equally insipid performance.

"I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this film when it came out. I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to manage that is Gigli. <br /><br />When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand. <br /><br />First off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. There's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /><br />Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would've chucked Tara Reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb, empty- headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I couldn't tell. <br /><br />Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I'd give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few movies) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk. The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb. There's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out. When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Huh? <br /><br />And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her begin to get up. <br /><br />As for the story... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone ""opens the path"" or something and all the evil monsters pop out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film) that get, quite simply, BORING. <br /><br />I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didn't laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.",0,i remember reading all the horrible  horrible reviews for this film when it came out  i meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks  the only other movie to manage that is gigli   when the movie came out on dvd  i bought it to see how awful it was  i couldnt think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible  after seeing it  i can understand   first off  let me say that this film is not without some cool shots  theres a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun  which i thought was neat  and the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at  but it gets old after the first time you see it   let me start with the worst thing in this movie  tara reid  if bad acting was a sin  then hell wouldve chucked tara reid right out since shes so unbelievably awful in this movie its unthinkable  and of all the roles  she plays a curator  now if she played a dumb  empty  headed sex toy then maybe i might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character  apparently  uwe boll didnt realize that  although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie  people would see it  he just didnt realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad  and is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping  i couldnt tell   which brings me to my next complaint  uwe boll shows off some of the worst directing skills youll ever see in a movie  i mean  id give house of the dead an f  and i only do that for very few movies  but hotd would score at least a b compared to this screwed up piece of junk  the movie starts off with a very  very long narration that causes immediate confusion  and read by a horrible narrator  and from there  the cuts are really  really dumb  theres this one point where slater and reid are looking around a building thats been destroyed and the screen blackens out  when it comes back  slater and reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly  an entire army has joined them  huh   and someone did not bother checking the mistakes in this movie  at one point  a team breaks through glass  but the glass breaks before they touch it  tara reids earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after slater walks away from a dead comrade  you can see her begin to get up   as for the story    i was really lost  something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone  opens the path  or something and all the evil monsters pop out  its just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes  the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film  that get  quite simply  boring   i bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was  i didnt laugh  but i still think its stupid  very  very  very stupid 
"Loaded with fine actors, I expected much more from ""Deceiver"" than was delivered. The plot is extremely contrived and manipulative. The many flashbacks only add to the confusion. Believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous. I would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid ""Deceiver"" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I am just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending. Blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense. - MERK",0,loaded with fine actors  i expected much more from  deceiver  than was delivered  the plot is extremely contrived and manipulative  the many flashbacks only add to the confusion  believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous  i would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid  deceiver  because you will be very frustrated  maybe i am just not hip enough to get it  but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending  blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense    merk
"Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy-lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours? <br /><br />This is exactly what Miyazaki's ""Castle in the Sky"" is all about. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail. Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it.<br /><br />As it is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers.<br /><br />""Castle in the Sky"", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming-of-age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the ""camera"" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality.<br /><br />Even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka/San or Chihiro/Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start. As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame. For that reason, I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple.<br /><br />At the same time, ""Castle in the Sky"" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.<br /><br />Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul-mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives. ""The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them...The earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet."" Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one I've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream. I have found myself near tears just listening to it.<br /><br />""Castle in the Sky"" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids. Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is.",1,have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own  with one of your closest friends at your side  facing all sorts of dangers and villains  and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization thats just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets  even if youre not quite that much of a fantasy lover  have you ever wished you could simply experience what its like to be a kid again  and not have a care in the world  for just a couple of hours   this is exactly what miyazakis  castle in the sky  is all about  pazu  a young but very brave and ambitious engineer  lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day  a girl named sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds  while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail  simply put  it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another  and i cant help but feel my worries melt away every time i see it  as it is one of miyazakis older works and takes much place in the everyday world  the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away  howls moving castle  or even princess mononoke  still  i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other  because all three of those films are  at some point or another  mystical to the point of being enigmatic  if not perplexing  especially for the youngest of viewers   castle in the sky   on the other hand  doesnt try so much to be an allegory of any kind  and its not a coming of age story either  it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a childs mind ive ever seen  not only is the artwork beautiful  but the use of perspective from the kids eyes is just amazing  whether its the panning up of the  camera  to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead  or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air  i just cant help but feel like im there with pazu and sheeta  just a kid in another world  far far away from reality  even the kids themselves dont have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like ashitaka san or chihiro haku  sheeta is pazus angel  having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day  the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start  as the film progresses  more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions  not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be  but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film  only growing stronger all the way to the last frame  for that reason  ive fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couple  at the same time   castle in the sky  is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be  youll be sure to find your fix here  mystery  action  drama  comedy  suspense  sci fi  romance  even some western   its all here  just about everything people go to the movies for  except maybe horror   this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film  its perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works  even the ending song of the film  when translated into english  conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization  and some kind of soul mate  that could not be found in our mundane lives   the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them   the earth spins  carrying you  carrying us both wholl surely meet   miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe hiasashis gorgeous scores  but this is the only one ive seen thats both a touching love song and an inspirational dream  i have found myself near tears just listening to it   castle in the sky  may not be miyazakis most developed  spectacular  or meaningful work  but its absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be  a true vision of childhood fantasy  and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids  sit back  relax  and love it for what it is 
"A recent viewing of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN. The songs aren't as good, nor is the chemistry between the characters. But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top, and then running down the steps, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing. Sinatra then croons, ""I Fall in Love Too Easily,"" before having his epiphany about whom he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone the mid-1940s?!), and the piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these.",1,a recent viewing of thats entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties  anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town  the songs arent as good  nor is the chemistry between the characters  but the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites  such as tchaikovsky  and the scene at the hollywood bowl  with sinatra and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top  and then running down the steps  while dozens of pianists play on the piano  is the best scene in the film  even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous  classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing  sinatra then croons   i fall in love too easily   before having his epiphany about whom he loves  the color is beautiful  hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution free air  can you imagine hollywood in the twenties  let alone the mid 1940s     and the piano music is absolutely glorious  mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these 
"This is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams: Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello. The connection here is the year 1940. That's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach. I'll mention the significance of the latter later on. Besides being the last time Stan and Ollie worked at the Lot of Fun, it's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like Charlie Hall and James Finlayson who appeared in most of their films. It's also the last time Art Lloyd would serve as their cameraman and Marvin Hatley-who composed their theme song which would be known as ""The Cuckoo Song (Dance of the Cuckoos)""-their score. And it would be the very last time Stan Laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film. If there is a more gag-laden structure than usual in this L & H film, it's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny. That includes most of the sound and visual effects, the latter provided by longtime Roach staffer Roy Seawright. In this one, Ollie has ""hornophobia"" from working at a noisy horn factory so Dr. Finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest. Ollie doesn't like to go boating so Stan suggests they just rent one that's docked so they wouldn't have to go anywhere. After they find one they like, we find out that convict Nick Grainger (Richard Cramer) has just escaped...I'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for L & H's longtime home as one could hope for. It's hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it. Oh, and I have a couple more lasts to mention: it's the final film appearance of both Harry Bernard, who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering Stan and Ollie as a policeman, and that of Ben Turpin, the cross-eyed comic who was born in New Orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of Baton Rouge, whose second L & H appearance this was having previously ""married"" the boys in Our Wife. The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment. All right, I mentioned 1940 being the year Stan and Ollie had their last movie released from Hal Roach Studios. It was also the first year that a comedy team, both born in the state of New Jersey, would make their first picture at what would be their home studio, Universal. The director of that movie would be the same one that guided L & H in The Flying Deuces the previous year. His name was A. Edward Sutherland. P.S. It was during this filming that script supervisor Virginia Lucille Jones had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet. That incident caused Oliver ""Babe"" Hardy to send her roses to her hospital room. They fell in love and married on March 7, 1940. It lasted until Babe's death in 1957.",1,this is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams  laurel   hardy and abbott   costello  the connection here is the year 1940  thats the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of hal roach  ill mention the significance of the latter later on  besides being the last time stan and ollie worked at the lot of fun  its also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like charlie hall and james finlayson who appeared in most of their films  its also the last time art lloyd would serve as their cameraman and marvin hatley who composed their theme song which would be known as  the cuckoo song  dance of the cuckoos   their score  and it would be the very last time stan laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film  if there is a more gag laden structure than usual in this l   h film  its nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny  that includes most of the sound and visual effects  the latter provided by longtime roach staffer roy seawright  in this one  ollie has  hornophobia  from working at a noisy horn factory so dr  finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest  ollie doesnt like to go boating so stan suggests they just rent one thats docked so they wouldnt have to go anywhere  after they find one they like  we find out that convict nick grainger  richard cramer  has just escaped   ill stop there and say this was as good a finale for l   hs longtime home as one could hope for  its hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it  oh  and i have a couple more lasts to mention  its the final film appearance of both harry bernard  who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering stan and ollie as a policeman  and that of ben turpin  the cross eyed comic who was born in new orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of baton rouge  whose second l   h appearance this was having previously  married  the boys in our wife  the latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment  all right  i mentioned 1940 being the year stan and ollie had their last movie released from hal roach studios  it was also the first year that a comedy team  both born in the state of new jersey  would make their first picture at what would be their home studio  universal  the director of that movie would be the same one that guided l   h in the flying deuces the previous year  his name was a  edward sutherland  p s  it was during this filming that script supervisor virginia lucille jones had an accident involving a rolled up carpet  that incident caused oliver  babe  hardy to send her roses to her hospital room  they fell in love and married on march 7  1940  it lasted until babes death in 1957 
"This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.",1,this is the touching story of two families in israel and the relationships within each family  each family has a gay son  the stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members  not just the two sons  the portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak 
"Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallonethat should have been enoughand featuring too many rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care ""Bostid!"" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. No deathless lines in this one. No living lines, either.",0,oh  what a bad  bad  very bad movie  cowritten by and starring sylvester stallonethat should have been enoughand featuring too many rock climbing scenes  vertigo  falling  and scene chewing villains and a botched airborne heist  there are two plots  both lame  one involves a traumatic failed rescue  and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty  and killing various harmless people whenever possible  the usually reliable john lithgow  perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product  is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesnt care  bostid   in a vague approximation of an english accent  janine turner  who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure  is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot  stallone is stolid and muscle headed  no deathless lines in this one  no living lines  either 
"This has to be some of the worst direction I've seen. The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /><br />Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with, the backdrops of Mexico, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty towns Costner rolls through on his journey for revenge. Unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big, giant head. Even the transition scenes where Costner is driving alone across Mexico quickly cut to a close-up. <br /><br />The score is over-dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been handled much better. Among other things, too many people pop up out of nowhere to help Costner along - it's just bad writing. <br /><br />It's a typical thriller storyline, but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better movie. <br /><br />The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film. This movie was never going to be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable.",0,this has to be some of the worst direction ive seen  the close up can be a very powerful shot  but when every scene consists of nothing but close ups  it loses all its impact   tony scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with  the backdrops of mexico  the cantinas  the beautiful estate where anthony quinn lives  and the dusty towns costner rolls through on his journey for revenge  unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big  giant head  even the transition scenes where costner is driving alone across mexico quickly cut to a close up   the score is over dramatic and intrusive  dictating every emotion we should feel  the story itself should have been handled much better  among other things  too many people pop up out of nowhere to help costner along   its just bad writing   its a typical thriller storyline  but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it  costners no way out had a somewhat similar storyline  but it was a much better movie   the ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film  this movie was never going to be great  but if we saw more of mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable 
"Randolph Scott is leaving the USA for the greener pastures of Canada's British Columbia. He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later Jory rustles their cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the fracas.<br /><br />From 1945 until 1962 when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good adult themed westerns, some of them considered real classics. Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns. <br /><br />It's more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. The story is downright silly at times. Williams who was along for the ride with Scott, he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time. He doesn't blame the rustlers, he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm. <br /><br />Also there's a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Tung Foo, and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They escape because Gabby's mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the Indians allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure that would have played in a Rogers film.<br /><br />Furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes on how to find gold. <br /><br />This was Gabby Hayes's farewell feature film part. It would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with Randolph Scott before this.<br /><br />I will say this, though no Caribou made any appearance in the film, this is one of the few Canadian locale films from the past that did NOT have any Mounties. <br /><br />But if I were you unless you are a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next detour off The Cariboo Trail.",0,randolph scott is leaving the usa for the greener pastures of canadas british columbia  he wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner bill williams and cook lee tung foo  they stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by victor jory  later jory rustles their cattle and williams loses his left arm during the fracas  from 1945 until 1962 when he retired  randolph scott made a series of good adult themed westerns  some of them considered real classics  unfortunately the cariboo trail will never be listed among his best westerns   its more like the material that roy rogers or gene autry might use  the story is downright silly at times  williams who was along for the ride with scott  he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time  he doesnt blame the rustlers  he blames scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm   also theres a scene in the film when scott  lee tung foo  and gabby hayes are captured by indians  they escape because gabbys mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the indians allowing our heroes to escape  im not sure that would have played in a rogers film  furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector randolph scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector gabby hayes on how to find gold   this was gabby hayess farewell feature film part  it would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with randolph scott before this  i will say this  though no caribou made any appearance in the film  this is one of the few canadian locale films from the past that did not have any mounties   but if i were you unless you are a big fan of randolph scott or gabby hayes  take the next detour off the cariboo trail

"I really enjoyed this one, and although the ending made me angry, I still give it 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are driving down to Florida, on their way they meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they really add nothing to the plot, but are at least somewhat likable. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for some fun, but they have car problems and never make it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay by the car.<br /><br />Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes. Soon she witnesses as a man (March) strangles a woman, in terror the girl flees the area, she doesn't get very far, but manages to get lost.<br /><br />Her friends by the car go looking for her, they too go into the woods and run into the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls head off, the other girl runs away, manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed.<br /><br />Eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested. This is when I started getting mad, these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don't believe them.<br /><br />They are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without getting in dangerous situations.<br /><br />This movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene imitating Psycho, graphic violence towards women and solid story. Some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will NOT like the ending, but over all, this is a great little unknown movie.",1,i really enjoyed this one  and although the ending made me angry  i still give it 10 out of 10  four college girls  baltron  kelly  stahl and cadby  are driving down to florida  on their way they meet 2 guys  turner  davis   they really add nothing to the plot  but are at least somewhat likable  the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun  but they have car problems and never make it  one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help  the other three stay by the car  soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom  being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes  soon she witnesses as a man  march  strangles a woman  in terror the girl flees the area  she doesnt get very far  but manages to get lost  her friends by the car go looking for her  they too go into the woods and run into the same man  one of them sees the dead woman  the man responds by shooting the girls head off  the other girl runs away  manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed  eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested  this is when i started getting mad  these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops dont believe them  they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell  the remaining friend manages to escape  but not without getting in dangerous situations  this movie has nudity  good actresses  a shower scene imitating psycho  graphic violence towards women and solid story  some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending  but over all  this is a great little unknown movie 
"I'm so confused. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as ""bizarre."" Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, whiny imposter's voice no less. What I also don't get is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star??? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone.",0,im so confused  ive been a huge seagal fan for 25 years  ive seen all of his films  and many of those dozens of times  i can only describe this film as  bizarre   steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film  but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines  with a thin  whiny imposters voice no less  what i also dont get is  if they had to dub some of his lines  why does his own voice appear on the rest of them  i expect seagal to age like the rest of us  but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger  confidence  bravado  charm  and sex appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies  what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky  self assured attitude and his bad ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin  where is that in your face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star    i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us   if so  his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone 
"I don't believe they made this film. Completely unnecessary. The first film was okay. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This film feels like a soap-opera. The writing is so bad, it's utterly simple. The jokes don't come across, the acting is flat, it's shot like a soap, it lacks any direction. The first film had a good emotional spine behind it. Every character had a little arc. It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film. But this time around, there is no cohesive story-line. The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. That was their one moment of creative success on this film. I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2' but please God, don't let them make a third feature installment...",0,i dont believe they made this film  completely unnecessary  the first film was okay  but there was no need for a sequel  certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film  this film feels like a soap opera  the writing is so bad  its utterly simple  the jokes dont come across  the acting is flat  its shot like a soap  it lacks any direction  the first film had a good emotional spine behind it  every character had a little arc  it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film  but this time around  there is no cohesive story line  the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens  one good thing  the brazilian boy who plays axel daeseleires son is pretty well cast  that was their one moment of creative success on this film  i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to team spirit 2 but please god  dont let them make a third feature installment   
"Who doesn't know Largo Winch in the France-Belgium-Luxemburg trio (the three countries where the French ""BD"" or ""Bandes Dessinées"" are massively published) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it HAD to be adapted on screens. After a first - and failed- attempt with a TV show, the real thing begins.<br /><br />First of all, and that's what most of the fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. Some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a 1st class-fan of the comic book, I must confess I was nicely surprised. The actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast.

"I am a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger performed at higher than average rates, I think the sets were representative of the location and the era, I liked the sound track and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and Gilley's had low ceilings--perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a ""smoke-filled bar"" hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The Camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing, the low-level of light that actually was in the bar! What a feat! Sure there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low-light shots. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was outstanding! He got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film.

"It must be the most corniest TV show on the air. This is probably a escape for Jim Belushi and all of his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use. Jim has got to retire or something. Please let them go of the air. If i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush. Id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face.

"A poorly written script with no likeable characters. As for it being a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about 2 conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them (no sex scenes) and another friend(who is semi-discustingly weird)who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates. The 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without really any romance. The 3 guys stop being friends as they separately dated her. She scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women. -- A bad movie",0,a poorly written script with no likeable characters  as for it being a comedy  i forgot to laugh  its about 2 conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them  no sex scenes  and another friend who is semi discustingly weird who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates  the 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman  amanda peet   somehow this is done without really any romance  the 3 guys stop being friends as they separately dated her  she scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women     a bad movie
"This is just about in the same league as `The Black Cat', although I'd give this a 9 rather than a 9+. That's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing!<br /><br />`The Invisible Ray' is part horror, part drama and certainly part sci-fi. For a movie made in 1936 the sci-fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. The mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend, while the acting on the part of Lugosi and Karloff couldn't be better.<br /><br />Director Lambert Hillyer captures a lot of elements that James Whale did so often. What I'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot. The scene with the gargoyles outside of Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. It's a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre.<br /><br />As with `The Black Cat' and `Island of Lost Souls', I can't understand why this film has yet to be released on DVD. When you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to DVD it's that much more puzzling.<br /><br />Anyway, watch this film if you get the chance. When it's released on DVD grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your DVD library.",1,this is just about in the same league as  the black cat  although id give this a 9 rather than a 9   thats praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing   the invisible ray is part horror  part drama and certainly part sci fi  for a movie made in 1936 the sci fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time  the mixture of horror  drama and sci fi are a perfect blend  while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldnt be better  director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often  what im saying is that this film is eerie and well shot  the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosis room is a perfect example of the mood  its a standout moment in the film  which is so sadly missing in todays movies of the genre  as with  the black cat and  island of lost souls  i cant understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd  when you consider some of the junk thats already been transferred to dvd its that much more puzzling  anyway  watch this film if you get the chance  when its released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library 
"Still love it 17 or so years after the first time I saw it, in fact I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and was very upset. Despite it's non-association with the original (which as a kid I never noticed and as an adult I don't care about), this is what cartoons *should* be like. Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone.

"Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released for years later), this is worth the watch. De Niro's role isn't huge, yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it. Any die hard De Niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today.",1,being the first feature film with robert de niro  although not released for years later   this is worth the watch  de niros role isnt huge  yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it  any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today 
"I've always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past. This presentation of ""Byron"" was unbelievable. Unbelievably bad! The script was dreadful, the acting uninspired, and all the characters woefully insipid. Apparently Byron was ""mad bad and dangerous to know"", and set the ladies hearts all-a-flutter. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked with a limp. This portrayal of the man was just limp all over.<br /><br />I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life. Not a splutter, not even a glimmer. It was utter tedium, if not downright boredom, from start to finish.<br /><br />Having the opinion that no-one will ever better the Bard of Avon, I also believe that Byron's poetry is over-revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner, and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment.<br /><br />I think the BBC lost its nous with this one",0,ive always been enthusiastic about period dramas  an art form in which the bbc has excelled in the past  this presentation of  byron  was unbelievable  unbelievably bad  the script was dreadful  the acting uninspired  and all the characters woefully insipid  apparently byron was  mad bad and dangerous to know   and set the ladies hearts all a flutter  not in this production  here he appeared as a tawdry jumped up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the greek struggle for independence  it is said that byron walked with a limp  this portrayal of the man was just limp all over  i watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life  not a splutter  not even a glimmer  it was utter tedium  if not downright boredom  from start to finish  having the opinion that no one will ever better the bard of avon  i also believe that byrons poetry is over revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner  and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment  i think the bbc lost its nous with this one

"Note that I did not say that it is better...just more enjoyable. The lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving.<br /><br />I was actually sort of surprised that this was not a Troma movie, as it has all the Troma trademarks, including spewing acidic liquids, wisecracks from the villain after every murder, a ridiculous bathtub rape scene (which is sort of hard to get upset about, since the rapist is a snowman), and dumb deputies.<br /><br />There's a lot to love: <br /><br />1. A snowman, about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet, drives a police cruiser around town.<br /><br />2. Even though it is supposed to be close to (or below) freezing, nobody's breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running.<br /><br />3. The snow reminds you more of flocking or Styrofoam peanuts than actual snow.<br /><br />4. A teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered. She talks him into breaking into the sheriff's house, of all places, in order to get it on. But first, she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine.<br /><br />5. After teen-aged Jake's head is cut off by a sled runner, his father argues with the sheriff about whether Tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. The sheriff maintains that Tommy wouldn't have been fighting with Jake because Jake ""is at least two feet taller than Tommy."" At that moment, someone in the background chimes in, ""Not anymore!"" <br /><br />6. When the evil snowman finally starts to melt away, the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period. This is much better than Tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point.<br /><br />All in all, a fun film.

"This one is tough to watch -- as an earlier reviewer says. That is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after WWII -- particularly the ""liberation"" of Dachau. It is clear that, as of the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows a ""transport"" is vivid, almost as if based upon an actual newsreel (the Nazis liked to record their atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He charts the course of a Nazi career. That charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans, at first laughing at Hitler, then incredulous, and finally helpless. That contrast, however, permits us to believe in the ""conversion"" of one young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi stance. That did happen, as witness the several attempts against Hitler, most notably the Staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out. A strong film, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicting the Nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended.",1,this one is tough to watch    as an earlier reviewer says  that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii    particularly the  liberation  of dachau  it is clear that  as of the middle of the war  we knew exactly what was happening to the jews  the sequence that shows a  transport  is vivid  almost as if based upon an actual newsreel  the nazis liked to record their atrocities   knox as the nazi is brilliant  he charts the course of a nazi career  that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans  at first laughing at hitler  then incredulous  and finally helpless  that contrast  however  permits us to believe in the  conversion  of one young nazi officer to an anti nazi stance  that did happen  as witness the several attempts against hitler  most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out  a strong film  effectively using flashbacks  accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended 
"Well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that I signed up for an IMDb account just to warn people. It is patently AWFUL!! NOTHING makes sense in this movie. There is way too many subplots for a start. Josh Hartnett's character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls (Some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work). Add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo. Harrison Ford's character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the Internal Affairs investigator's ex-wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which Ford's character calls from time to time. NONSENSE!!<br /><br />I can't remember the characters names (that's how forgettable this is) so I'll refer to them as Ford and Hartnett.<br /><br />Then there's the dialogue which is brutal. I mean cringe-inducing stuff here. Throw in every cliché in the book (having a heart-to-heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name; the duo being investigated by internal affairs (why??); hartnett confronting his dad's killer) and you've got one hell of a mess.<br /><br />As I mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non-existent: 1) When Ford's car is being repossessed, how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked? Were they following him?? 2) When Hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene (an earring) is replicated on of the charred bodies there (that was lucky!) 3) When the two are arrested and taken in for questioning - Ford keeps answering his phone and Hartnett ""centers himself"" with a yoga pose on the table. Instead of taking the phone from Ford the IA guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before Ford does. Meanwhile the female IA officer in with Hartnett is rubbing herself all over him. Then, inexplicably, the two are released without answering any questions. 4) During the car chase Hartnett's car is crashing and smashing its way around Hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again. Not a scratch! 5) When Ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at?? 6) When the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett's car, Ford is trying to close a real estate deal. Come on! 7) The bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever. His motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label? They might leave his label and it's a warning to keep his other groups loyal. But hang on, how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan?? 8) Why is the IA guy who is investigating Ford arrested in the end? There is no explication!! 9) And Hartnett gets to use his ""acting"" to capture the bad guy in the end.<br /><br />I could go on, I really could. Anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that's all it is. There's nothing else to it! It's not supposed to be satirical or ironic. It's just crap.",0,well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people  it is patently awful   nothing makes sense in this movie  there is way too many subplots for a start  josh hartnetts character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls  some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work   add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo  harrison fords character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs investigators ex wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which fords character calls from time to time  nonsense   i cant remember the characters names  thats how forgettable this is  so ill refer to them as ford and hartnett  then theres the dialogue which is brutal  i mean cringe inducing stuff here  throw in every cliché in the book  having a heart to heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name  the duo being investigated by internal affairs  why     hartnett confronting his dads killer  and youve got one hell of a mess  as i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non existent  1  when fords car is being repossessed  how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked  were they following him   2  when hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene  an earring  is replicated on of the charred bodies there  that was lucky   3  when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning   ford keeps answering his phone and hartnett  centers himself  with a yoga pose on the table  instead of taking the phone from ford the ia guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does  meanwhile the female ia officer in with hartnett is rubbing herself all over him  then  inexplicably  the two are released without answering any questions  4  during the car chase hartnetts car is crashing and smashing its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again  not a scratch  5  when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at   6  when the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnetts car  ford is trying to close a real estate deal  come on  7  the bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever  his motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label  they might leave his label and its a warning to keep his other groups loyal  but hang on  how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan   8  why is the ia guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end  there is no explication   9  and hartnett gets to use his  acting  to capture the bad guy in the end  i could go on  i really could  anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because thats all it is  theres nothing else to it  its not supposed to be satirical or ironic  its just crap 
"The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! A would-be female vampire (scantily-clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) As if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank-faced hero's kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! The languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the ""Euro-Cult"" style, as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display. Personally, the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six latter-day Luis Bunuel films) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time!",0,the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest  the intriguing plot  such as it is  seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along  a would be female vampire  scantily clad  as promised by the title  is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to feast on the blood of willing victims  who are apparently members of a suicide club  as if unsure where all of this would lead him  the writer director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank faced heros kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant     from the future  the languorous pace and dream like atmosphere  the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl  are  of course  typical of both the film maker  ditto the seashore setting at the  anti climax  and the  euro cult  style  as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display  personally  the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson  who appeared in six latter day luis bunuel films  crop up bemusedly through it from time to time 
"This really is a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their best ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I watch this over and over again. He adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would appreciate Randy and I felt a need to stand up for him.",1,this really is a great movie  some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever  but basically  all of fred and gingers movies are the same  after the singing and dancing is over  its the other characters in the movie who make the movie work  what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott  his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again  he adds to this movie  he doesnt detract from it  he has a winning personality and a great smile  randy is in my top ten all time favorites list  its great to see him as something other than a cowboy  ok  so he isnt really a great actor  but like so many other stars  errol flynn  alan ladd  victor mature  etc  he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions  all of fred and gingers movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers  otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour  i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him 
"Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler but after that the quality has dropped. Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). It had some amusing moments like the Football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of Coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'Mile' was just stupid and moronic. Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex. <br /><br />Anyway enough about the Naked Mile. I watched Beta House with apprehension as I thought it could take the series to a new low but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex jokes aplenty. Yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exuberant performance. The Greek Olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious. There are weak points though. Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first, I'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part. <br /><br />While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch but in Beta House he takes his performance to a whole new low. First and foremost he lacks charisma, a Stifler prerequisite. You really can't care less about him. The only reason I was bothered about his relationship was so Ashley could be on screen! She shines above him as does the rest of the cast. Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /><br />Saying that the film does entertain and Coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny. <br /><br />Overall this film is worth renting, get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger at Erik 'loser' Stifler.",1,now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scotts performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped  band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot  lines recycled  erik stiflers sex problem is like jims   it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the punishment of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the mile was just stupid and moronic  not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesnt want to have sex   anyway enough about the naked mile  i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised  to be honest there is no real plot but its filled with hot girls  ashley is incredible  and sex jokes aplenty  yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler  steve talley  raises the bar with an exuberant performance  the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonalds cameo is hilarious  there are weak points though  coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first  im still baffled to as how he ever got a part   while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse  john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low  first and foremost he lacks charisma  a stifler prerequisite  you really cant care less about him  the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen  she shines above him as does the rest of the cast  seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish   saying that the film does entertain and coozemans fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny   overall this film is worth renting  get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit fest event and vent your anger at erik loser stifler 
"Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Dull, bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance. Baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing. Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with. Maybe I'm expecting too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas but I sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting JJ with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie.",0,did heidijean really see this movie  a great christmas movie  not even close  dull  bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart  i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie  the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance  baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing  probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with  maybe im expecting too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie 
"You get a gift. It is exquisitely wrapped. The box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail. That is then wrapped in gorgeous paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists. The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace. It is a sight to behold.<br /><br />Then you cut the ribbon, rip off the paper, open up the box, and find...nothing. That's TOYS. You either enjoy the packaging, or forget about it.<br /><br />The film isn't without its point and purpose: War is a not a good thing. Well, isn't that original! The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. And even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. It's like someone preaching a stern, condescending sermon, only to end by saying ""Just kidding.""<br /><br />But even as an empty box, the film fails close scrutiny. Yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable, striking images. The sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the screenplay, the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal. It is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold. The film strives to be funny, in a morose sort of way, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire, tosses in his ad-lib shtick, which only seems alien to the bizarre, coldly structured world he is inhabiting. Indeed, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be. For this film to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an Oz far removed from Kansas. Every time the jokes jerk us back into reality, the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.<br /><br />It is said that this was director Barry Levinson's pet project, one that he had been striving to get made for ten years. It is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing. Like most pet projects that finally get made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: EARTH being great examples) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. Perhaps Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage. He had already perfected it to death.<br /><br />Many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy, mechanical, wind-up monstrosities. So is the film itself.",0,you get a gift  it is exquisitely wrapped  the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail  that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper  handmade and hand painted by the most talented of artists  the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace  it is a sight to behold  then you cut the ribbon  rip off the paper  open up the box  and find   nothing  thats toys  you either enjoy the packaging  or forget about it  the film isnt without its point and purpose  war is a not a good thing  well  isnt that original  the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out  and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war    war toys in particular    are clearly a bad thing  until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys  its like someone preaching a stern  condescending sermon  only to end by saying  just kidding   but even as an empty box  the film fails close scrutiny  yes  it is a sight to behold with some remarkable  striking images  the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill  but the images are cold and emotionally sterile  like the screenplay  the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal  it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things  yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold  the film strives to be funny  in a morose sort of way  but the humor is forced and artificial  robin williams  as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire  tosses in his ad lib shtick  which only seems alien to the bizarre  coldly structured world he is inhabiting  indeed  the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be  for this film to work  or make sense  it needs to be set in its own universe  an oz far removed from kansas  every time the jokes jerk us back into reality  the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham  it is said that this was director barry levinsons pet project  one that he had been striving to get made for ten years  it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing  like most pet projects that finally get made  radioland murders  radio flyer   battlefield  earth being great examples  it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmakers field of vision  perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage  he had already perfected it to death  many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy  mechanical  wind up monstrosities  so is the film itself 
"The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can't really say it's one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination, etc., but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man, even though it's bad: <br /><br />5. It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it, the only problem is in its cheesy, unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the short story on which it is based.<br /><br />4. For a cheesy horror/thriller, it is really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets, so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.<br /><br />3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of his or not, it seems as if it's impossible for Cage to play a ""normal guy"". There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into play, and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful kind of way.<br /><br />2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie, as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. ""See?"" you could write, ""this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society!"" Also, the similarities between this ""Summersisle"" society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.<br /><br />1. If you're reading this, there's probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of ""highlights"" from the movie, including Cage running around in a bear suit, and of course, the infamous ""AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!!"" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety.<br /><br />I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out, it's about a dollar per reason. It's a pretty good deal.<br /><br />NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch, and it's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue, which features a cameo from James Franco.",0,the wicker man  starring nicolas cage  is by no means a good movie  but i cant really say its one i regret watching  i could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie  like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where cage is looking for the girl  has a hallucination  followed by another hallucination  followed by a dream sequence  with a hallucination  etc   but its just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this  instead  heres five reasons why you should watch the wicker man  even though its bad   5  its hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it  the only problem is in its cheesy  unintentionally funny execution  if nothing else  this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film  or even read the short story on which it is based  4  for a cheesy horror thriller  it is really aesthetically pleasing  its pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets  so we get to see some very great scenery  there are also many nicely composed shots  it is a very good looking movie  3  nicolas cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature  whether youre a fan of his or not  it seems as if its impossible for cage to play a  normal guy   there is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays  and personally  i am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does  whether nicolas cage is great or terrible  he always brings his unique energy into play  and he is never boring to watch  he is terrible in the wicker man  but in the most wonderful kind of way  2  a student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie  as it seems to be the strongest anti feminist movie ever made   see   you could write   this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society   also  the similarities between this  summersisle  society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting  1  if youre reading this  theres probably a good chance you may have seen a youtube video that has become very popular  a collection of  highlights  from the movie  including cage running around in a bear suit  and of course  the infamous  aaghh   the bees   my eyes     line  these scenes are hilarious out of context  and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the films entirety  i bought the used dvd at blockbuster for about 5 dollars   when you work that out  its about a dollar per reason  its a pretty good deal  note  the unrated version of the movie is the best to watch  and its better to watch the theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue  which features a cameo from james franco 
"... and I DO mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen every movie ever created!), at least, obviously, among the ones, the many I know.<br /><br />5.3 ??? The rule of thumb with IMDb is this: sometimes movies rated very highly (for example, the piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called ""Oldboy"") can be truly bad. But rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6. This movie, very much worth watching, is. A disgrace.<br /><br />True, I give it a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9. It has some acting flaws (Belafonte especially), the script wanders around, sometimes. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times, the Czech Jan Kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, larger-than-life Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in an acting/poetic/moral tour de force. A pair made in Heaven! It's true that this movie, little flaws apart, does not pander to the average audiences, but those interested in watching an excellent (while, again, not beyond criticism) movie of the incomparable director who gave us ""The Shop on the Main Street"" (the best movie ever about Holocaust) should not miss this just because some silly IMDb rating system decides that ""American Beauty"" is better than ""The Angel Levine"".<br /><br />It isn't.",1,    and i do mean it  if not literally  after all  i have not seen every movie ever created    at least  obviously  among the ones  the many i know  5 3     the rule of thumb with imdb is this  sometimes movies rated very highly  for example  the piece of kannes kompetition krowned korean kraap called  oldboy   can be truly bad  but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6  this movie  very much worth watching  is  a disgrace  true  i give it a 10 in protest  the movie is not perfect  its true rating should be an 8 or a 9  it has some acting flaws  belafonte especially   the script wanders around  sometimes  however  what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times  the czech jan kadar  directing two of the greatest actors of all time  the beloved  larger than life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting poetic moral tour de force  a pair made in heaven  its true that this movie  little flaws apart  does not pander to the average audiences  but those interested in watching an excellent  while  again  not beyond criticism  movie of the incomparable director who gave us  the shop on the main street   the best movie ever about holocaust  should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that  american beauty  is better than  the angel levine   it isnt 
"(Only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />I've enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar, and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro, whose superb ""Devil's Backbone"", set in Civil War Spain, was the finest horror film of the last decade. It's no surprise, then, that this film is both well-made, well-acted, and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere. But it's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />What actually is the purpose of all this? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree, despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice-over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence, set more than a decade earlier, we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control-freakery (""if I can't have you nobody can.""). Oddly enough, that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree, which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. What happened to him in jail to cause this change? We have no idea, though we do later discover, as an absurd sort of afterthought, that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />In Britain, in several of our notorious ""serial killer"" or ""sex killer"" cases, the terrible question arises; what about the wife? Did she know, or suspect what was going on? This is a question that this film could have asked, and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. But banally, the answer to the question is quite clearly: ""No, she didn't"". Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate, the film still manages to bungle it. All we actually get, sketched perfunctorily out at the end, is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place, where Christie's wife says ""you know what I mean."" thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(Major spoiler in this paragraph). In the meantime, we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police, thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. How exactly did he achieve this? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why, or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds, remains a mystery.<br /><br />I actually don't believe serial killers are like this. The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff, but  Lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right. They are deeply disturbed, deeply dysfunctional, deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here (closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie, or indeed even Man Bites Dog, though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />This film has little suspense, and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers, either generally, or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain. This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. And oddly, what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. Just one explicit shot, properly timed, would have been infinitely more shocking, and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary, freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. Very, very creepy. I'm sorry to be rude; I love horror films, and can tolerate even the most extreme, to the extent even of worrying my partner. But I think anyone who finds this film good, or interesting, even I'd find myself edging away from. The purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. I have to give this film more than one star just because it's competently executed, but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made.",0, only minor spoilers except as noted   ive enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently  both the actual spanish cinema of people like almodovar  and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro  whose superb  devils backbone   set in civil war spain  was the finest horror film of the last decade  its no surprise  then  that this film is both well made  well acted  and manages to sustain that distinctively different spanish atmosphere  but its also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see  what actually is the purpose of all this  we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree  despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal  in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence  set more than a decade earlier  we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control freakery   if i cant have you nobody can     oddly enough  that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film  but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree  which appears completely different in both motivation and execution  what happened to him in jail to cause this change  we have no idea  though we do later discover  as an absurd sort of afterthought  that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned  in britain  in several of our notorious  serial killer  or  sex killer  cases  the terrible question arises  what about the wife  did she know  or suspect what was going on  this is a question that this film could have asked  and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters  but banally  the answer to the question is quite clearly   no  she didnt   even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate  the film still manages to bungle it  all we actually get  sketched perfunctorily out at the end  is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event  compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place  where christies wife says  you know what i mean   thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror   major spoiler in this paragraph   in the meantime  we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police  thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again  how exactly did he achieve this  the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point  something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police  but how this all works or why  or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds  remains a mystery  i actually dont believe serial killers are like this  the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff  but  lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right  they are deeply disturbed  deeply dysfunctional  deeply inadequate people  not the creepily charming mastermind presented here  closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie  or indeed even man bites dog  though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire   this film has little suspense  and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated  it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers  either generally  or in the specific cultural milieu of spain  this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women  and oddly  what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented  the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory  just one explicit shot  properly timed  would have been infinitely more shocking  and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary  freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation  instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear  very  very creepy  im sorry to be rude  i love horror films  and can tolerate even the most extreme  to the extent even of worrying my partner  but i think anyone who finds this film good  or interesting  even id find myself edging away from  the purpose of a horror film is to scare you  this is just lascivious  it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed  i have to give this film more than one star just because its competently executed  but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made

"In this swimming pool, this pond, there are water lilies and there are frogs. Frogs sit on water lilies. The frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship. Marie(Pauline Acquart) is a water lily, a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on Floraine(Adele Haenel), a frog, the captain of her team. Floraine's teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well-proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer's mindset of conformity and discipline. But Floraine has a secret; the bombshell has a bombshell, which ""Naissance des pieuvres"" reveals to the audience, visually, before she confides in Marie.<br /><br />Floraine has never gone, as they say, all the way, with a boy.<br /><br />At a party, we see a double-image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make-up in a bathroom mirror. ""Lolita"" is a fata morgana. Marie gets to know Floraine's double while her imitation breaks the water lily's heart. While the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance's sake, she gets chummy with the water lily when no one's looking. In the film's most startling scene, the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation. Floraine wants boys to like her, but she doesn't like boys, seemingly, but it's more important to the frog that she's popular. When the water lily finally kisses the frog, the frog remains a frog. The frog can't transform into a water lily, or a princess, because the water lily lost the frog's respect. After their lips unlock, Floraine tells Marie, ""See, it's easy,"" which is the frog's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite-of-passage without any strings attached. Floraine's beauty is a burden. She carries the weight of meeting boy's expectations. Florence uses Marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet.<br /><br />The other water lily, the other frog, Marie's best friend Anne(Louise Blachere) and Floraine's frustrated boy-toy Francois(Warren Jacobs), just like any water lily and frog, have a parasitic relationship, too. While Floraine uses Marie for love, Francois uses Anne for sex. But that's life; that's the treachery of growing up, in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself. At a McDonalds, the water lily chastises the other water lily after bathing extensively in the frog's afterglow. Physical beauty is a currency. Marie gets to call the shots because Anne, although far from being ugly, is overweight and has an unflattering hairdo. Anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation(the magnifying glass from her Happy Meal incidentally comments on Marie's flat chest), but the tadpole(Marie thinks she's better than Anne, better than a water lily) points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat. <br /><br />Teenaged girls can be brutal to each other.<br /><br />Later, in the final shot, ""Naissance des pieuvres"" suggests that Marie has a double, too, and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near-future, if it not already has.

Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again. That is why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish High Schools. It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism. The American pilot who gets involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses for the democratically elected Republican Government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever made. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (could anybody tell me the difference between Any war and a Civil war ?)is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again. A film like 'El viaje de Carol'/ 'Carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th Century. It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again great work from the Peninsula Iberica !,1,yesterday my spanish   catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history  spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again  that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools  it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism  the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government  the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made  the colors are magnificent  the cruelty of a war  could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war   is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other  the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again  a film like el viaje de carol  carols journey tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century  it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain  again great work from the peninsula iberica

"This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao acted extremely well in this, also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies. This is a must see movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This movie is also from the makers of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is their best right now... the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction.

"Yesterday I attended the world premiere of ""Descent"" at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I had a great time. It was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my-spacer Marcus Patrick.<br /><br />I give the movie 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars.<br /><br />The movie begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) at college. You can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on. The photography in this film was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become sweethearts. It appears like any other relationship in the beginning. The man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get. Both played this well. Very innocent flirtation between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart.<br /><br />The apartment is very dreary and dark. They eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. This actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her. This is a very dark and gritty rape scene. This scene is not for the young or weak at heart. The rape scene is a little long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows.<br /><br />Maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there. She is told to go see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say ""he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving"". He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie. The club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience.<br /><br />Maya is then back in college as a TA and who is in her class -- Jared her rapist!! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. What should I do?? What do I do next?? The shots of her face and the emotions are priceless.<br /><br />What unfolds next is not actually whats happening. She acts interested in Jared. She appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again. I was sitting there saying could this really be happening. It wasn't. Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br /><br />She invites him to her apartment and of course, he shows up. Now her apartment is dark and gritty. She has him strip down completely. He thinks he's going to get ""lucky"". She then teases him like any woman can. She's caressing him everywhere and he's getting excited. Note:: for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity - may not be right for the younger viewer.<br /><br />She then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him. Once again, the scene is dark, gritty, and very rough.<br /><br />If you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph.<br /><br />This is where Adrian reenters the picture. Maya has Adrian save(?) her by performing extremely rough male sex with Jared. She thinks this is the final revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing. Marcus, as Adrian, plays this scene as believable as anyone can. He is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen. After the movie, during a Q&A session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her but I don't think it does. One of the final scenes has a closeup of Mays's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek. This was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie. Did she get the revenge she wanted?? Was it as satisfying as she expected?? In my opinion, it does not. It only makes matters worse.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie, will well acted roles, and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it. I would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age. Rosario, Chad, and Marcus should be commended for jobs well done. The directing and photography must also be commended.

"Having endured this inaccurate movie I will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. Yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would have probably been better cast as Sam Houston given both men's love of oratory. I think self-absorbed Dennis Quaid(an actual Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset I feel Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan even though not born here. Our unofficial motto is ""It ain't braggin' if it is a fact"" was made for Crockett. And that last scene at the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett ever made. To even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. Finally, that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texicans vs 700 Mexican Soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas school kid who pays attention in their first Texas history class knows the battle took the Mexican Army by surprise during siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand.",0,having endured this inaccurate movie i will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions  yet  it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it  davy crockett was very poorly represented by billy bob  who i thought would have probably been better cast as sam houston given both mens love of oratory  i think self absorbed dennis quaid an actual texan  would have been a perfect crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self worship  as a texan and a true believer in the texas mindset i feel davy crockett was the quintessential texan even though not born here  our unofficial motto is  it aint braggin if it is a fact  was made for crockett  and that last scene at the alamo where crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to davy crockett ever made  to even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous  three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat  finally  that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of san jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 texicans vs 700 mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1 500 well trained mexican regulars  every texas school kid who pays attention in their first texas history class knows the battle took the mexican army by surprise during siesta time and the mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand 
"I should have known I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the lead character. Words cannot describe, nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was.

"A first time director (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged, middle class, depressed hit-man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as the 6 year old son of William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in awhile. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. It's always great to see Donald Sutherland and here he's wonderful as the callous father of Macy. The films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast, locations, and filmed the movie. The basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded. The cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background. Any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he's a fan of contradiction.",1,a first time director  bromell  has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged  middle class  depressed hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father  this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature  david dorfman as the 6 year old son of william h  macy is the most refreshing little actor ive seen in awhile  macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business  its always great to see donald sutherland and here hes wonderful as the callous father of macy  the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast  locations  and filmed the movie  the basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded  the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background  any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if hes a fan of contradiction 
"This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies may be entertaining, but they need some substance, to do so. It did not happen here, I am afraid. Mr Coppola did not inherit his father's skills, unfortunately (neither did his sister, who can however make movies which one might watch).<br /><br />I do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews. <br /><br />Let's see: the lead male actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says, the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element, the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks... Would that be enough?<br /><br />I regretted every single moment I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie.

"I had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining, like other sorts of its genre. However, it was lame and I didn't find myself laughing very much. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I don't recommend paying to see it.<br /><br />The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been funny, maybe, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just don't go see this one. The directing is lackluster, but for what it is, directing isn't that important. I guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny.

"Every motion picture Bette Davis stars in is worth experiencing. Before Davis co-stars with Leslie Howard in ""Of Human Bondage,"" she'd been in over a score of movies. Legend has it that Davis was 'robbed' of a 1935 Oscar for her performance as a cockney-speaking waitress, unwed mother & manipulative boyfriend-user, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that the AFI consoled Davis by awarding her 1st Oscar for playing Joyce Heath in ""Dangerous."" I imagine Davis' fans of ""Of Human Bondage"" who agree with the Oscar-robbing legend are going to have at my critique's contrast of the 1934 film for which the AFI didn't award her performance & the 1936 film ""Dangerous,"" performance for which she received her 1st Oscar in 1937.<br /><br />I've tried to view all of Bette Davis' motion pictures, TV interviews, videos, advertisements for WWII & TV performances in popular series. In hindsight, it is easy to recognize why this film, ""Of Human Bondage,"" gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance. She was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach Hollywood's red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in ""Of Human Bondage."" That is what makes it her legendary performance. But, RKO saw her greatness in ""The Man Who Played God,"" & borrowed her from Warners to play Rogers.<br /><br />I'm going to go with the AFI, in hindsight, some 41 years after their astute decision to award Davis her 1st Best Actress Oscar for ""Dangerous,"" 2 years later. By doing so, the AFI may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of Hollywood's most talented 20th century actors. Because, from ""Of Human Bondage,"" onward, Davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue. Doubtless, she deserved more than 2 Oscars; perhaps as many as 6.<br /><br />""Dangerous"" provides an exemplary contrast in Davis' depth of acting characterization. For, it's in ""Dangerous"" (1936) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is so good as Joyce Heath, she's dead-center on the red carpet. Whereas in ""Of Human Bondage,"" Davis is right off the edge, still on the sidewalk & ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career.<br /><br />Perhaps by not awarding her that legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of a star being born, an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor's greatest work.<br /><br />It is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was Joan Crawford; a star whose performances still don't measure up to Davis'. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a 'star'. Howard Stern is a radio host 'star', too. Lots of people on stage & the silver screen are stars. Few became great actors. The key difference between them is something that Bette Davis could sense: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star-struck.<br /><br />Try comparing these two movies as I have, viewing one right after the other. Maybe you'll recognize what the AFI & I did. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo & achieved her goal by the time she was 27. She spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached . . . yet.<br /><br />Had the AFI sent her the message that she'd arrived in ""Of Human Bondage,"" Davis' life history as a great actor may have been led into star-struck-dom, instead.",1,every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing  before davis co stars with leslie howard in  of human bondage   shed been in over a score of movies  legend has it that davis was robbed of a 1935 oscar for her performance as a cockney speaking waitress  unwed mother   manipulative boyfriend user  mildred rogers  the story goes that the afi consoled davis by awarding her 1st oscar for playing joyce heath in  dangerous   i imagine davis fans of  of human bondage  who agree with the oscar robbing legend are going to have at my critiques contrast of the 1934 film for which the afi didnt award her performance   the 1936 film  dangerous   performance for which she received her 1st oscar in 1937  ive tried to view all of bette davis motion pictures  tv interviews  videos  advertisements for wwii   tv performances in popular series  in hindsight  it is easy to recognize why this film   of human bondage   gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance  she was only 25yo when the film was completed   just about to reach hollywoods red carpet  the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in  of human bondage   that is what makes it her legendary performance  but  rko saw her greatness in  the man who played god     borrowed her from warners to play rogers  im going to go with the afi  in hindsight  some 41 years after their astute decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for  dangerous   2 years later  by doing so  the afi may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of hollywoods most talented 20th century actors  because  from  of human bondage   onward  davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue  doubtless  she deserved more than 2 oscars  perhaps as many as 6   dangerous  provides an exemplary contrast in davis depth of acting characterization  for  its in  dangerous   1936  that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century  davis is so good as joyce heath  shes dead center on the red carpet  whereas in  of human bondage   davis is right off the edge  still on the sidewalk   ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career  perhaps by not awarding her that legendary oscar in 1935  instead of a star being born  an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actors greatest work  it is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was joan crawford  a star whose performances still dont measure up to davis  even anna nicole smith was a star  howard stern is a radio host star  too  lots of people on stage   the silver screen are stars  few became great actors  the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense  the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star struck  try comparing these two movies as i have  viewing one right after the other  maybe youll recognize what the afi   i did  davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo   achieved her goal by the time she was 27  she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached       yet  had the afi sent her the message that shed arrived in  of human bondage   davis life history as a great actor may have been led into star struck dom  instead 
"The books of James Michener taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His Tales of the South Pacific became a major blockbuster Broadway hit for Rodgers&Hammerstein. South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another Michener success, Sayonara.<br /><br />It was only a decade before that American films during World War II did not portray the Japanese kindly. I'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the Pacific war to change attitudes overnight. That and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance.<br /><br />Sayonara is a relevant film today. The military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally. In America at the time Sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states. Today gays in the military is a big issue. Someone may one day do a Sayonara like film on that issue.<br /><br />Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. South Pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. With a sure hand, Logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story.<br /><br />Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith some of the occidental players do a fine job. But the picture is stolen by the orientals here. Miko Taka hits the mark beautifully as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two that one both Supporting players Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki.<br /><br />Buttons is your everyman enlisted man Air Force member. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up. They presume to KNOW what's best for Buttons and Umeki. Buttons was a TV comedian and a fair talent, but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career.<br /><br />And Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first one given to an oriental. It got a great deal of attention because at the time of the Academy Awards, Miyoshi was starring on Broadway in Flower Drum Song. I was privileged to see it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I ever saw. I still carry the memory of it.<br /><br />That Oscar symbolized something else too. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw in Sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, a Kabuki Theatre actor. If Sayonara were done today, Logan would never get away with it. But Montalban is fine. <br /><br />Good location photography and a grand story.

"""Diary of Sex Addict"" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness.

"Sometimes a film comes along that is unique. The Nostril Picker is one such film, The Nostril Picker is like no other film I have ever seen, unfortunately for The Nostril Picker & myself it's unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had originally intended. Read on & all shall hopefully become clear... The Nostril Picker, as it's commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title The Changer, starts with some extremely dull shots of an American town somewhere, streets & factory's that sort of thing, as the opening credits play. When The Nostril Picker begins proper we, the viewer that is, are introduced to a real loser named Joe Bukowski (Carl Zschering) who is in his 40's, he lives on his own in a crappy little apartment where he watches T.V., eats beef flavoured dog food & listens to old vinyl records as he dances with a blow up rubber sex doll. Joe likes teenage girls, he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more. However, being an ugly git Joe can't tempt any young ladies to go out with him, or do anything else with him for that matter. One fateful day an old homeless Vietnam vet (Horace Grimm) sees the agony & pain that Joe has to go through (actually he sees Joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a teenage girl) & decides to help him out. He tells Joe about an incantation that he learned from the 'gooks' in Vietnam that will transform Joe's appearance into whatever he likes. A process he calls morphosynthesis, but at the same time he warns Joe that 'it makes you crazy if you do it too much'. That night Joe decides to give it a try, in a public place on a podium for some reason. Joe says a few words, does an extremely silly dance & starts yodelling. Joe finishes off by whistling London Bridge is Falling Down, listen yeah, I ain't making this up either. At first Joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens. To console himself Joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk (Kevin Devoy) refuses to sell it to an underage girl. Joe, the bright spark that he is, realises what has happened & talks his/her way out of it by claiming his/her dad had sent him/her to buy it. Joe, who now calls his alter-ego Josephine (Ann Flood), senses the possibilities & heads straight for the local high school. Joe befriends four teenage girls, Jennifer Armstrong (Laura Cummings), Crisi Stroud (Gail Didia), Tracy Harper (Heidi M. Gregg) & Brenda Kearn (Aimee Molinaro) while under his disguise, oh & Joe manages to become a pupil at the school simply by asking the sports teacher Miss Van Dyke (Vicki Hollis). At first Joe seems harmless enough, he just likes to hang around the girls toilets & stuff like that. But things soon change as Joe brutally murders Brenda. Jennifer's dad, Vince Armstrong (Edward Tanner) is a detective so along with his partner Ed Simpson (Clyde Surrell) & Walt Spencer (Bruce Alden) the pathologist is determined to catch the sicko responsible for killing his daughter's friends, but will they succeed before Joe strikes again? The IMDb listing for The Nostril Picker is wrong, I watched it mere hours ago & it clearly states that it's directed by Mark Nowicki who was also a co-producer & definitely not Patrick J. Matthews who was credited as a co-producer & the cinematographer, not that it makes much difference & I'd have though that Nowicki would have been more than happy for Matthews to take the 'credit' for making this piece of crap. No one involved in the making of The Nostril Picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again, ever. The Nostril Picker is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen, & that's saying something. It's absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable. The script by Steven Hodge is atrocious, there's no narrative structure, excitement, tension, drama, character development & the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb it's untrue. The plot devices & chain of events in The Nostril Picker are totally incomprehensible. The scene where Joe finds out the prostitute (Steven Andrews) he hired is in fact a man & Joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildo's is simply jaw dropping stuff. The subsequent scene when the transvestite reports the incident to the police is hilariously written & had me psychically laughing at the dialogue. I hated the ending as well, not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel, I psychically shudder at the mere thought! On a technical level The Nostril Picker is awful, point & hope photography, bland & inappropriate music, forgettable locations, poorly edited (Brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood splashes on the T.V. screen that was clearly in the opposite room), some of the worst acting I've sat through & very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers, a slit throat & a quick scene where Joe eats some flesh. It comes as no surprise that the cast & crew who worked on The Nostril Picker have virtually no IMDb credits for anything before or after. Even at 76 odd minutes The Nostril Picker is far to long & really boring to sit through. I could go on & on all day long about how bad The Nostril Picker is, I really could. One thing I can't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers? The Nostril Picker is indeed a unique film, unique in it's awfulness & incompetence. In the the case of The Nostril Picker I hope it remains unique too, having said that it's still not the worst film I've ever seen but it comes close that's for sure. Definitely one to avoid.",0,sometimes a film comes along that is unique  the nostril picker is one such film  the nostril picker is like no other film i have ever seen  unfortunately for the nostril

"I can't believe that the City of Muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. This show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law-enforcement officers. I have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie. I only saw it once and was appalled at what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy get into a foot-chase with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the Police Chief, and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city.

"The performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again.

"I was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of films since,but I've never forgotten this one.Although Sinatra was playing a not very endearing character,he was excellent in the role.A lot of people seem to think that he did'nt really come into his own until his role in ""From Here To Eternity"" but in my opinion he was magnificent in Concho.The other role that sticks in my mind is that of William Conrad.I'd never see or heard of him before this film. Conrad plays a terrific part in this film.I remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character.Also I remember the music, that both introduces Conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears.An excellent film and my only disappointment was that I never ever got the chance to see it again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth.

"I dunno sometimes...you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the B thru Z grade movies out there, but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. ""Bat People"" (which I saw under the title ""It Lives By Night"") is just such a movie. You can't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on ""Night Gallery"", and not one of the better ones, either. <br /><br />The movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a Were-Bat who drinks human blood. (Actually, you'd think if he was turning into a real bat, he'd be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, lurid horror movie, blood's the word.) In spite of the fact that he has grand-mal seizures at the drop of a hat, and black-out episodes almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists that he's just having an 'allergic reaction' to the rabies shots. Meanwhile, the world's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls (and one wino). Also meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that denial IS a river in Egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction. <br /><br />It's not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices, and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (Okay, it IS pretty bad, but it's bad in a clichéd, wooden, professional way). It's just that everything about the acting, the way the scenes are paced, the costumes, the dialog, the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to, well, slap everyone involved.<br /><br />I think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky, unsettling little cult favorite, BUT:<br /><br />1)The director needed to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced character actor, with a chair until Pataki agreed to ACT, and not just channel Dennis Weaver. <br /><br />2)He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole ""Bat Bites Human, Who Then Turns Into A Bat"" scenario. <br /><br />3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his 'episodes', instead of resorting to ""Man Has A Seizure"" page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms. <br /><br />4) He needed to rework the whole 'wife' character, make her both more intelligent, less shrill and waaaaay more observant. <br /><br />I would never voluntarily watch this film again, except with the help of Mike and the Bots. It's bad, but it isn't bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. Still better than ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Waterworld"", though.",0,i dunno sometimes   you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there  but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved   bat people   which i saw under the title  it lives by night   is just such a movie  you cant watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on  night gallery   and not one of the better ones  either   the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were bat who drinks human blood   actually  youd think if he was turning into a real bat  hed be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket  but because this is a cheap  lurid horror movie  bloods the word   in spite of the fact that he has grand mal seizures at the drop of a hat  and black out episodes almost every night  his friend and fellow physician  dr  mustache aspen extreme  insists that hes just having an allergic reaction to the rabies shots  meanwhile  the worlds most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls  and one wino   also meanwhile  the doctors wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction   its not so much that the acting is bad   you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices  and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script  even the guy who plays the sheriff   okay  it is pretty bad  but its bad in a clichéd  wooden  professional way   its just that everything about the acting  the way the scenes are paced  the costumes  the dialog  the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to  well  slap everyone involved  i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky  unsettling little cult favorite  but  1 the director needed to beat michael pataki  an experienced character actor  with a chair until pataki agreed to act  and not just channel dennis weaver   2 he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole  bat bites human  who then turns into a bat  scenario   3  he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episodes  instead of resorting to  man has a seizure  page from the little golden book of clichéd acting mannerisms   4  he needed to rework the whole wife character  make her both more intelligent  less shrill and waaaaay more observant   i would never voluntarily watch this film again  except with the help of mike and the bots  its bad  but it isnt bad in a silly  humorous or interesting way  still better than  battlefield earth  or  waterworld   though

"Having just finished Cronicles of the Heroic Knight mere minutes ago I find myself extremely please but questions still loom over me. While it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first Record of Lodoss War the truth is that they really aren't. It would appear that the creator of CotHK had a different vision as to how the original ended (and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur) but I do not find that to be the case. CotHK does say it starts 5 years after the War of Heros which Parn was a part of. I think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into Spark's story. Now, once the series does kick into Spark's portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years (15 years now since the War of Heros). Spark and his crew do, in some cases, resemble Parn and his crew once the journey kicks into gear, especially the love story that brews between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times throughout CotHK that I threw in the original series and if it wasn't for Spark's long blue hair I know I would've pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in. By no means do I consider these major set backs however, the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline. The only thing that makes me hurt is that Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm... how??? Don't get me wrong both are great villains even though Ashram's only villainous trait is that he supports the Marmo. Perhaps I missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part. As far as sequels go though, I highly recommend CotHK. I place both CotHK and, even more so, the original Record of Lodoss War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both of these are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend this.",1,having just finished cronicles of the heroic knight mere minutes ago i find myself extremely please but questions still loom over me  while it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first record of lodoss war the truth is that they really arent  it would appear that the creator of cothk had a different vision as to how the original ended  and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur  but i do not find that to be the case  cothk does say it starts 5 years after the war of heros which parn was a part of  i think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into sparks story  now  once the series does kick into sparks portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years  15 years now since the war of heros   spark and his crew do  in some cases  resemble parn and his crew once the journey kicks into gear  especially the love story that brews between spark and neese  i also thought several times throughout cothk that i threw in the original series and if it wasnt for sparks long blue hair i know i wouldve pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in  by no means do i consider these major set backs however  the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline  the only thing that makes me hurt is that ashram and wagnard return  ummmm    how    dont get me wrong both are great villains even though ashrams only villainous trait is that he supports the marmo  perhaps i missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part  as far as sequels go though  i highly recommend cothk  i place both cothk and  even more so  the original record of lodoss war far above the lord of the rings trilogy  both of these are more epic than anything ive ever seen or read  i highly recommend this

"I just saw this movie, and I have to say that it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can't act at all. She read her lines very un-naturally, and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural. She played her part with great perfection.<br /><br />SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it many, many times before. She breaks up, he finds another, she get jealous, he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end. There were no surprises at all, one knew that Eva would break up, and that Adam would ""hook up"" with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw coming was that Petra told Adam to go after Eva at the party. She became all serious, which is a side of Petra the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie, and told him to win Eva's heart back, which was really cute.<br /><br />Besides Rosanna Munter, there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance.<br /><br />This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I don't recommend it!",0,i just saw this movie  and i have to say that it was a big waste of time  the girl who played eva  ellen fjaestad  cant act at all  she read her lines very un naturally  and she had a very un natural facial expression through the entire movie  rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand  is a natural  she played her part with great perfection  spoilers  the story was simple   weve seen it many  many times before  she breaks up  he finds another  she get jealous  he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end  there were no surprises at all  one knew that eva would break up  and that adam would  hook up  with petra  the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party  she became all serious  which is a side of petra the viewers hadnt seen earlier in the movie  and told him to win evas heart back  which was really cute  besides rosanna munter  there isnt a single actor who gives a memorable performance  this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors  so i dont recommend it 
"Watching Fire and Ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year. It wasn't at all a bad movie, certainly not average, but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional (which, perhaps as based on Frank Miller's comic book, was the right decision to go with). But its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat, with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings. While I would probably re-watch Fire and Ice before 300 again, they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being, naturally, that it's Frank Frazetta, the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics, collaborating with director Ralph Bakshi, in what isn't typical Hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans.<br /><br />What this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time (it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their Masters of the Universe VHS tapes back in the day) is the possible cons mentioned before and, maybe, that you will see something somewhat unique. Fire and Ice isn't even the only Bakshi rotoscoped feature, but it's possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made, and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre-historic, part out-of-this-world fantastic, and part medieval, and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds, the skies and grounds. There's a slight drawback for Bakshi fans in this facet of character design; Bakshi went as far as to say it's more Frazetta than him. This may be true, but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion (my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide- how they rotoscoped that amazes me).<br /><br />I neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. If you're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a 'damsel' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada, so suffice to say it's about, well, Fire against Ice, with characters named Nekron and Darkwolf (the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance) and Teegra (the typical hottie who's almost *too* perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure). What the plot does do, as an asset, is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action, the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle, like when the ogres are hunting after Teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes. And per usual for Bakshi, he conjures up some craziness (if not quite his usual inspired lunacy) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material. If you've seen Wizards, you'll understand what I mean to a lesser extent.<br /><br />So, if you're an animation buff, seek this out right away for some 'old-school' (i.e. 1980s) action and incredible design. For everyone else, it's... good, not great, as I would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension, with some alterations, 300.",1,watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year  it wasnt at all a bad movie  certainly not average  but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one dimensional  which  perhaps as based on frank millers comic book  was the right decision to go with   but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword led combat  with the occasional freaky creature or super hot female to go with the painterly surroundings  while i would probably re watch fire and ice before 300 again  they both aroused that similar feeling   the exception this time being  naturally  that its frank frazetta  the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics  collaborating with director ralph bakshi  in what isnt typical hollywood fare but something for the die hard fans  what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time  it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day  is the possible cons mentioned before and  maybe  that you will see something somewhat unique  fire and ice isnt even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature  but its possibly the most fluid  if not quite my personal favorite  of the few he made  and he and his team create a whole striking world thats part pre historic  part out of this world fantastic  and part medieval  and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds  the skies and grounds  theres a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design  bakshi went as far as to say its more frazetta than him  this may be true  but it doesnt make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we dont see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion  my favorite was the momentary skeleton guide  how they rotoscoped that amazes me   i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it  if youre already a die hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a damsel or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada  so suffice to say its about  well  fire against ice  with characters named nekron and darkwolf  the coolest male of the lot and most comic book in appearance  and teegra  the typical hottie whos almost  too  perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure   what the plot does do  as an asset  is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action  the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle  like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes  and per usual for bakshi  he conjures up some craziness  if not quite his usual inspired lunacy  in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material  if youve seen wizards  youll understand what i mean to a lesser extent  so  if youre an animation buff  seek this out right away for some old school  i e  1980s  action and incredible design  for everyone else  its    good  not great  as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension  with some alterations  300

"OK, I am blessed. I have seen two very strong stage productions, the one in New York with the original cast, and another at the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable. I've been plodding through the DVD for the past two evenings and am still not finished. Way too much extraneous dialog, and waaay too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four major performances are quite good, esp. Ms. Streep's. But comparing stage to film is definitely an example of ""less is more."" The thickening of the play to satisfy film-goers' need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice.

"ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into. Characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were going to be front and center. The rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks. The series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in.<br /><br />Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner. The rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do. Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve. ANDYs' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way. Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946) his reaction to any 'teapot tempest' was the same, juvenile.<br /><br />In this film it is clearly illustrated. ANDY gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved. This screen writing device was known as the 'idiot plot'. A means of stretching a poorly written scenario. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys' fault then the Director and the Writers. Most likely George B. Seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control Rooneys' excesses.

"Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best), 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke-hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'. And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke. While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. And that would be a crime.<br /><br />As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service') - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek (Yeah, the Dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs...), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty) and Mandy Patinkin (Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...)

"Luckily, not knowing anything about this movie I was curious enough to tape it from TV. And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!<br /><br />But I'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. Considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. And it's not just because of the two George's actresses.<br /><br />The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, And it certainly did hit me. Very effective. Also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well, being a case of war, mostly bad.<br /><br />For the fans of composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fräulein! Let's hope they get this on DVD soon, so I can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.",1,luckily  not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv  and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending  but im glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie  there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots  but also very chilling and even daring moments  considering the production year 1969  the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows  of course now it doesnt surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done  and its not just because of the two georges actresses  the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly  no wonder  and it certainly did hit me  very effective  also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action  this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side  but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad  well  being a case of war  mostly bad  for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must  his work is always excellent  touching but never over the top  and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall  talk about fräulein  lets hope they get this on dvd soon  so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem 
"This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids.

"Christopher Durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun, because he just can't let go of the concept. The play, ""Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You,"" was presented -- at least in Hollywood -- in precisely the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture scenes here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a lampoon, a bitter satire of a serenely confident, doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun -- and as played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously -- while, as mentioned, maintaining the same tone in the ""explains it all"" scenes. The two approaches clash headlong and in the last twenty minutes, the movie goes off the track, plunges into the gorge, and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked, if the tone of the scenes with the four former students, and their encounter with Sister Mary, been pitched the same as the Sister Mary scenes. Or if the Sister Mary scenes been presented more realistically.

"If Saura hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone. Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of Spanish culture, but he has done a lot like this before, and though we can applaud the riches he has given us, we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include Blood Wedding (1981), Carmen (1983), El Amore Brujo (1986), Sevillanas (1992), Salomé (2002) and Tango (1998). I would choose Saura's 1995 Flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document, next to which Iberia pales.<br /><br />Iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz (1860-1909) and in particular his ""Iberia"" suite for piano. Isaac Albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of Spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-Spanish audience. He moved to France in his early thirties and was influenced by French composers. His ""Iberia"" suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of Liszt, Dukas and d'Indy. He traveled around performing his compositions, which are a kind of beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies, not as homogenized as Ravel's Bolero but moving in that direction. Naturally, the Spanish have repossessed Albéniz, and in Iberia, the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles. But the source is a tamed and diluted form of Spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt Spanishness of pure flamenco. Flamenco, coming out of the region of Andalusia, is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane, Hispano-Arabic, and Jewish cultures. Iberia simply is the peninsula comprising Spain, Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar; the very concept is more diluted. <br /><br />Saura's Flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music, singing, dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of Spanish style, the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are. Saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer Antonio Gades and other artists. In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers, musicians, and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens, flats, and mirrors arranged by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, another of the Spanish filmmaker's important collaborators. The beginnings and endings of sequences in Flamenco are often rough, but atmospheric, marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices. Sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over, sigh, or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something. In Flamenco more than any of Saura's other musical films it's the rapt, intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olé's that is the ""story"" and creates the magic. Because Saura has truly made magic, and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story.<br /><br />Iberia is in a similar style to some of Saura's purest musical films: no narration, no dialogue, only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region, beginning with a pianist playing Albeniz's music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing. In flamenco music, the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice, and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music. It relates to other songs in other ethnicities, but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly-beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention. Then comes the clapping and the foot stomping, and then the dancing, combined with the other elements. There is only one flamenco song in Iberia. If you love Saura's Flamenco, you'll want to see Iberia, but you'll be a bit disappointed. The style is there; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there. But Iberia's source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience.",1,if saura hadnt done anything like this before  iberia would be a milestone  now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture  but he has done a lot like this before  and though we can applaud the riches he has given us  we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding  1981   carmen  1983   el amore brujo  1986   sevillanas  1992   salomé  2002  and tango  1998   i would choose sauras 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document  next to which iberia pales  iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albéniz  1860 1909  and in particular his  iberia  suite for piano  isaac albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture    its re formatting for a non spanish audience  he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers  his  iberia  suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt  dukas and dindy  he traveled around performing his compositions  which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies  not as homogenized as ravels bolero but moving in that direction  naturally  the spanish have repossessed albéniz  and in iberia  the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles  but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco  flamenco  coming out of the region of andalusia  is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane  hispano arabic  and jewish cultures  iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain  portugal  andorra and gibraltar  the very concept is more diluted   sauras flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music  singing  dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style  the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache    even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it    in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion  they just are  saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists  in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers  musicians  and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens  flats  and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro  another of the spanish filmmakers important collaborators  the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough  but atmospheric  marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices  sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over  sigh  or laugh  or somebody just unexpectedly says something  in flamenco more than any of sauras other musical films its the rapt  intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olés that is the  story  and creates the magic  because saura has truly made magic  and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story  iberia is in a similar style to some of sauras purest musical films  no narration  no dialogue  only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region  beginning with a pianist playing albenizs music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing  in flamenco music  the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice  and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music  it relates to other songs in other ethnicities  but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention  then comes the clapping and the foot stomping  and then the dancing  combined with the other elements  there is only one flamenco song in iberia  if you love sauras flamenco  youll want to see iberia  but youll be a bit disappointed  the style is there  some of the great voices and dancing and music are there  but iberias source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience 
"This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. The actress replacing Jean Reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film. The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. No attention to camera or shots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101.

This is a particular Sherlock movie but we find to Holmes falling in love with a servant, kissing, crying and even robbing. This time along with the episode ¨Scandal in Boheme¨ with Irene Adler, result to be the only one which Holmes is enamored. Top-notch Brett performance, he alongside Peter Cushing are the best Sherlock TV , while in the cinema is forever Basil Rathbone. Brett performs as a resolutive, headstrong, impetuous sleuth. Here Doctor Watson isn't a comic, botcher, and clumsy pal personified by Nigel Bruce, but is an astute and cunning partner well incarnated by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect counterpoint of Brett. Casting is frankly magnificent, special mention to Robert Hardy as astute nasty. Hardy, today famous by role as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with several success such as, The 10th kingdom and Winston Churchill. Furthermore appear secondaries actors with terrific performances, Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, among others.

"I caught this film on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, a Japanese ""Green Card"". I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. I an not adverse to a light hearted films, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favourites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again.<br /><br />I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. And when any of the characters DID try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before...the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki.. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this ""a refreshing breath of comedy"". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.<br /><br />AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. I actually think that ""Spike of Bensonhurst"" is a better acted film than this...and I walked out half way through that film!",0,i caught this film on azn on cable  it sounded like it would be a good film  a japanese  green card   i cant say ive ever disliked an asian film  quite the contrary  some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean  and i am a huge fan of john woos hong kong films  i an not adverse to a light hearted films  like tampopo or chung king express  two of my favourites   so i thought i would like this  well  i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious  badly acted film ever again  i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude  because no one in this film had a personality  and when any of the characters did try to act  as opposed to mumbling a line or two  their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake  i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before   the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki   i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy  because i didnt laugh once  even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this  a refreshing breath of comedy   it was neither refreshing  nor a breath of comedy  and the ending was very predictable  the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things  avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting  i actually think that  spike of bensonhurst  is a better acted film than this   and i walked out half way through that film 
"North Africa in the 1930's. To a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life & a handsome Trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith. They will meet and passions will be stirred, but not even the Sand Diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow, here, in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH.<br /><br />The plot is pure hokum, but the film is still great fun & beautiful to look at. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple. She is, to put it simply, gorgeous, and Boyer gives a most effective, understated performance, letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him. <br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a Count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (all the ""Arabic"" he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (peeking over the nun's shoulder) as convent girls; gaunt Nigel De Brulier as a monastery lector; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk, all uncredited.<br /><br />Color films of the 1930's are both rare & lovely to look at, and this movie is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to be shot on location. Yuma, Arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire, but contaminated drinking water & 135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt. When the daily rushes showed Boyer's face had burned a bright tomato red, producer David O. Selznick finally gave in.

"This is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back, and then some, like the time you spent accidentally picking it out, the time you spent getting to the video store, etc.<br /><br />First off, the look: It's grainy, it's low budget. Now that in itself doesn't make for a bad film. But the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so that's kind of distracting.<br /><br />Then, the story. 3 gals go on a gal's weekend away from guys. Of course, as EVERYONE does when going on a camping trip, they stop on the way to get earrings. When they arrive at the area in which they're going to stay, they get pulled over by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season, and then drives them where they're going (a remote cabin). Of course, 2 ""cute guys"" wander into their vicinity, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately smitten, but apparently Bambi is smitten by anything with two legs. Mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh**-faced and stoned with her gal-pals.<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot, there's a mean old hermit that lives up that way, that's perhaps someone to not tangle with, and the area & cabin in which they're staying have a sort of ""reputation"".<br /><br />So of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, MUCH later) some of our weekend wood-visitors begin to die, and find various booby traps (although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that) and of course, the remaining campers are understandably upset. No cell phone reception of course (who would miss out on a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore?). Mr. Ranger Sir keeps popping up at odd times & his behavior seems a bit odd but he has said he will get help.<br /><br />There's a fantastic twist to this that you just won't want to miss too, if you're still awake. Pray that you wake up to a blank screen.<br /><br />The acting in this is terrible, the production values are terrible, and the whole undertaking is just lame & I find it amazing this was even released.

"Unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closure to the ""Nightmare on Elm Street""-series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke. This isn't just the worst entry in the ""Elm Street"" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre! The story is dumb, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it appears that Freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter. You'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures, but no There's only one teenage-survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults! How about that: Freddy Krueger, who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers, eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3D-glasses! Sort of like ruins the whole essence, doesn't it? As far as I'm concerned, ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" has always been a dreadfully overrated series but, up until now, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. ""Freddy's Dead"", however, is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his/her precious time watching it.",0,unimaginably stupid  redundant and humiliating closure to the  nightmare on elm street  series  part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes cravens initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke  this isnt just the worst entry in the  elm street  saga  its also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre  the story is dumb  the character drawings are ridiculous  the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom   jerry cartoon  the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting  were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game character and pogo sticked him around the walls of a house  the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle aged daughter  youd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures  but no theres only one teenage survivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter  another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure  the john doe boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults  how about that  freddy krueger  who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers  eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3d glasses  sort of like ruins the whole essence  doesnt it  as far as im concerned   nightmare on elm street  has always been a dreadfully overrated series but  up until now  even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements   freddys dead   however  is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his her precious time watching it 
"This is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago.

"It takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched, beguiling, disgusting and repulsive, but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation. Crispin Glover, in all of his ""out there"" antics and predispositions, truly made something that is unique. In a world that has become starkly partisan, this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone. <br /><br />Right off the bat, the film takes on a rather distant paradigm (if there really is a model at all) and initially shapes it with the likes of Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy. It's rather shocking stuff, but if you had the opportunity for the Q&A sessions after the screenings, it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator. In either guise, you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition. You may not like it, but it is certainly something worth watching.",1,it takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched  beguiling  disgusting and repulsive  but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation  crispin glover  in all of his  out there  antics and predispositions  truly made something that is unique  in a world that has become starkly partisan  this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone   right off the bat  the film takes on a rather distant paradigm  if there really is a model at all  and initially shapes it with the likes of shirley temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy  its rather shocking stuff  but if you had the opportunity for the q a sessions after the screenings  it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator  in either guise  you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause  it will never be accepted  not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition  you may not like it  but it is certainly something worth watching

"Like his elder brothers, Claude Sautet and Jean-Pierre Melville, Alain Corneau began to cut his teeth in French cinema with a series of fine thrillers: ""la Menace"" (1977) and ""Série Noire"" (1979) among others. ""Police Python 357"" is a good example of how Corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career. They had a splendid cinematography, painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake.<br /><br />The police superintendent Ferrot (Yves Montand) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone. He makes the acquaintance of a young woman Sylvia Léopardi (Stefania Sandrelli) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover: his superior Ganay (François Périer). When the latter learns it, he kills her in a fit of anger. Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him...<br /><br />One could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes, one can see right through it but Corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling, dusky atmosphere. The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however, it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment. Corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary, minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation. In spite of drawbacks, Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story. Ménard (Mathieu Carrière) who sometimes expresses his surprise because Ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation. But his superior knows that he usually works alone. Actually, Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself. Eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself. He's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization. It is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them.<br /><br />The backdrop of this thriller, Orléans is efficiently enhanced by Corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm.",1,like his elder brothers  claude sautet and jean pierre melville  alain corneau began to cut his teeth in french cinema with a series of fine thrillers   la menace   1977  and  série noire   1979  among others   police python 357  is a good example of how corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career  they had a splendid cinematography  painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiencys sake  the police superintendent ferrot  yves montand  is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone  he makes the acquaintance of a young woman sylvia léopardi  stefania sandrelli  and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover  his superior ganay  françois périer   when the latter learns it  he kills her in a fit of anger  ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him    one could deem that this kind of far fetched story isnt exempt from glitches and sometimes  one can see right through it but corneaus pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling  dusky atmosphere  the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however  it is crucial for what will follow this key moment  corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary  minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation  in spite of drawbacks  corneau and his scenarist daniel boulanger penned a deft story  ménard  mathieu carrière  who sometimes expresses his surprise because ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation  but his superior knows that he usually works alone  actually  ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself  eventually  the chief idea of the film concerns ferrot himself  hes a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization  it is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses wont recognize him when he is brought face to face with them  the backdrop of this thriller  orléans is efficiently enhanced by corneaus camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm 
"Everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie! My grandma could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one. The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it. Clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part, Robin is trying to act like Lemercier (because she's replacing her) but that's grotesque'. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny by herself on stage, she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act. I know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role (Lemercier obtained a César award for her role in the first movie) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played Lemercier playing her role'! As for the story, it's just too much! Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode. The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, really, there's no more than 3 funny parts in this. The only good things might be the costumes and some special effects.

It was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when Patrica was talking in her monotone voice, she could hardly be heard.<br /><br />I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica had basically 3 emotions. Quiet, in great pain, or really angry she has stigmata. The first was the predominate one, the second involved screaming pain, the third involving raising her voice. It was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion.<br /><br />Maybe I missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible filming and MTV like style. When you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story, in a 2 hour feature film, it's nauseating. I fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child. And no Pittsburg does not rain that often!!<br /><br />I think maybe a real story, with something to say could have been intended, but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that Ms. Arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story.",0,im always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes  people who think its the best movie and people who think its the worst  stigmata wouldnt be the worst movie ive ever seen  but its up there  first of all the sound  the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing  it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice  she could hardly be heard  i usually like patrica and gaberial  but they were both flat in this movie  patrica had basically 3 emotions  quiet  in great pain  or really angry she has stigmata  the first was the predominate one  the second involved screaming pain  the third involving raising her voice  it was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion  maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about  or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style  when you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story  in a 2 hour feature film  its nauseating  i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child  and no pittsburg does not rain that often   i think maybe a real story  with something to say could have been intended  but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms  arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story 
"All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten. Then they start rolling the title credits: You see ""Slugs!"" in big letters, followed shortly thereafter by ""The Movie."" WHEW! I was worried I had accidentally tuned into ""Slugs: The Musical"" or ""Slugs: The Game Show."" Anyway, from there the movie deteriorates into a kill-fest. You see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people get attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs. It's a pretty silly movie, falling in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category. It also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I'm VERY surprised it has received as high a score as it has here, because most people here don't give those types of movie any love. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable, this is one of your prime candidates.",0,all you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene  where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten  then they start rolling the title credits  you see  slugs   in big letters  followed shortly thereafter by  the movie   whew  i was worried i had accidentally tuned into  slugs  the musical  or  slugs  the game show   anyway  from there the movie deteriorates into a kill fest  you see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove  two people get attacked by slugs while having sex  and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs  its a pretty silly movie  falling in the  so bad its good  category  it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that youre shocked to learn it was made in 1988  my guess was 1974   im very surprised it has received as high a score as it has here  because most people here dont give those types of movie any love  but if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable  this is one of your prime candidates

"In Where The Sidewalk Ends, Otto Preminger reunites Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney, surely in hopes of recapturing the magic of his Laura. But they're wildly dissimilar films, set in different strata of New York (not to mention at opposite poles of the noir universe). A fine mist of the Gothic hovers over the upscale Manhattan of Laura, with its erotic obsession and faint whiff of necrophilia; Where The Sidewalk Ends is pure urban soot and grit befouling a town of basement apartments, steam rooms and parking garages.<br /><br />But it's every bit as fine a movie as its revered forerunner, and dyed-in-the-wool noir (Laura, by contrast, one of the clutch of films from 1944 which the French first dubbed `noir,' was still very much a sophisticated murder mystery). Daylight enters only on very temporary sufferance, and director of photography Joseph LaShelle makes the most of the alleys and brownstones, the docks and the El. This is quintessential big-city - specifically Big Apple - noir, like several others from the bumper crop of 1950, like Side Street and Sleeping City and The Tattooed Stranger and Edge of Doom.<br /><br />As the movie opens, police detective Dana Andrews is on the carpet for his brutal ways, particularly his vendetta towards crime boss Gary Merrill (whom we learn was set up in business by Andrews' ne'er-do-well father). When an out-of-towner is stabbed to death at a floating crap game operated by Merrill, the hair-trigger Andrews roughs up a witness, causing him a fatal crack to the skull (exacerbated by a steel plate installed in the veteran's head). Realizing that his job's already on the line, Andrews dumps the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a powder.<br /><br />Of course, that's far from an end to it. The corpse is discovered, his estranged wife turns out to be Tierney, and all the evidence starts to turn toward her father (Tom Tully), a hack driver who happened not only to have been cruising the same mean streets the night of the murder but to have ample reason to want his abusive son-in-law dead. But the embittered loner Andrews finds in Tierney a summons to his better nature; he tries to exonerate her father while still keeping his own involvement in the whole sordid business a secret....<br /><br />Not so epigrammatic as Laura, the script for Where The Sidewalk Ends (by Ben Hecht) shows a pungency of its own (in a second dressing-down, his superior tells Andrews, `Look at you - all bunged up like a barrelhouse fag').<br /><br />But while Laura spread its attention over half a dozen characters, here Andrews is all but the sole focus (even Tierney's role is far less central than her half-spectral Laura). And Andrews may never have excelled his performance here. It's tight-lipped and taciturn, but never more eloquent than when his face is silently registering the anguish to which his own obstinacy has brought him. He's a pent-up sufferer who can find release only through the safety-valve of violence (he even lashes out against his loyal partner, Bert Freed). To be sure, he finds too swift a road to redemption though the agency of his beautiful co-star. But that was the style of the times, and a sweetened-up ending does little to undermine this New York story of violence, corruption and urban entanglements.",1,in where the sidewalk ends  otto preminger reunites dana andrews and gene tierney  surely in hopes of recapturing the magic of his laura  but theyre wildly dissimilar films  set in different strata of new york  not to mention at opposite poles of the noir universe   a fine mist of the gothic hovers over the upscale manhattan of laura  with its erotic obsession and faint whiff of necrophilia  where the sidewalk ends is pure urban soot and grit befouling a town of basement apartments  steam rooms and parking garages  but its every bit as fine a movie as its revered forerunner  and dyed in the wool noir  laura  by contrast  one of the clutch of films from 1944 which the french first dubbed  noir  was still very much a sophisticated murder mystery   daylight enters only on very temporary sufferance  and director of photography joseph lashelle makes the most of the alleys and brownstones  the docks and the el  this is quintessential big city   specifically big apple   noir  like several others from the bumper crop of 1950  like side street and sleeping city and the tattooed stranger and edge of doom  as the movie opens  police detective dana andrews is on the carpet for his brutal ways  particularly his vendetta towards crime boss gary merrill  whom we learn was set up in business by andrews neer do well father   when an out of towner is stabbed to death at a floating crap game operated by merrill  the hair trigger andrews roughs up a witness  causing him a fatal crack to the skull  exacerbated by a steel plate installed in the veterans head   realizing that his jobs already on the line  andrews dumps the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a powder  of course  thats far from an end to it  the corpse is discovered  his estranged wife turns out to be tierney  and all the evidence starts to turn toward her father  tom tully   a hack driver who happened not only to have been cruising the same mean streets the night of the murder but to have ample reason to want his abusive son in law dead  but the embittered loner andrews finds in tierney a summons to his better nature  he tries to exonerate her father while still keeping his own involvement in the whole sordid business a secret     not so epigrammatic as laura  the script for where the sidewalk ends  by ben hecht  shows a pungency of its own  in a second dressing down  his superior tells andrews   look at you   all bunged up like a barrelhouse fag   but while laura spread its attention over half a dozen characters  here andrews is all but the sole focus  even tierneys role is far less central than her half spectral laura   and andrews may never have excelled his performance here  its tight lipped and taciturn  but never more eloquent than when his face is silently registering the anguish to which his own obstinacy has brought him  hes a pent up sufferer who can find release only through the safety valve of violence  he even lashes out against his loyal partner  bert freed   to be sure  he finds too swift a road to redemption though the agency of his beautiful co star  but that was the style of the times  and a sweetened up ending does little to undermine this new york story of violence  corruption and urban entanglements 
"These days Spielberg's ""The Color Purple"" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zilch. What's even more alarming is that Spielberg himself wasn't even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the film-makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded.<br /><br />The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick'.<br /><br />The story is an interesting one, livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but I didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think that Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly deserving and Danny Glover was unaccountably stiffed.<br /><br />As already mentioned, Spielberg didn't receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. Such an omission beggars belief, since Spielberg's direction here is top-notch. I'm not especially crazy about Quincy Jones's score but it's not below average by any means.<br /><br />In the end, the story is a satisfying one, well-told by a master film-maker working from Pulitzer Prize-winning material. Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on Oscar night.",1,these days spielbergs  the color purple  is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch  whats even more alarming is that spielberg himself wasnt even nominated for best director  needless to say  the film makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded  the story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson  whoopi goldberg   an african american woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband  the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celies relationships with the women around her  its told from a decidedly female perspective but you neednt fear that its a saccharine chick flick  the story is an interesting one  livened with humour at times although the central characters struggles are paramount  some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the films end but i didnt mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes  the film received three oscar nominations for acting  whoopi goldberg  best actress   oprah winfrey  best supporting actress  and margaret avery  best supporting actress   i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffed  as already mentioned  spielberg didnt receive a best director nomination for his efforts  such an omission beggars belief  since spielbergs direction here is top notch  im not especially crazy about quincy joness score but its not below average by any means  in the end  the story is a satisfying one  well told by a master film maker working from pulitzer prize winning material  give it a try and youll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night

It empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain, isolation and skewed views of self and others.

"For starters, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series.<br /><br />First of all, the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie film, which is always appreciated.<br /><br />However, there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot.<br /><br />Apart from that, I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. That is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, only-thinking-about-sex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. Also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects.<br /><br />Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley.<br /><br />So, in the end, a generally horrid film, if seen from a critical point of view. If seen from a teen point of view, I guess that it's better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.",0,for starters  i would like to say that im a fan of the american pie series  even though the naked mile and this one are the two worst  this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series  first of all  the best part of the film was that it was an american pie film  which is always appreciated  however  there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film  first of all  the story has a very stale arc structure  first  there is the introduction of the characters  then the pledging of the beta house and finally the greek olympiad  each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length  apart from the general staleness of the plot  there is little to no character development  which makes a double whammy of a bad plot  apart from that  i deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film  that is  showing the jocks as the extremely cool  only thinking about sex guys  and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior  also  it shows females only as sexual objects  and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects  apart from that  the acting was also poor  with perhaps the exception of steve talley  so  in the end  a generally horrid film  if seen from a critical point of view  if seen from a teen point of view  i guess that its better  but this film is rated 18  in most countries  so it shouldnt really be seen by minors 
"I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. Having reserved a special slot for it last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged 17 and a Film Studies student), with chocolates of course, in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin.<br /><br />After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. The shaky camera shots and angles, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. Despondent, we viewed on.<br /><br />Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked oddly and with no particular purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us directly in an almost 'I'll find you' stalking fashion.<br /><br />Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid him well, however, as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall, drenching him and his co-actor. They were nearly swept out to sea. Health and Safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene. Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place.<br /><br />Other than Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head's unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott.<br /><br />Towards the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being. In contrast, Anne ran, hyper-ventilating, from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who, in the meantime, had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told, in the course of only three or four minutes, without even having worked up a sweat.<br /><br />We experienced none of Anne's charms crossing the screen. Indeed, we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain, spineless, opinion-less Anne and why someone, anyone, did not tell mean, winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up.<br /><br />The crucial kiss, normally our favourite girlie moment, was painfully drawn out. As they moved in closer, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met. Eww! <br /><br />The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been.<br /><br />What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of England's finest scenery.<br /><br />Sorry Jane.",0,i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas  having reserved a special slot for it last night  i sat down to watch it with my daughter  aged 17 and a film studies student   with chocolates of course  in eager anticipation  we love jane austin  after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk  the shaky camera shots and angles  general poor cinematography  direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied  despondent  we viewed on  anne  played by sally hawkins  looked oddly and with no particular purpose  directly at the camera on several occasions  breaking our hard won fantasy of the moment and engaging us directly in an almost ill find you stalking fashion  poor rupert penry jones  who played captain wentworth  did his best with the script and direction  bless him  i hope they paid him well  however  as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall  drenching him and his co actor  they were nearly swept out to sea  health and safety would have had a field day  poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line  presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene  anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place  other than mr  penry jones  alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony heads unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott  towards the long awaited end of the film  captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie  it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being  in contrast  anne ran  hyper ventilating  from pillar to post in search of the good captain who  in the meantime  had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told  in the course of only three or four minutes  without even having worked up a sweat  we experienced none of annes charms crossing the screen  indeed  we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain  spineless  opinion less anne and why someone  anyone  did not tell mean  winging sir walter to just shut the heck up  the crucial kiss  normally our favourite girlie moment  was painfully drawn out  as they moved in closer  anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met  eww   the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been  what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story  filmed in some of englands finest scenery  sorry jane 
"It pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so I'm simply encouraging these people. First off, just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing. In fact in this case, the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits. Have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre? Ever heard people laugh and thought ""what the dickens are you on""? Well even these twats weren't laughing.

Much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters, and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing. All the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this movie to casting agents. Watch the first few scenes and then find something better, or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess. I found this in a bin at a video store.

"WOW! <br /><br />This film is the best living testament, I think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in NYC, compared to anything shown by the major media outlets.<br /><br />Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside. This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE. <br /><br />It begins with a focus on a rookie New York fireman, waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight. The subject matter turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE TO HIT THE TOWERS. You are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene, into the lobby of Tower One. <br /><br />In the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane, and Tower Two's subsequent fall, you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby. It is a sight you will not soon forget.<br /><br />Heart-rending, tear-jerking, and very compelling from the first minute to the last, ""9/11"" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made.<br /><br />We must never forget.<br /><br />",1,wow   this film is the best living testament  i think  of what happened on 9 11 01 in nyc  compared to anything shown by the major media outlets  those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside  this film shows you what happened on the inside   it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman  waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight  the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers  you are then given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene  into the lobby of tower one   in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane  and tower twos subsequent fall  you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby  it is a sight you will not soon forget  heart rending  tear jerking  and very compelling from the first minute to the last   9 11  deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made  we must never forget 
"Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: ""To Have and To Have Not"" (1944) and ""The Big Sleep"" (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but I think through no fault of her own. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper-crust lady. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no Spaniard. It was hard to keep straight which country people were from.<br /><br />I really liked the black and white cinematography. Mood is used to great affect - I especially liked the fog scene. The lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.<br /><br />Bacall is just gorgeous. Boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and Bacall together was a little strange. Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really liked this picture. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. I must say I found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film.<br /><br />Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing. Lorre also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of Conteras - a sleazy coward to the end.

"There is no reason to see this movie. A good plot idea is handled very badly. In the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense. The reason for the killings are not made clear. The acting is awful. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in In the Bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy, has to change her character someday. Even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed. Even though the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this one),there are no deleted scenes in the DVD which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters.<br /><br />Don't spend the time on this one.",0,there is no reason to see this movie  a good plot idea is handled very badly  in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense  the reason for the killings are not made clear  the acting is awful  nick stahl obviously needs a better director  he was excellent in in the bedroom  but here he is terrible  amber benson from buffy  has to change her character someday  even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed  even though the movie was 80 minutes  which is too short for a good movie  but too long for this one  there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters  dont spend the time on this one 
"A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe) as best actor. Let's take the second point first.<br /><br />Is Anthony John Colman's greatest role, or even his signature role? I have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles. Most of his career, Ronald Colman played decent gentlemen, frequently in dangerous or atypical situations. He is Bulldog Drummond (cleaned up in the Goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist) fighting crime. He is Raffles, the great cricket player and even greater burglar, trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend's honor. He is Robert Conway, the great imperial political figure, who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth, Shangri-La. He is Dick Heldar, manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist. I can add Sidney Carton and Rudolf Rassendyll to this list. But here he is not heroic. In fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others. It does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-social.<br /><br />To me Colman should have gotten the Oscar for Heldar, or Carton, or Conway - all more typical of his acting roles. But the Academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it's treasure to it's leading members. Colman's Anthony John is a very good performance, and at one point truly scary. When alone with Signe Hasso in her home, she at the top of a staircase and him at the base, they have an argument. She demands that ""Tony"" leave, saying she won't see him. He stares at her, his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before, and he says, ""Oh, no you won't!"" He starts moving upstairs, frightening Hasso, and she runs into her room. He stops himself and leaves. It actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of Hasso on stage, or of Edmond O'Brien, or his killing of Shelley Winters. It showed his blind fury. For that moment it was (to me) an Oscar-worthy performance. But it is only that moment. I'm glad he was recognized for the role, but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance.<br /><br />His actual performance in the Shakespearian role of Othello is not great, but bearable. Too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style (one wonders if that was due to the coaching of Walter Hampden, who probably knew how to handle the role properly, or a reaction to it). Nowadays ""Othello"" is played by an African American actor more frequently than a white one. Paul Robeson's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place. But the three best known movie performances of the part are those of Colman, Orson Welles in his movie of OTHELLO, and Laurence Olivier in his movie of his play production of OTHELLO. All three white actors did the role in black face. My personal favorite of the three is Welles, who seems the most subtle. But even watching Welles' fine film version makes me angry that Robeson never got to put his performance (with Jose Ferrer as Iago) on film.<br /><br />Now the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role? I heard different things about this. Some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set. Others have found a role they have to be stimulating, influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life. But actually I have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role. It seems a melodramatic, hackneyed idea.<br /><br />As a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with Cukor, Kanin, and Gordon. In 1944 a ""B"" feature, THE BRIGHTON STRANGLER, starring John Loder, had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous ""Jack the Ripper"" type, and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind. There was an earlier movie in the 1930s, in which an actor playing Othello gets jealous of his wife (I think the title was MEN ARE NOT GODS, but I'm not sure). But due to Colman's name and career, and Cukor's directing, it is A DOUBLE LIFE that people think of when they recall this plot idea. It even reached comedy (finally) on an episode of CHEERS, where Diane Chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent, and they put on OTHELLO at the bar, just after he sees her with Sam Malone kissing. Only Diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict, and can't delay the production long enough (she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play). <br /><br />The cast of A DOUBLE LIFE was first rate, and Cukor's direction was as sure as ever. So the film is definitely worth watching.

"It's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star. Prior to watching The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.<br /><br />There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers. Even more so in that the ""carefully crafted"" (or however they put it) conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally I can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers), and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.<br /><br />It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die-hard Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience. If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead.

"Chris Gerolmo took care not to simply give us a `Jack-the-stripper' type of list of murdered people: he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results. Perhaps mostly due to Stephen Rea's excellent performance playing off against Donald Sutherland with good empathy by both. It was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of Rostov. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, carried out their parts really well. Good directing. The photography was good too. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations, but, frankly, given the depth of the story-telling and interpretations, we can completely forget these little trivialia.<br /><br />For once, a made for TV film from HBO has come up trumps. Recommended, especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes  which, I hasten to add, are never exaggerated.",1,chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a  jack the stripper type of list of murdered people  he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results  perhaps mostly due to stephen reas excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both  it was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov  supporting actors  especially max von sydow  carried out their parts really well  good directing  the photography was good too  needless to say  the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations  but  frankly  given the depth of the story telling and interpretations  we can completely forget these little trivialia  for once  a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps  recommended  especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes  which  i hasten to add  are never exaggerated

"This is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative. It lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection.<br /><br />The animation is well done but I feel like it is too presentational. I would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me.<br /><br />But for a Hollywood style film it works OK but it is very derivative of Aardman films and this is bothering to me. Perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice-over.<br /><br />I think the voice over is too glib.",0,this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative  it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection  the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational  i would have preferred more images from behind  more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me  but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me  perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice over  i think the voice over is too glib

"This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more...and they're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />Equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television.<br /><br />The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos.

"A year after losing gorgeous Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) to love rival Tarzan, hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe's heart. Mixing business with pleasure, he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the Mutia escarpment, Tarzan's stomping ground.<br /><br />Accompanied by his slimy, womanising pal Martin Arlington and a group of expendable bearers, Harry finally arrives at his destination (having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock-hurling apes) only to find that Jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller, and worse still, that Tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard.<br /><br />Nasty Arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape-man and then telling Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan isn't deadonly wounded; after being nursed back to health by Cheetah (!), he swings back into action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who have attacked Holt's expedition.<br /><br />Tarzan And His Mate, the second movie to star Weismuller as the jungle man of few words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series; although I slightly prefer the original, I can definitely understand the film's popularity: it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences! The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes, and with both stars wearing eensy-weensy outfits throughout, there's eye-candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy (despite O'Sullivan's much-touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double, the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin, even threatening to do a 'Sharon Stone' at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side!).<br /><br />The film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between Tarzan and a crocodile, and the spectacular finalé where Jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is rescued by her beau, his monkey pals, and a load of elephants in full-on lion-crushing mode (once again, the violence is surprisingly nasty at times, although as far as I am concerned, there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film). Cheetah also has his fair share of excitement, dodging rhinos, crocs, and big cats, riding on Tarzan's back as he crosses a river, and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride.<br /><br />Like it's predecessor, Tarzan And His Mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing propsdodgy back projection, a few laughable monkey suits, more Indian elephants masquerading as their African cousins, and poorly disguised trapeze swingsbut these shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film.

"I found this show really late at night, and gave it a try. It's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night, if you catch my drift. Its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children. It's something I indulge in whenever I find it on (which is rare, maybe I should actually check the listings! haha)..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute. Like any good chick flick, you really get emotionally involved in the characters. Good ol' Louisa May Alcott still inspiring good stories :) So apparently I must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid, so I guess I'll tell you a bit more. The kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are lovely and nature-filled -- another thing you don't see much on television. I hope everyone gives it a shot.

Like I said before, it's refreshing.",1,i found this show really late at night  and gave it a try  its a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night  if you catch my drift  its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children  its something i indulge in whenever i find it on  which is rare  maybe i should actually check the listings  haha       and the tension between joe and nick is so cute  like any good chick flick  you really get emotionally involved in the characters  good ol louisa may alcott still inspiring good stories    so apparently i must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid  so i guess ill tell you a bit more  the kids are played by talented actors and actresses  and the settings are lovely and nature filled    another thing you dont see much on television  i hope everyone gives it a shot  i recognize and am fully aware that its sappy  but its good heart  like i said before  its refreshing 
"After a quasi-Gothic, all-fruity music video, the movie starts with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself. In a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll. We don't live n that world. The insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence. When I say clown, I mean actual clown. He tell them they're all going to die via Cassidy's ghost (the spirit possesses Dora, one of the band-mates) We couldn't care less as the characters are all boring, vapid, and extremely horribly acted. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who after The attendant, and Tower of blood, HAS to know that he keeps making crap for a living), this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake. Not enough blood to appease gore-hounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs. This movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway gets topless <br /><br />Where i saw it: Starz on Demand",0,after a quasi gothic  all fruity music video  the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself  in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll  we dont live n that world  the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence  when i say clown  i mean actual clown  he tell them theyre all going to die via cassidys ghost  the spirit possesses dora  one of the band mates  we couldnt care less as the characters are all boring  vapid  and extremely horribly acted  written by adam hackbarth  an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one   and directed by corbin timbrook  who after the attendant  and tower of blood  has to know that he keeps making crap for a living   this movie s a constant battle between the films incompetence and the viewers need to stay awake  not enough blood to appease gore hounds  nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs  this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone  my grade  f  eye candy  amanda carraway gets topless  where i saw it  starz on demand

"WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 -- Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /><br />Kane vs. MVP in an Inferno match: So this is the fourth ever inferno match in the WWE and it is Kane vs. MVP (wonder why was it the first match on the card). I only viewed the ending parts where Kane sets MVP's ass on fire as they're on the apron and then MVP is running around the arena while yelling  eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as MVP sprawls around the entrance ramp. Funny and visually quite entertaining ending. 7/10<br /><br />WWE Tag Team Championship: This was originally supposed to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c) in a regular tag team match. However, GM Teddy Long comes to the ring and announces that it's going to be a Fatal 4-way tag team ladder match. MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and it's all chaos. One word to describe this eye-opener  wow. Man, I really can't remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words can't really do it justice. There was one particularly notable spot where The Hardys set up a ladder in a see-saw position and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held MNM for the kill, and then WHAM! Nitro blew away while Mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the match alone. Another spot was when Jeff powerbombed London while FLIPPING off the ladder. There were other high-flying breathtaking spots too many to remember. London finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show-stealer. 8.5/10<br /><br />The Boogeyman vs. The Miz: The two men get thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit-out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over The Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5/10 for this three-minute incognito.<br /><br />United States championship: Chris Benoit (c) faces off Chavo Guerrero in yet another typical Guerrero match. Some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by Chavo and an unusually long chain of German suplexes by Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail Benoit but Benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to go for a roll-up but Benoit rolls it up once more and Chavo is locked in the Sharpshooter. Game over. Nice hard-fought battle albeit slow at times. 7/10<br /><br />WWE Cruiserweight championship: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this one, in a fairly moderate-paced match. The match had some good high-flying spots  most notably Helms' moves off the top rope  but the crowd didn't seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match, and Yang needs to get more airborne. Helms won the match after blowing Yang away with a facebuster on the knee. 7.5/10<br /><br />The Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride match: After a series of matches between these two, this time it is a Last Ride match, the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse. Pretty good indeed for what these two could offer. Kennedy manhandled a good deal of Taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw Taker off the Armageddon set about 15 feet below; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would've been brutal. Kennedy almost got the win until Taker got back up inside the hearse (I liked the camera view inside the hearse). Taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on Kennedy and broke the hearse's window instead, but then later busted Kennedy open with a chair, and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and Tombstone on the hearse's roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win. I actually found myself really interested into these guys' willingness to take/give real sick shots. 7.5/10<br /><br />Santa comes into the ring, I go ""what the hell?"" like many of the kids in the crowd, and then the word ""lingerie contest"" gets in my ear. Break time.<br /><br />Batista & John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker: talk about charisma vs. technicality. This match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense. Even Finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time (I kind of doubted his strength against the champs), and him and Booker mainly didn't succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where Booker rammed his scepter into Cena's throat. Batista hits the Bomb on Booker for the win, didn't get to see the F-U; Cena performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyhow and I think he also did the STFU. This was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7.5/10.<br /><br />Being an on-and-off WWE fan, I have to agree that Armageddon was laced up with numerous eye-catchers throughout, and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show; the Last Ride match featured some fairly nerve-wrenching spots, and the main event also did very well for its category. All other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the Boogeyman vs. The Miz bout and the ever-useless lingerie contest. Overall Armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes this year's goodbye respectably.

"This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.",0,this film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes  the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking  through the jungle  up a rocky cliff  near a river or lake  to pad out the running time  the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging  bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb  eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing  gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras  for a zombie cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didnt see an uncut version 
"Personally I would advise people to stay clear of this movie. It's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing.

I cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to.<br /><br />Overall, when it comes to Movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid any films that contains the word 'Ninja'.",0,personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie  its on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed  slow and not very convincing  if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie  then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio commentary  but in any case  since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching  i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to  overall  when it comes to movies  i have one golden rule  avoid any films that contains the word ninja 
"Went to see the movie ""Troy"" this afternoon. Here's what I learned:<br /><br />Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not gay. EVER. This was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter. So it is safe for American dudes to see this movie.<br /><br />Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which, though numerous, were probably all filmed on the same day, one after the other, with the director saying, ""Alright, now look beautiful . . . good ... OK, now look frightened ... good... now look depressed ... good ... now look interested . . . good ... now look beautiful again ... good...""<br /><br />Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents couldn't act.<br /><br />Trojans looked just like Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does not blink on camera.<br /><br />Helen of Troy's biggest line was, ""They're coming for me.""<br /><br />Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way up.<br /><br />Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but it's OK. They were cousins. Never mind what history says.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole can tell an entire story with just an expression.<br /><br />Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in drag.<br /><br />Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, much like American men.<br /><br />All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor.<br /><br />Troy had only three women.<br /><br />There were lots of blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have really stuck out.<br /><br />Despite their coastal desert locale, Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like.<br /><br />British actors look silly with Greek hairdos.<br /><br />Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes.<br /><br />Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable.<br /><br />Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts.<br /><br />Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins, even back when they were all new.",0,went to see the movie  troy  this afternoon  heres what i learned  contrary to popular opinion and history in general  greek men were not gay  ever  this was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter  so it is safe for american dudes to see this movie  helen of troy always had impeccable hair and makeup  she looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which  though numerous  were probably all filmed on the same day  one after the other  with the director saying   alright  now look beautiful       good     ok  now look frightened     good    now look depressed     good     now look interested       good     now look beautiful again     good     most greek and trojan men had british accents  those with american accents couldnt act  trojans looked just like greeks  but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen  brad pitt does not blink on camera  helen of troys biggest line was   theyre coming for me   trojan music sounded remarkably like modern bulgarian music  brad pitts thighs go all the way up  achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close  but its ok  they were cousins  never mind what history says  peter otoole can tell an entire story with just an expression  trojan gods apparently all had greek names  but their statues either looked egyptian or like peter otoole in drag  greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting  much like american men  all of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color    light egyptian  by max factor  troy had only three women  there were lots of blond greeks  which is good news for brad pitt  who would otherwise have really stuck out  despite their coastal desert locale  greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires  funeral pyres  trojan horses and the like  british actors look silly with greek hairdos  brad pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes  greek soldiers fought constantly  but their outfits always looked impeccable  greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts  apparently greek temples were always in ruins  even back when they were all new 
"This rubbish excuse for television is the single most god-awful piece of trash ever to hit Australian television. The house-mates are dull, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them. As far as I am concerned Big Brother is the decline of western society, showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain-dead morons. Whatever happened to television that didn't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? This cannot be classified as entertainment. I think that it true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus who was once a respectable comedian and, once moving to Channel 10, become horribly unfunny. With the exception of The Simpsons which is highly intelligently made.",0,this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television  the house mates are dull  uninteresting  ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them  as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society  showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain dead morons  whatever happened to television that didnt target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience  this cannot be classified as entertainment  i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul  it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and  once moving to channel 10  become horribly unfunny  with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made 
"This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.",0,this film had a lot of promise  and the plot was relatively interesting  however the actors  director and editors seriously let this film down  i feel bad for the writers  it could have been good  the acting is wooden  very few of the characters are believable  who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film  there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying  i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no  it left me feeling like id wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money

"When I saw this movie first, it was long ago on VHS-Video. I did like this movie, because it was funny and excitingly. Some years ago I saw another movie, called: *Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure* In this movie were parts of *Wizards of the lost kingdom* used in. They called this movie ""KOR the conquerer"". I began to search for the ""KOR""-Movie many years, because I wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the *Andy Colby*-Movie. No shop had this Kor-Movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS-tapes I had at home, and what a wonder... I had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time in watching *KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great during the hole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunken through the green forrest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their job very good. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.

"This is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller I've ever seen. Oh....where to start....<br /><br />Plot (what little there is): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant. Clay has been secretly engaged to his mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. On the night that these two secretly get married, it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found. Go and figure the odds of that one! Once on the operating table, Clay finds out the anesthesia isn't working, and he can feel everything and hear everything.<br /><br />Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha, which we are told he's doing through an annoying voice-over which never seems to stop.<br /><br />If you didn't burst out in laughter yet, you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes. <br /><br />How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon, one nurse, an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is too preposterous to be taken seriously...the operating room isn't even kept sterile...people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up... During the operation the viewer gets to hear Clay's thoughts, none of which are too fascinating. Ah...but here's what it's all about ...the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money. Believing him to be unconscious, the villains speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? <br /><br />Well... at least there's no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery. Not even Clay's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status. The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha...but oh no...could sweet Sam be in on it....You'll quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialog...<br /><br />In the end, it wouldn't even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness, because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.<br /><br />If you can ignore the feeling that the director/writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness, maybe there's some dumb fun to be had...<br /><br />Enjoy...",0,this is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller ive ever seen  oh    where to start     plot  what little there is   clayton beresford jr   hayden christensen   a young billionaire  with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant  clay has been secretly engaged to his mothers pa  samantha  played by jessica alba  on the night that these two secretly get married  it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found  go and figure the odds of that one  once on the operating table  clay finds out the anesthesia isnt working  and he can feel everything and hear everything  fortunately clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of samantha  which we are told hes doing through an annoying voice over which never seems to stop  if you didnt burst out in laughter yet  you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes   how could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon  one nurse  an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist  there were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled  not to mention the medical behavior  which is too preposterous to be taken seriously   the operating room isnt even kept sterile   people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up    during the operation the viewer gets to hear clays thoughts  none of which are too fascinating  ah   but heres what its all about    the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money  believing him to be unconscious  the villains speak freely  gosh  what will happen   well    at least theres no interference from anyone else in the hospital  while an incompetent doctor whos got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery  not even clays overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status  the only one interested in keeping updated is samantha   but oh no   could sweet sam be in on it    youll quickly find out through some scooby doo dialog    in the end  it wouldnt even matter whether or not clay underwent anesthesia awareness  because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases  if you can ignore the feeling that the director writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness  maybe theres some dumb fun to be had    enjoy   
"A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. It could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon's. John Livien's suicida mother's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed Lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a God instead a man. I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another ""crazy"" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer , Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory,by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. It ruined the movie completely for me . It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie.",0,a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom  it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john liviens traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche  instead  it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john liviens life with john lennons  john liviens suicida mothers hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself  instead of focusing on john lennons musical brilliance  and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life  it showed lennons legacy to be that of a confused  drug addicted soul  who should looked upon as a god instead a man  i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another  crazy  person obsessed with lennon  lennons killer   mark david chapman  lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon  do we need to be reminded of that  john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person  as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon  and not show his beautiful contributions to the world  yoko ono graciously honored john lennons memory by making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects  and remember john  instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide  i found this so disturbing and disrespectful to lennons memory  he was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death  and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any lennon fan  it ruined the movie completely for me   it could have been a decent movie  but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth  let john lennon  and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie 
"Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X--a powerful force to be used for atomic power. Unfortunately Rukh has been contaminated by the Radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote--but Rukh starts to go mad due to the Radium AND the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him.<br /><br />The plot is silly and the ""effects"" that make Karloff glow in the dark are laughable, but this is still a fun little chiller. It moves quickly, has some great atmosphere (notice Rukh's ""house"" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There is also good acting by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's OK but just a notch below all the other Karloff/Lugosi movies. The plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. Still I did like this. I give it a 7.",1,prof  janos rukh  boris karloff  discovers radium x  a powerful force to be used for atomic power  unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark  and his touch causes instant death  dr  felix benet  bela lugosi  develops an antidote  but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him  the plot is silly and the  effects  that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable  but this is still a fun little chiller  it moves quickly  has some great atmosphere  notice rukhs  house  and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night  and karloff and lugosi  as always  give great performances  there is also good acting by franic drake  as rukhs wife  and violet kemble cooper  as his mother   so its ok but just a notch below all the other karloff lugosi movies  the plot is just too far fetched for me to swallow  still i did like this  i give it a 7 
"Yes, as the other reviewers have already stated, this may not be vintage L&H but it's far from being their worst work as at 20th Century Stupid...I mean Fox. This film certainly has all of the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys. But it's their serious approach and determination that makes them funny. They don't play it for laughs as other comedians might but they take their work and situation quite seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they are faced with some basic issues that really might be encountered by any one of us today, namely job related stress. First, we would get checked out by a doctor and he would prescribe some much needed rest and perhaps staying by the sea. That's where the surrealness comes in to all of this. L&H always take a most plausible set of circumstances and exaggerate it but never to the point of being incredible, except maybe once in awhile. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their self caused predicaments and attempts at extrication. That's what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film all those ingredients are presented in a delightfully artful and gracefully slapstick way. Not their best in comparison to their earlier work probably because this was the actual last film they did for Roach because he wanted to mirror the ""big"" studios and go into making features exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligation. BIG MISTAKE! They should have all stayed together and continued for maybe five more years. What the world may have missed in their not considering this as an option.

"How can't you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but History! This is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that! What a moment!

"There seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology, which is extremely flawed. It simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis, which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe.<br /><br />Journalism 101: tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable. for instance, the idea of civil war, chaos, looting, etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following Hussein's demise: were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture? doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself, rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure? would they rather the US have declared marshall law? i'm sure the papers here would've exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force.<br /><br />aside from the analytical idiocy of the film, it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming ""so-and-so refused to be interviewed..."" yet the questions they would've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received. would you, as vice president, deign to be interviewed by a first time writer/producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words. they couldn't roll tape of Condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions, perhaps they never watched her hearing.<br /><br />this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there. this is another biased, asinine approach by journalists - which are, by and large, unthinking herds.<br /><br />anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN commentary. these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think.",0,there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology  which is extremely flawed  it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis  which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe  journalism 101  tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable  for instance  the idea of civil war  chaos  looting  etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following husseins demise  were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture  doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself  rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure  would they rather the us have declared marshall law  im sure the papers here wouldve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force  aside from the analytical idiocy of the film  it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming  so and so refused to be interviewed     yet the questions they wouldve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received  would you  as vice president  deign to be interviewed by a first time writer producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words  they couldnt roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions  perhaps they never watched her hearing  this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there  this is another biased  asinine approach by journalists   which are  by and large  unthinking herds  anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary  these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think 
"Normally, I am a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film I have to say it was incredibly bad. I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.<br /><br />There were some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. It might have worked if ""Daggers"" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. This may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word ""flirt"" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, I was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly I just cringed a lot.<br /><br />*******spoiler*****<br /><br />Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones I have ever seen. The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. Wow, cool.<br /><br />Well, then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank. I, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling. Not a good sign.<br /><br />Visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.",0,normally  i am a pretty generous critic  but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad  i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be  there were some gorgeous shots  but its too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie  it might have worked if  daggers  was purely an action flick and not a romance  but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle  there is no chemistry between either of the couples  whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love  and for the most part the dialogue is just silly  this may be just a problem with translation  but the frequent usage of the word  flirt  in particular reminded me of 8th grade  not head over heels  together forever  worth dying for love  i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor  the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about  and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole  i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward  i was slumped in my seat ready to snore  but mostly i just cringed a lot         spoiler      now  the icing on the cake  or rather  adding insult to injury  the ending was truly one of the most horrible  laughable ones i have ever seen  the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other  oh  and then it starts to snow  randomly  oh  and then mei  dagger embedded in heart  suddenly pops up out of the weeds  then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination  even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet  wow  cool  well  then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death  jin sings  sobs  holds her body close  screen goes blank  i  and the people surrounding me  are chuckling  not a good sign  visually stunning  but ultimately a failure 
"The premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull.<br /><br />SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it. Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. It was dull and boring.<br /><br />With some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good.",0,the premise of this movie was decent enough  but with sub par acting  it was just bland and dull  spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death  it was accidental  so although it was a murder it wasnt like the guy set out to do it  also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree  there is no emotion in this film  the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister  and hearing her message  it was dull and boring  with some polishing  and better acting it could have been pretty good 
"Watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked it. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. As they look through the diary, they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom. What they find out, is something completely different, and horrifying to say the least. I like low-budget horror films, that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way, and tell a good story. This movie does just that, despite taking a while to get going. The result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the ride. Not a lot of gore, but that wouldn't fit the story, although the gore it has is pretty good.",1,watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it  the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier  somehow without leaving his cell  as they look through the diary  they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom  what they find out  is something completely different  and horrifying to say the least  i like low budget horror films  that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way  and tell a good story  this movie does just that  despite taking a while to get going  the result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me  and i enjoyed the ride  not a lot of gore  but that wouldnt fit the story  although the gore it has is pretty good 
"Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 best. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.<br /><br />The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. The narration by Michael Caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself.<br /><br />Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a Maradona fan.",1,of all the football films i have watched  this is one of the 2 best  the other being fever pitch  but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup  diego maradona  this story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time  the musical score is evocative and the images are powerful  the narration by michael caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic  this story is not about the individual games of the world cup  rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself  exciting games like france v brazil  one of the greatest games of all time   were covered in the same vein  the final argentin v w germany was also in the same vein  highly recommended  a classic of world football  to be watched over and over again  esp if youre a maradona fan 
"On an overnight flight from Los Angeles to Miami, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die.<br /><br />Red Eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The premise is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth but Red Eye is better than both of those films. Almost everything about Red Eye is above average including the suspense, the acting and the direction. Most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie. The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots. Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on the thrills, he focuses on the story and the characters. The movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about. I also like the way Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on. Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling.<br /><br />Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast. Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate. You may even end up cheering for her out loud. Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain. The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive. The supporting actors are also pretty good which include Brain Cox and Jayma Mays.<br /><br />The movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it. The setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape. Overall, the tone of the film is consistently creepy. The screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though. There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer. Most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head. Also, the ending is disappointing. It isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better. Since the movie focuses on the characters, there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps. If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed. In the end, Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer.

"Jet Li, is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world. He has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the US.<br /><br />Black Mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him, but it fails horribly. First of all, it is dubbed. While it may have camp value (the dubbing isn't even close and it is flat in tone), it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer. Secondly, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, at times, you don't know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans see Jet Li's movies for the fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so fast that you don't even know who's who half the time! Other times, a scene is left hanging (ie Li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the badguys arm their guns, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are so improbable, that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous (killer CD roms? Just give him Throwing Stars!!!!). Li, needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise-a-scene. The added rap/techno music goes from being okay to intrusive. The plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for. And are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask on? Wouldn't the hair, lower jaw, or voice give it away?<br /><br />If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin Temple.

"I'm not sure if Carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion, and make the really heavy-handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if Satan is the father, but it drags on and on. Ron Perlman is laughable. The baby is really stupid looking, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. You can pretty much see the material on the Satan costume. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of tedium. Very, very bad. And the ending is just ridiculous.

"Criminally Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan's Black Wedding/Criminally Insane, and it's a good thing too, because when I've seen a movie and know there's a sequel (especially something that's as obscure as this) I'm always curious. I've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again. Most of CI2 is nothing but ""flashbacks"" to CI, and footage of Ethel asleep, recalling fond memories, I guess. Thanks to Proposition 13 she's released from Napa State (wonder if she got to see The Cramps play while she was there?) and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that Ethel promptly takes to calling ""granny"". This is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic, and it's even complete with a couple of ""rolls"". Of course Ethel does her thing, which is to dispatch anyone between her and food, especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert. Also, you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. Guess that's all a matter of misguided ""trust"". If you liked or disliked Criminally Insane, either way there's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity. One wonders why the makers of this even bothered. 2 out of 10.",0,criminally insane 2 is included on the new dvd of satans black wedding criminally insane  and its a good thing too  because when ive seen a movie and know theres a sequel  especially something thats as obscure as this  im always curious  ive now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again  most of ci2 is nothing but  flashbacks  to ci  and footage of ethel asleep  recalling fond memories  i guess  thanks to proposition 13 shes released from napa state  wonder if she got to see the cramps play while she was there   and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that ethel promptly takes to calling  granny   this is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic  and its even complete with a couple of  rolls   of course ethel does her thing  which is to dispatch anyone between her and food  especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert  also  you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink  guess thats all a matter of misguided  trust   if you liked or disliked criminally insane  either way theres no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity  one wonders why the makers of this even bothered  2 out of 10 
"Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. It is a simple movie told very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. The cast is all terrific. I wish they had never made sequel after sequel. The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!",1,halloween is one of the best examples of independent film  its very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance  it is a simple movie told very well  the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores    if you havent seen this movie yet  you must check it out  the cast is all terrific  i wish they had never made sequel after sequel  the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel  it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie  she hasnt seemed to age  shes just as gorgeous today  without the hairdo and seventies clothes   the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever 
"I am a huge fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The last samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is absolutely awesome, and which i strongly recommend, i had high expectations from a Sergei Bodrov movie. But it was terrible, awful, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen, but it didn't, then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end, but even that was a huge disappointment, just some random running around, waving with the swords...

"Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments.",1,another comment about this film made it sound lousy  given talking pictures were so new   i think the script and acting were good  davis was so young and fresh  she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect  yet it is great to see her this way   still learning the craft  so many clichés came from this film and it seems  this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years  my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was  keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture  for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight   i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments 
"War Inc. is a funny but strange film. The actors are likable, the film is likable also, but I don't know how to describe the plot. I will go into the plot later on. This is a movie with some weird casting choices. Besides John Cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in Grosse Point blank which I liked. <br /><br />Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is odd. There is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants. And hits on Hauser(Cusack). There is a twist in the end involving the two characters. It makes sense.<br /><br />That is the only casting choice I am going into. Cause it just plain strange. The whole movie is strange. But at times incredibly funny and I was never bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Excluding Miss Duff. She ain't great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean?<br /><br />This is the story of a hit-man named Hauser(Cusack). He is sent down to some Middle Eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named Omar Sheriif(not the actor). While trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help out the wedding of a popstar(played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter(played by Marisa Tomeii). There is a thing about the popstar though. Hauser is disgusted by her. There is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up.<br /><br />The twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why. The thing about the twist is that I did kind of see it coming. But that doesn't matter. This is a strange, funny, and entertaining comedy. I love most of the actors. So really, how could I not recommend it?<br /><br />War,Inc.:3.5/5",1,war inc  is a funny but strange film  the actors are likable  the film is likable also  but i dont know how to describe the plot  i will go into the plot later on  this is a movie with some weird casting choices  besides john cusack as a hit man  which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked   here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that  her character is odd  there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants  and hits on hauser cusack   there is a twist in the end involving the two characters  it makes sense  that is the only casting choice i am going into  cause it just plain strange  the whole movie is strange  but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored  here we have some of the best actors out there  excluding miss duff  she aint great  but here we have john cusack  marisa tomeii  joan cusack  ben kingsley  see what i mean  this is the story of a hit man named hauser cusack   he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif not the actor   while trying to deal with his own personal problems  he has to help out the wedding of a popstar played by hilary duff   and he falls in love with a news reporter played by marisa tomeii   there is a thing about the popstar though  hauser is disgusted by her  there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up  the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why  the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming  but that doesnt matter  this is a strange  funny  and entertaining comedy  i love most of the actors  so really  how could i not recommend it  war inc  3 5 5
"- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.",0,  i had planned to write something explaining what i didnt like about this movie  but this is going to be more difficult than i thought  honestly  i cant remember much about it  i watched it just three days ago and its made almost no impression on me  thats usually the sign of a real stinker  about the only thing i remember was being incredibly bored by most of it  the novelty of having a humphrey bogart look a like as the detective wore off real quick  it would be different if he could act  but hes a one note entertainer  the kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them  if you cant spot the killer five minutes into the movie  you need to see more euro horror  the casting is a dead giveaway to the killers identity 
"This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great. Sure, ""CHAOS"" and ""INSIDE MAN"" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found ""CHAOS"" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and ""Chaos"" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. <br /><br />It's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. <br /><br />Watch it if nothing else is on T.V., but you'll probably get bored with after awhile.",0,this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great  sure   chaos  and  inside man  are literally the same movie  just with variations in suspense  but i found  chaos  more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film  swordfish   the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and  chaos  was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters  but has yet to find a distributor in the u k  and u s a   its true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films  but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch   watch it if nothing else is on t v   but youll probably get bored with after awhile 
"I just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget, now my take on things.<br /><br />The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films.<br /><br />As for the acting Beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where.<br /><br />The script seemed confused to me. One minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not say it should be all 'ye' and 'that it be' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person.<br /><br />I did notice one part near the start when Beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents.<br /><br />In short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but a turn none the less.",0,i just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget  now my take on things  the cgi monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way  the fight scenes werent even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all  when the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro  in my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets  they may not look as fancy but at least they interact  just look at peter jacksons early films  as for the acting beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where  the script seemed confused to me  one minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club shakespeare speech  im not say it should be all ye and that it be but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person  i did notice one part near the start when beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents  in short  this film is a very slightly polished turd  but a turn none the less

"Saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film). Really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always a hoot.

This was raunchy and crude, but thank god! Unless you're a prude, I heartily recommend this movie.

Anyone over the age of, say, nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out.<br /><br />To say this movie is bad is like saying the Holocaust was a little mistake. There are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this ""film"" truly is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse.

"For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls, think again. There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread. His universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match with the famous European breads. The show is as wacky as they come and I'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes. But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show. <br /><br />In the world of Yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread.

His lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next emergance of a young Denzel Washington when the line ""My bus!! It's.... Gone"" That was the true turning point of the movie. My Grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends.

"""Written on the Wind"" is a Douglas Sirk's melodrama. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by the ""Cahiers du Cinema"", Fassbinder etc.. that hailed him as a master director - I think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography - ""Written on the Wind"" offers luscious color images and gorgeous decors. But I ask myself: Is this enough to carry a film? The acting in ""Written on the Wind"" ranges from weak to fair (excepting Robert Stack - he is convincing as the weak & spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, normally a powerful presence in the screen, is miscast in this film. Dorothy Malone as the seductress, the care-free ""femme fatale"" is OK, but she lacks the strength for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient but vapid .<br /><br />The plot has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /><br />A rigid patriarch <br /><br />his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by the disappointed father) <br /><br />his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone)<br /><br />Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman of principles, formerly a secretary and now married to Kyle <br /><br />Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought up together with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /><br />Secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death etc. - well, when I read the story summary on the back cover of the DVD I thought that I was in for a treat. My mistake! Why? I'll try to explain: ""Written on the Wind"" takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before the acting, in general, is not good enough - the intensity is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors just do an efficient job. I think that maybe with Italian or Spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully - they would end (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears .<br /><br />What remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of Douglas Sirk. For me this is not enough.

"Though I really didn't feel anything for Lance's character, and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else. It could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development, perhaps with Lance- I would have liked it better.<br /><br />However, I have to completely agree with DoyleLuver, when they said ""And to quote Glenn Quinn's character Ben: 'I'm the star here in it, that's right I'm the talented one!'"" If you watch the movie, just watch him, even when he's in the background... just his facial expressions, all in the eyes, you KNOW for sure what motivates Ben, exactly how he feels about comments, even if it's a quick look behind a character's back. Great acting in a fair film.",1,though i really didnt feel anything for lances character  and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else  it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development  perhaps with lance  i would have liked it better  however  i have to completely agree with doyleluver  when they said  and to quote glenn quinns character ben  im the star here in it  thats right im the talented one   if you watch the movie  just watch him  even when hes in the background    just his facial expressions  all in the eyes  you know for sure what motivates ben  exactly how he feels about comments  even if its a quick look behind a characters back  great acting in a fair film 
"This movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time. After having just viewed it, I can say it does not live up to those claims.<br /><br />The idea of the movie is indeed demented. But overall, the execution wasn't at all cringe worthy. Even the final scene (the eyeball thing) isn't really that nasty. I was expecting something insane, instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget Violent Sh!t.<br /><br />Any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed, since there is no story whatsoever (though surely most people know this). Gore fans will be disappointed since, contrary to belief, the blood and guts here are few and far between. Not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history.<br /><br />Regardless of what people say, this movie isn't that shocking, it just plain all out sucks. Avoid it.",0,this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time  after having just viewed it  i can say it does not live up to those claims  the idea of the movie is indeed demented  but overall  the execution wasnt at all cringe worthy  even the final scene  the eyeball thing  isnt really that nasty  i was expecting something insane  instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent sh t  any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed  since there is no story whatsoever  though surely most people know this   gore fans will be disappointed since  contrary to belief  the blood and guts here are few and far between  not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history  regardless of what people say  this movie isnt that shocking  it just plain all out sucks  avoid it 
"I recently watched Spirit and enjoyed it very much, I've seen it about 4 times now on HBO and will buy the DVD. Those who gave negative reviews would probably think that `Vanishing Point' was just another car chase movie and `Thelma & Louise' was just another chick flick. Although the conclusions of those films are darker I feel the themes are somewhat related; that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you. The other common trait of these movies is the caring, thoughtful `guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity.<br /><br />Another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else's home. All one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that.<br /><br />I thought the animation and the story were amazing, the animators really got the horses to look, act and move naturally. Spirit's emotions were very clear as the story progressed (yes I'm aware they do humanize the horses a bit, but this is fiction). In a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire. In other more quiet scenes (which are most of the time) you're allowed to savor the backgrounds. One of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking, singing animals route. Doing so would take away from the story's power. Instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character, further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack. Another plus is that they weren't afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side (which really made this film watchable to me). This isn't prevalent through the entire movie though, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy.<br /><br />Those who appreciate horses will really like this movie, but I think it's a bit more than a horse movie. I don't feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they're brought up on the inane fare that's offered up today. But if they're the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like The Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty they'll likely love this movie.

"I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians totaling about 15 people. We all expected a good piece of Christian film-making. What we got was an excruciatingly painful, drawn-out, and pretty boring attempt at a film. It has good looking production values but also has poor acting, a weak script with lousy dialogue, and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than ""Anaconda."" None of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours. Flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad, bad movie. I'd give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is only that high because I rented the abominable ""movie"" Werewolf (1996) the night before I saw this movie.",0,i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about 15 people  we all expected a good piece of christian film making  what we got was an excruciatingly painful  drawn out  and pretty boring attempt at a film  it has good looking production values but also has poor acting  a weak script with lousy dialogue  and no real sense of direction  from the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night  we all hated it  and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than  anaconda   none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours  flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography cant save this bad  bad movie  id give it a 3 out of 10  and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable  movie  werewolf  1996  the night before i saw this movie 
"I first saw this movie as a pre-teen, about the age when kids start to think through their identity. I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own. The eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father (which Kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other). The man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts. The man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one, who still prefers her brother.<br /><br />Each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions.<br /><br />It's a great film, even if it is not the greatest Kurosawa film.",1,i first saw this movie as a pre teen  about the age when kids start to think through their identity  i was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own  the eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father  which kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other   the man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts  the man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one  who still prefers her brother  each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions  its a great film  even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film 
"This movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what NOT to do. The original kicked some major tire squealing butt, this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of Bruckheimer films, which is: we all know they suck, but they have great action. This film has NO ACTION. This film is BORING. Where are the cars? Where are the chases? Where's the tension? Where's the suspense? Where's the rush? Where!!?? This isn't really a movie at all, it's a bad commercial. 50 cars in 24 hours? That is wrong. They have 3 days to steal them, the ad is wrong. How bad is that? The leads acting is stiff, wooden and forced. The villain, the cop, the others...who cares. They utter their pointless lines, they serve the illogical plot. They slog through it the best they can as the music video director says ""don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is"" or ""we'll fix it with lots of loud music"" The ""script"" isn't really a script at all, it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of: -------Warning - possible spoiler------ 5------4-----3-----2-----1------ The Fugitive. The biggest crime of all is the underuse of Vinnie Jones, man....this is the baddest, coolest mofo since Jules in Pulp Fiction. And what do they do!? They make him a mute who's hardly in the film! Make Vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film. How could they have been so dumb? How? How? Why? The original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away. The original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers! Go find the original. Or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent RONIN. The chases in Ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged. Bruckheimer and Cage had all that money, all those resources, all that experience, and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for $250,000? How can that be? You feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie.

"<br /><br />Film dominated by raven-haired Barbara Steele, it was seen when I was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle, seeking blood. Steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead pre-date Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shamblers, unifying them in my mind.<br /><br />I don't see the connection between this film and THE HAUNTING, which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without pretention, daring you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There's no such draw to HAUNTING's overwrought Claire Bloom. The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial.<br /><br />And no, this movie does NOT need to be remade. Not only is it a product of the Sixties, but the large percentage of talentless cretins in Hollywood cannot fathom MACABRE's formula for terror. That formula is based on one overriding factor: GOOD WRITING. Low-grade classics like CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a commonality of strong writing. It's simple. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess.

"Three sergeants in the British army stationed in India, are sent out to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees lead by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the regiment's water boy, goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him, but are also captured. Now the major sends a full detail out after the three, but do not realize that they are walking into a trap set by the Thugees. It is though, Gunga Din who saves the day.

"The title alone (along with the poster) is enough to give away ""The Projected Man"" as an obvious rip-off of ""The Fly"". And Bryant Haliday, while much better than the typical IMDb review would have you think, is nobody's idea of an acceptable stand-in for Vincent Price. Although, come to think of it, who would be, unless Micheal Gough was available?? Still, if you are in the mood to watch a British ""Hammer"" style movie with a science fiction theme about a teleportation experiment gone horribly wrong...well, you still might want to give ""The Projected Man"" a pass and rummage around in the 'remaindered' bin at your local Wal-Mart for another teleporter-accident movie. Because this one just isn't all that good.<br /><br />Haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the MST3K crew for his part in this movie and in ""Devil Doll"", but he is actually the best thing in TPM. Maybe he can't carry the movie, but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay. The script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named Lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets...or something. So all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats. Then when poor Haliday gets mutilated by his machine, he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various Londoners who chance across his path. Tom Cruise and Eric Roberts using bullhorns couldn't have made this screenplay work. <br /><br />Meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project, but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole. The corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers, all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a Tattersall vest. Haliday's research assistant and ex-girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of British horror cinema. His secretary is forced to parade around in her ""smalls"". None of it really works or gels into a real movie.

"The Marriage of Maria Braun (MMB) is about a German girl (Maria) getting married to a German soldier (Herman Braun) just at the ending of the war. After being married for half a day and a night, Herman is send to the front again. To make ends meet, Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier. She got word that Herman died at the front, and things develop between her and the American soldier. Herman walks in on them, in bed, and after a confrontation between him and the American, Maria killed the American. Herman admits to the murder, ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him. The country is in shambles; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette. There are food shortages. It is in short, a time of survival of the fittest. <br /><br />Basically this film projects Maria's attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances, as a metaphor for Germany's loss of soul after they lost the war, and how it proceeds to rebuild itself. For example, Maria has the following conversation with a peddler (played by Fassbinder himself); the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that ""Kleist burns out to quickly, it does not provide enough heat for the cold"". The peddler answers ""That's another way to look at it. Right now, it's probably the correct way"". <br /><br />Maria meets a French/German business man, Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment. She decides to get involve with Karl, ""You're not having an affair with me; I'm having an affair with you"". She also takes responsibility in the company, and after a while has the complete trust of the firm. When Karl says ""I suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle"" she replies ""I prefer making miracles  then wait for them"". In her own words, she has become the ""Mata Hari of the economic miracle"".<br /><br />In a lot of Fassbinder's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms (see Freud); in other words, he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh*t, the false social mechanisms, the pretending. The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology. For example, she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point ""I need someone to sleep with"". As Fassbinder said ""the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society"". He also remarked that his films are anti emotional. <br /><br />I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant (apparently, frequently visited by Hitler himself). Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side, as if Maria's 'brutal honesty' wears him out, as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore. Karl says ""I have to tell myself over and over that I love life"". Maria replies ""That's life isn't it. As if we signed a contract to enjoy life. And then we go out to eat and talk about food"". I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships, to never submit completely to anyone. And why would you, if the central matter of most of his films is about ""What love becomes in this society  a commodity, an instrument of power, a weapon.""<br /><br />It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period. What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes, when you feel bad, that ""you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great"". But, Fassbinder was not interested in perfection. Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project. Since he completed films (approximately 4 a year) the way other people rolled cigarettes, it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes. Peter Marthesheimer, who wrote most of the script, mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park, overnight. <br /><br />Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria. Mostly, she just stares bluntly into the camera. In Maria's own words ""It is a bad time for emotions. But, I like it like that"". <br /><br />There are different opinions about the end. After Karl died of a hart attack, Herman finally shows up. (Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison, to ""become human again"".) After the testament is delivered (made out to her and Herman in half), Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette, and blow her and Herman up. For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident. At the same time, she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true. She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore. She felt as if she had outlived herself.",1,the marriage of maria braun  mmb  is about a german girl  maria  getting married to a german soldier  herman braun  just at the ending of the war  after being married for half a day and a night  herman is send to the front again  to make ends meet  maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier  she got word that herman died at the front  and things develop between her and the american soldier  herman walks in on them  in bed  and after a confrontation between him and the american  maria killed the american  herman admits to the murder  ends up in jail and maria vows to wait for him  the country is in shambles  one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette  there are food shortages  it is in short  a time of survival of the fittest   basically this film projects marias attitudes   those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances  as a metaphor for germanys loss of soul after they lost the war  and how it proceeds to rebuild itself  for example  maria has the following conversation with a peddler  played by fassbinder himself   the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of kleist and she remarks that  kleist burns out to quickly  it does not provide enough heat for the cold   the peddler answers  thats another way to look at it  right now  its probably the correct way    maria meets a french german business man  karl oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment  she decides to get involve with karl   youre not having an affair with me  im having an affair with you   she also takes responsibility in the company  and after a while has the complete trust of the firm  when karl says  i suppose well just have to wait for a miracle  she replies  i prefer making miracles  then wait for them   in her own words  she has become the  mata hari of the economic miracle   in a lot of fassbinders films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms  see freud   in other words  he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh t  the false social mechanisms  the pretending  the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology  for example  she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point  i need someone to sleep with   as fassbinder said  the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society   he also remarked that his films are anti emotional   i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the munich restaurant  apparently  frequently visited by hitler himself   maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side  as if marias brutal honesty wears him out  as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore  karl says  i have to tell myself over and over that i love life   maria replies  thats life isnt it  as if we signed a contract to enjoy life  and then we go out to eat and talk about food   i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships  to never submit completely to anyone  and why would you  if the central matter of most of his films is about  what love becomes in this society  a commodity  an instrument of power  a weapon   it was remarked that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war   with these clothing essentially the wrong period  what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes  when you feel bad  that  you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great   but  fassbinder was not interested in perfection  any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project  since he completed films  approximately 4 a year  the way other people rolled cigarettes  it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes  peter marthesheimer  who wrote most of the script  mentioned that fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park  overnight   hanna schygulla is brilliant as maria  mostly  she just stares bluntly into the camera  in marias own words  it is a bad time for emotions  but  i like it like that    there are different opinions about the end  after karl died of a hart attack  herman finally shows up   herman left for australia after he got out of prison  to  become human again    after the testament is delivered  made out to her and herman in half   maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette  and blow her and herman up  for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident  at the same time  she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true  she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore  she felt as if she had outlived herself

"Dolph Lundgren stars as a former cop/boxer who searches Boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother,who was well thought of in the community, however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact on the basis of his performance here, one would forget Lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. That said the material gives Lundgren nothing to work with, in fact, Lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent. However the movie is lackluster, the action is non-existent, the plot not given enough exploration (Too much boring B.S around Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is actually really good (As is newcomer Danielle Brett) but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next, which makes this movie particularly disappointing. If anything else though, it shows how underrated Lundgren is, as an actor.<br /><br />*1/2 Out Of 4-(Poor)",0,dolph lundgren stars as a former cop boxer who searches bostons kinky scene to find out who killed his brother who was well thought of in the community  however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame  dolph lundgren is very good in this movie  in fact on the basis of his performance here  one would forget lundgrens rise to fame involved action roles  that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with  in fact  lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible  co star danielle brett is also good  in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett  indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film wouldve been fairly decent  however the movie is lackluster  the action is non existent  the plot not given enough exploration  too much boring b s around lundgrens investigation of his brothers employer  and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous  once again  lundgren is actually really good  as is newcomer danielle brett  but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next  which makes this movie particularly disappointing  if anything else though  it shows how underrated lundgren is  as an actor   1 2 out of 4  poor

"2002's undeservedly popular ""I Love the 80's"" is an inane, idiotic, offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I'd guess that's what you'd call it) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called ""humor"" that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another!

"I feel Monarch Cove was one of the best written and acted out ""Drama"" Series to come on any Network in a long time. This show had great potential and I couldn't wait to view it each week. This could be developed into a great Primetime Soap. People look forward to this type of acting as we are being ""Reality TV"" overkilled. I long for the type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. provided.

There's so much to expand on with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right.

Later Kevin drowns in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fear.<br /><br />Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined to watch ""Haunted Boat"" on DVD.

The confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work, with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school.

"So, Fox pulled the plug midway through a drama/mystery...<br /><br />How lame is that? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens? Why weren't the remaining, already filmed episodes aired in the US? They were broadcast elsewhere.<br /><br />Hey, Fox! Are you listening? This was a great show, but you left us hanging. If you're going to introduce new drama/mysteries, at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme.

"Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. She's still exploring, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see.

"Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film.<br /><br />There is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we deal with a supposedly bungling Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin.<br /><br />The real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls,"" Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-Franco group.

"49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller/horror, 1988) Sick in bed with a fever 11-year old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. Her health progressively worsens as a series of mysterious 'black outs' grip her. In each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a desolate field, with only a sickly-invalid boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) inhabiting it. When a dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic ""paperhouse"", the life of Marc is put in jeopardy. Her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health.<br /><br />Critique: Haunting first debut feature from British director Bernard Rose. Taken from a fable (""Marianne Dreams"") by Catherine Storr, it leaves plenty of other 'original' fantasy works in its wake. Whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares it is hard to give it the mixture of fable and reality to make it work in film form. Director Rose successfully captures the children fantasy world aspect along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them.<br /><br />Feverishly scored by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with expertly timed 'jump out of your seat' moments. Most thrillers are very sloppy in this all-important aspect of scaring the audience into not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures suspense and never lets it go or falter sluggishly into the next sequence of events. Also, his mastery of placing objects within the frame (as in his P.O.V.shots) gives the cinematography an added dimension it would otherwise seem to lack. Only in Europe will you find such ominous looking places as the ones presented here: the lonely house, the fields, coastal towns, watchtower etc. <br /><br />Rose would follow this film with ""Candyman"" (1992), a true 'thinking person's' horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite.",1,49  paperhouse  thriller horror  1988  sick in bed with a fever 11 year old anna  charlotte burke  has only her drawings to keep her company  her health progressively worsens as a series of mysterious black outs grip her  in each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a desolate field  with only a sickly invalid boy named marc  elliot spiers  inhabiting it  when a dark  unknown danger threatens her idyllic  paperhouse   the life of marc is put in jeopardy  her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health  critique  haunting first debut feature from british director bernard rose  taken from a fable   marianne dreams   by catherine storr  it leaves plenty of other original fantasy works in its wake  whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares it is hard to give it the mixture of fable and reality to make it work in film form  director rose successfully captures the children fantasy world aspect along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them  feverishly scored by phillip glass  rose knows how to use music wisely with expertly timed jump out of your seat moments  most thrillers are very sloppy in this all important aspect of scaring the audience into not knowing what the next scene will bring  i also like the way he captures suspense and never lets it go or falter sluggishly into the next sequence of events  also  his mastery of placing objects within the frame  as in his p o v shots  gives the cinematography an added dimension it would otherwise seem to lack  only in europe will you find such ominous looking places as the ones presented here  the lonely house  the fields  coastal towns  watchtower etc   rose would follow this film with  candyman   1992   a true thinking persons horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite 
"After a few lean years, 1968 was a pretty swell time for Elvis: not only did he make that celebrated ""Comeback"" TV Special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. Therefore, personally I can forgive him for the misstep that was STAY AWAY, JOE which, at best, emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering. Sure, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are indeed embarrassing  as, respectively, a dopey Indian father to Elvis' character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on Mr. Presley too - but one is glad to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollywood talent like Katy Jurado (as Meredith's Mexican wife), the two Jones  Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic Chief Thundercloud who is Meredith's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day! <br /><br />While there is a surprising (if not unwelcome given their usual blandness) lack of songs, there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the male Indians hit the bottle steadily while Presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs! As can be expected, the typically 'Western' Arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy, snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point. On the other hand, the climactic 'destruction of the house' episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well here...",0,after a few lean years  1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis  not only did he make that celebrated  comeback  tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  speedway and live a little  love a little  therefore  personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away  joe which  at best  emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering  sure  burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing  as  respectively  a dopey indian father to elvis character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr  presley too   but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado  as merediths mexican wife   the two jones  henry and l q    and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is merediths stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day   while there is a surprising  if not unwelcome given their usual blandness  lack of songs  there seems to be no shortage of free for all parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs  as can be expected  the typically western arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy  snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point  on the other hand  the climactic destruction of the house episode is one weve seen too often since and doesnt work too well here   
"Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility, and growing old. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) which causes him to seek out his estranged father (Alan King), a movie-extra who fancies himself a big star. The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-liners galore, a flat, inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family-conflict at the ready. Crystal and King try their best, but King is over-eager and frequently over-the-top. JoBeth Williams has another one of her thankless roles, but manages to bring her innate, down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character. It's a comedy, I guess, but one that blinks back the tears...shamefully. ** from ****",0,billy crystal co wrote  co produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy drama about fathers and sons  adult irresponsibility  and growing old  billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack  ha ha  which causes him to seek out his estranged father  alan king   a movie extra who fancies himself a big star  the script is sub neil simon nonsense with one liners galore  a flat  inexpressive direction by henry winkler  stuck in sitcom mode   and family conflict at the ready  crystal and king try their best  but king is over eager and frequently over the top  jobeth williams has another one of her thankless roles  but manages to bring her innate  down home class to the proverbial girlfriend character  its a comedy  i guess  but one that blinks back the tears   shamefully     from

I even like Chuck, I don't find her annoying at all, and I generally hate overly sweet, nice, perfect characters. I even like the narrator's voice, even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some resemblance to some Walgreens commercials.

"This was an awful movie! Not for the subject matter, but for the delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, with no uplift at the end. The previews and ads made NO mention of this! Plus, for all that they played up whoopi goldberg, my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that, but it's just more of the problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would've never have seen it. Or at least, I would've been prepared for it.

"This ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies I've seen so far on Starz on Demand. They seem to pick up every straight to DVD crap-fest they can find and put it on here.<br /><br />Why? Who knows! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on TV. To be honest, this looked terrible from the moment I saw the trailer--but I did give it a real chance.<br /><br />I always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great.<br /><br />This is not one of those movies.<br /><br />You know the plot by now, I'm sure, if you're reading this. Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. It's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad ""heavy metal"" music video. Whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting, but it really, really doesn't. Anyway, she kills herself. Then she possesses someone. Then some killing starts. It's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible. When the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping. Was that the best sound effect they could come up with? I could find a better sound effect to use for free, (with no copyright,) on the internet... right. now.<br /><br />Don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you.

"House of Games is spell binding. It's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens. There are few movies I've seen that can grip you so quickly. From the opening scene this movie just gets you.<br /><br />I'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO DON'T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.<br /><br />I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists I have ever seen-bar none. From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.<br /><br />Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.<br /><br />There were a few movies I've seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it's way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. You know something's going to happen but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the ""something"" is, you realize you haven't even scratched the surface....<br /><br />House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well. As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion.<br /><br />In closing, I'd rank this 10 of 10, call it (although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list), most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best ""twists"" I've ever seen as well.

"GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium/Netherlands 2005).<br /><br />The mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him. She painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all. We barely know anything about her background or her motivations. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?<br /><br />I almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess. These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. I'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place. How on earth did Nanouk Leopold get funding (in large part from publicly financed funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak off. It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal. None whatsoever, just a vaguely defined concept, ""I want to do something from a woman's point of view"". The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.<br /><br />To make things worse, there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film. I cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this dire lack of material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried directing Maria Kraakman: ""Maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness"". A perfect cure for insomnia.

"What Is It? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas, and overtly racist music, among others) unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me as self-consciously ""freak show,"" and I don't mean only the unusual casting decisions. It has the feel of a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead (my second-least-favorite film of all time), which was by intent much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time.

So I finished it alone. It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen. If you want to watch a fun kids movie watch Shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE.

"Basically the exact same movie as ""House of Wax"" - Vincent Price's first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because ""The Mad Magician"" offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-D effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! ""Never change a winning team"" is exactly what writer Crane Wilbur must have thought when he penned down Price's character Don Gallico, another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him. Don Gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as Gallico the Great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled ""The Girl and the Buzz Saw"". Gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer Ross Ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of Gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company. The sleazy and relentless Ormond, who by the way also ransacked Gallico's once beloved wife, takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of Gallico's rival The Great Rinaldi. Inevitably Gallico snaps and sadistically butchers Ormond, but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim's image and even starts leading a double life. ""The Mad Magician"" is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in Grand Guignol style, with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part). The 3-D delights near the beginning of the film, like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains, merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50's hype, but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them. ""The Mad Magician"" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of Alice Prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era. Needless to state that Vincent Price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in. Like no other actor could ever accomplish, Price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way. You pity Don Gallico, yet at the same time you fear him enormously. You support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death. Vincent Price simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.",1,basically the exact same movie as  house of wax    vincent prices first genuine horror hit released the previous year   but seriously who cares  because  the mad magician  offers just as many sheer thrills  delightful period set pieces  joyous 3 d effects  sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor   never change a winning team  is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down prices character don gallico  another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him  don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history  entitled  the girl and the buzz saw   gallicos promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose  stating that all of gallicos inventions are the rightful property of the company  the sleazy and relentless ormond  who by the way also ransacked gallicos once beloved wife  takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallicos rival the great rinaldi  inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond  but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victims image and even starts leading a double life   the mad magician  is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50s horror movie in grand guignol style  with a whole lot of improbably plot twists  the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist   and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross out moments  although they obviously remain suggestive for most part   the 3 d delights near the beginning of the film  like a yo yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains  merely just serve as time filler and contemporary 50s hype  but its still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them   the mad magician  is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view  as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era  needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film  as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in  like no other actor could ever accomplish  price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way  you pity don gallico  yet at the same time you fear him enormously  you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death  vincent price simply was a genius actor and  in my humble opinion  the embodiment of the horror genre

A case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to Judi.<br /><br />The band members are an interesting group and ride above the clichés too. One is in jail, one has found religion, one is an alkie, and one has sunk into dementia. But the joie de vivre rediscovered by Judi, ignited by her granddaughter's interest, carries us along and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot.<br /><br />The cast are a who's who of talent, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with her amazing high notes, a last performance from Joan Sims, brava Joan, a cute as a button flirtatious Ian Holm having a ball, and Olympia Dukakis as a money-grabbing divorcée living in the highlands of Scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey, The closing scene is standard Hollywoodland fare, the judgmental children of the star converted to fun-loving supporters, the old lovers reunited, the youngsters swept up in the old timers' music.

"I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan, and one day I was looking at the Cast&Crew selection on one of his DVD's and saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it. We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler that didn't hit puberty yet, he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out. I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn't work once. Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before.

"The opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the Archers' logo, the introductory disclaimer, the way the camera pans over the cosmos. It's strange to think that `It's a Wonderful Life' came out in the same year. No great coincidence: the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered, something best passed over in silence, when placed next to Alfred Junge's vision.<br /><br />It continues to look great all the way through, as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us. I'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general. One of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other. Not so here. Powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world, a mere change of palettes. Both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own.<br /><br />As for the story ... this may be Pressburger's best script, or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events. Other than that it's tight, yet with more going on than I can possibly allude to here. Was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary? (Or both? Perhaps Carter dreamt up a fantasy that was, as it so happened, true.) Everyone says we're meant to neither ask nor answer this question, but I don't see why. I'm sure we ARE meant to ask the question. The film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed, the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions. The fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn't mean that this shouldn't occupy us as well. There is, as I've said before, a lot going on.<br /><br />Consider the scene in which Abraham Farlan (Heaven's prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match, and contemptuously says, `The voice of England, 1945.' Dr. Reeves (the defence) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment, and then produces one of his own: a blues song from America, which Farlan listens to as though he's got a lemon in his mouth. Reeves looks smug.<br /><br />Snobbery? Well, I don't see why it's snobbish to condemn blues music - and that's not what Powell and Pressburger are doing, anyway. As the song is being played, we get a shot of the American soldiers listening to it: several of them nod their heads to the rhythm, perfectly at home. THEY don't find it incomprehensible. There's something valuable about the song and neither Reeves nor Farlan knows what it is. Reeves probably realises as much. All English audiences (and all Australian, Indian, etc. audiences as well) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast, too; and that while Reeves understands THAT, he is unable to explain it to Farlan - hence the blues broadcast, which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else. It's a clever scene.<br /><br />One last thing. I found David Niven a bit cold, without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so, I don't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began, as this one did.",1,the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness   the altered version of the archers logo  the introductory disclaimer  the way the camera pans over the cosmos  its strange to think that  its a wonderful life came out in the same year  no great coincidence  the 1940s was awash with heaven and earth films  but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered  something best passed over in silence  when placed next to alfred junges vision  it continues to look great all the way through  as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us  im not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general  one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other  not so here  powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if its the most natural thing in the world  a mere change of palettes  both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own  as for the story     this may be pressburgers best script  or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events  other than that its tight  yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here  was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary   or both  perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was  as it so happened  true   everyone says were meant to neither ask nor answer this question  but i dont see why  im sure we are meant to ask the question  the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is   indeed  the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions  the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesnt mean that this shouldnt occupy us as well  there is  as ive said before  a lot going on  consider the scene in which abraham farlan  heavens prosecuting lawyer  plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match  and contemptuously says   the voice of england  1945  dr  reeves  the defence  acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment  and then produces one of his own  a blues song from america  which farlan listens to as though hes got a lemon in his mouth  reeves looks smug  snobbery  well  i dont see why its snobbish to condemn blues music   and thats not what powell and pressburger are doing  anyway  as the song is being played  we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it  several of them nod their heads to the rhythm  perfectly at home  they dont find it incomprehensible  theres something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is  reeves probably realises as much  all english audiences  and all australian  indian  etc  audiences as well  know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast  too  and that while reeves understands that  he is unable to explain it to farlan   hence the blues broadcast  which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else  its a clever scene  one last thing  i found david niven a bit cold  without the charisma he would acquire later in his career  but even so  i dont think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began  as this one did 
"I should have figured that any movie with the Poltergeist lady in it isn't going to be good. It actually starts out okay, but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you're watching is a movie inside of a movie. There's people sitting in a movie theatre watching that movie. One girl in the audience is so annoying that I would have turned around and strangled her.

"Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a worthwhile movie. While the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer. In addition, I found spotting actors I knew a real pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? I'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, I recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of America, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.",1,taken in the context of the time it was made  i found this a worthwhile movie  while the details may be dramatized  the overall history was a nice primer  in addition  i found spotting actors i knew a real pleasure  who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad  ill leave the rest of the star spotting to you  as to the secondary casting  this movie  as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties  has many an enjoyable character actor  but top kudos to andrew jacksons right hand man peavey  the perfect touch of comedy  well shot  with beautiful ships  and competent acting throughout out  i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp  or an eye for a double period piece  set at the dawn of america  and made in a period when great names  and top notch character actors  were a real pleasure to enjoy

"Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors. I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen. But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. During the time he worked for Hollywood studios, he knew how to take an assignment, shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. On the surface it's one more of Hollywood's early Fifties' anti-Commie movies, complete with appeals to patriotism, a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut, exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. The hero, Skip McCoy, is a three-time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end. The girl in the caper, Candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined. One of the most appealing characters, Moe Williams, is a stoolie. And in an unusual approach to Hollywood's battle against Commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling. He just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy. <br /><br />Plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio. He had to make do. Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but Jean Peters is a surprise. She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. And Richard Kiley, who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly. It's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, I mean introduced to us, ""The Impossible Dream"" from Man of La Mancha, <br /><br />More than anything else, this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash, pursued by the Feds and the Commies, moves straight ahead with great economy. The whole enterprise, with a classic noir look, only takes 80 minutes to tell. The dialogue, with Fuller as screenwriter, has that party corny, partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. ""That muffin you grifted...she's okay,"" one character says to Skip about Candy. Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams. All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part sad inevitability. <br /><br />The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller's talents and strengths. In 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting right after the credits, Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie, to establish for us what the story is about, and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- we're going to be involved with. And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot, packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us. <br /><br />Says Glenn Erickson, in my opinion one of the best of movie critics, ""In what should be an inconsequential story, Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked, aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it. As always in his work, the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort."" He's right, and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years.",1,samuel fuller is hardly one of americas great directors  im not sure he qualifies as one of hollywoods great craftsmen  but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywoods true professionals who were willing to march to their own music  during the time he worked for hollywood studios  he knew how to take an assignment  shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts   on time and on budget  pickup on south street is a case in point  on the surface its one more of hollywoods early fifties anti commie movies  complete with appeals to patriotism  a hard boiled hero and a slimy  and copiously perspiring  bad guy  fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichés into a taut  exciting drama with any number of off kilter twists  the hero  skip mccoy  is a three time loser  a petty crook with soft fingers who doesnt change his stripes until the very end  the girl in the caper  candy  has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if youre so inclined  one of the most appealing characters  moe williams  is a stoolie  and in an unusual approach to hollywoods battle against commies  the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears  the hero isnt motivated by anything so ennobling  he just wants payback for a personal reason  and winds up becoming   at least for now   a good guy   plus  all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio  he had to make do  richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star  but jean peters is a surprise  she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb  and no better than her boy friends   or her clients   want her to be  and richard kiley  who later would become a two  time tony award winning star on broadway  is convincingly slippery and cowardly  its hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us  i mean introduced to us   the impossible dream  from man of la mancha   more than anything else  this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash  pursued by the feds and the commies  moves straight ahead with great economy  the whole enterprise  with a classic noir look  only takes 80 minutes to tell  the dialogue  with fuller as screenwriter  has that party corny  partly pungent hard boiled pulp fiction style   that muffin you grifted   shes okay   one character says to skip about candy  fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next  then fuller throws in the character of moe williams  all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest  part comedy relief and part sad inevitability   the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fullers talents and strengths  in 2 minutes and 15 seconds  starting right after the credits  fuller is able to instantly power up the movie  to establish for us what the story is about  and to show us what kind of characters    skip and candy    were going to be involved with  and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot  packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us   says glenn erickson  in my opinion one of the best of movie critics   in what should be an inconsequential story  sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up  stiff necked  aggressive self interest that when fully expressed recognizes whats wrong and whats right and isnt afraid to fight for it  as always in his work  the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort   hes right  and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years 
"I loved ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" so much that I rushed out to get ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" to see Cushing at it again...even if it was without Chistopher Lee this time. To my great disappointment, this movie not only does without Lee, but it does without Frankenstein's Monster altogether! Was it a case of ""If we can't get Lee, we won't have a monster at all""? Why would they do that? The monster is half the fun of the whole thing!! This film is dedicated solely to the study of Baron Frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum. I found the script extremely weak, with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much. I'm willing to suspend a fair amount, but this movie got fairly ridiculous, which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it.<br /><br />Peter Cushing, though, is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film. For being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men, he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well. The supporting cast is competent, but has little to do, even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping Frankenstein. A bumbling police chief is introduced, along with his put-upon sidekick, to generate some comic relief, then they are completely dropped from the movie! Why? We are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the Baron, then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor, and then it ends up being the victim of Frankenstein's brain transplant experiment. There was no tension, we weren't invested in the ""creature"", and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel.<br /><br />Also, there are virtually no ""horror"" elements. Yes, there is a beheading in the beginning (off-camera), and we are treated to the sounds of Cushing cutting the tops of two men's skulls off (again, off camera), and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene (90% of which is, again, off-camera). I understand that there is a love of ""letting the audience imagine it all, for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show"", but come on, if you're not going to give us a Monster, then at least let us SEE the few ""horrific"" elements you do choose to include. Showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary.<br /><br />On top of a weak script, I thought the directing was mostly flat. There were a couple of nice shots, but otherwise no excitement, atmosphere, or suspense was generated. The same director did ""Curse"" back in 1958 and I thought it was brilliantly directed...guess he was as uninspired by this film as I was.<br /><br />The movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for Peter Cushing's powerful, nuanced performance...beyond that, I found little in this movie worth recommending. Instead, my suggestion is to watch ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" and see a truly great Hammer horror film.",0,i loved  the curse of frankenstein  so much that i rushed out to get  frankenstein must be destroyed  to see cushing at it again   even if it was without chistopher lee this time  to my great disappointment  this movie not only does without lee  but it does without frankensteins monster altogether  was it a case of  if we cant get lee  we wont have a monster at all   why would they do that  the monster is half the fun of the whole thing   this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum  i found the script extremely weak  with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much  im willing to suspend a fair amount  but this movie got fairly ridiculous  which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it  peter cushing  though  is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film  for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men  he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well  the supporting cast is competent  but has little to do  even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping frankenstein  a bumbling police chief is introduced  along with his put upon sidekick  to generate some comic relief  then they are completely dropped from the movie  why  we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron  then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor  and then it ends up being the victim of frankensteins brain transplant experiment  there was no tension  we werent invested in the  creature   and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel  also  there are virtually no  horror  elements  yes  there is a beheading in the beginning  off camera   and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two mens skulls off  again  off camera   and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene  90  of which is  again  off camera   i understand that there is a love of  letting the audience imagine it all  for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show   but come on  if youre not going to give us a monster  then at least let us see the few  horrific  elements you do choose to include  showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary  on top of a weak script  i thought the directing was mostly flat  there were a couple of nice shots  but otherwise no excitement  atmosphere  or suspense was generated  the same director did  curse  back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directed   guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was  the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter cushings powerful  nuanced performance   beyond that  i found little in this movie worth recommending  instead  my suggestion is to watch  the curse of frankenstein  and see a truly great hammer horror film 
"One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams, rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins. One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside, causing the material to wash downhill, where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries. The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields, where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. Thus, the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner.<br /><br />First, we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor, a very rare treatment in 1938. A story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time. The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors, with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations. Then, we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero, to be paired with Olivia de Havilland. Among other things, this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it. Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes, in his small role, seemed unusually subdued. Unfortunately, I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film. The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems. It needed to be more like ""The Good Earth"", released just the year before. Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man, such as Errol Flynn. Finally, there is the matter of the inane title. Surely, Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title. ""Gold or Grain"" is short and to the point. Incidentally, I understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills', waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.",0,one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams  rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins  one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s  this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside  causing the material to wash downhill  where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment  the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries  the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas  some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields  where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult  thus  the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner  first  we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor  a very rare treatment in 1938  a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time  the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors  with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations  then  we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero  to be paired with olivia de havilland  among other things  this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it  even the usually colorful gabby hayes  in his small role  seemed unusually subdued  unfortunately  i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film  the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems  it needed to be more like  the good earth   released just the year before  just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man  such as errol flynn  finally  there is the matter of the inane title  surely  warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title   gold or grain  is short and to the point  incidentally  i understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills  waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining 
"Set during WWII, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for kids, starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with the help of three evacuee children and a 'Professor of Witchcraft', thwarts a Nazi invasion.<br /><br />Brilliantly inventive, with loads of laughs, this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters, exciting story and catchy tunes. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not-quite-perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are equally impressive as the Cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty Hun.<br /><br />The special effects are somewhat dated, but let's face it, kids don't care too much about these things, so long as they are entertained. And entertained, they will be. With some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect, and more genuine movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. In fact, only a rather drawn-out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film's perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, that can easily be forgiven.<br /><br />And besides, any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me.",1,set during wwii  bedknobs and broomsticks is a fun filled fantasy adventure for kids  starring angela lansbury as an apprentice witch who  with the help of three evacuee children and a professor of witchcraft  thwarts a nazi invasion  brilliantly inventive  with loads of laughs  this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters  exciting story and catchy tunes  lansbury is perfect as eglantine  the not quite perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime  and her three young co stars  cindy ocallaghan  roy snart and ian weighill  are equally impressive as the cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty hun  the special effects are somewhat dated  but lets face it  kids dont care too much about these things  so long as they are entertained  and entertained  they will be  with some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect  and more genuine movie magic than a hundred harry potters  it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism  in fact  only a rather drawn out musical number set in portobello road mars the films perfection  but with so much else to enjoy  that can easily be forgiven  and besides  any film featuring uk television legend bruce forsyth as a flash harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me 
"Despite its budget limitations, this is a great film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a nice red herring. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a well-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.",1,despite its budget limitations  this is a great film  proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash  the opening  in which cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings  is a nice red herring  after that  a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which  in turn  causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg  maybe the cave paintings suggest instead that this isnt the first time such a thing has happened   when the prehistoric beast appears  its a well animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area  alright  so its not jurassic park  but its still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies

"This movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that I have seen! Especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear. Also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness. The story itself has problems: the UN could never take power over the world since the United States alone would not allow it but nations such as China, Russia, Japan, etc. would not either. This would also play against someone trying to take over the world as Nicolae Carpathia does. This reminds me of James Bond movies, only that those have more action! Naturally the movie is made for Christians and only for Christians and they may enjoy it. Since I cannot count myself a Christian I find the whole idea ludicrous. This prophecy furthermore seems to be, if believed to be true, dangerously close to other prophecies by cults for the end of the world. Why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on Earth without",0,this movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that i have seen  especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear  also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness  the story itself has problems  the un could never take power over the world since the united states alone would not allow it but nations such as china  russia  japan  etc  would not either  this would also play against someone trying to take over the world as nicolae carpathia does  this reminds me of james bond movies  only that those have more action  naturally the movie is made for christians and only for christians and they may enjoy it  since i cannot count myself a christian i find the whole idea ludicrous  this prophecy furthermore seems to be  if believed to be true  dangerously close to other prophecies by cults for the end of the world  why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on earth without

My girlfriend picked this one; as a southern born and raised African American I found this movie's plot and premise totally without credibility. To believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who being southern knows better) to participate in this crap,0,my girlfriend picked this one  as a southern born and raised african american i found this movies plot and premise totally without credibility  to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante bellum south  totally absurd     i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell  who being southern knows better  to participate in this crap
"I saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and I hadn't seen an Almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.<br /><br />Or so I thought. Then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details, like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.<br /><br />Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film--you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us strange, off-beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies, and Almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point. What is the significance, for example, of the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? Why is that even in there? Just to surprise us?<br /><br />There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. And that's it, that's the only entertaining moment. The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trickery for a movie to be good.",0,i saw this movie the other day in a film school class  and i hadnt seen an almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good  unfortunately  it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom  high heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together dont add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all  or so i thought  then  the next day  my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movies hidden little details  like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule  apparently  the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this  great  but you know what  its still a bad movie  it takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film  you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention  something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks  high heels gives us strange  off beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies  and almodovar doesnt seem to be using them to make any kind of point  what is the significance  for example  of the hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film  why is that even in there  just to surprise us  there is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast  and thats it  thats the only entertaining moment  the rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart pedro almodovar is  but no matter what my film professor says  it takes more than self indulgent trickery for a movie to be good

"13 days to Glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the Mexican viewpoint. The major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor James Arness played the part of Jim Bowie persuasively, the rest of the name actors in the cast Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old.<br /><br />Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle. The scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand. Failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military. Santa Anna was within his prerogatives to be angry. Raul Julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene.<br /><br />Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage.

"I wasn't terribly impressed with Dante's 1st season offering in ""Homecoming"", it wasn't much of a horror story, but rather a smart political statement with the undead.

The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists. Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home. I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but is unclear because this is never revisited.

"Troubled men's magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models. When the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real, Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Writer/director William Byron Hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace, builds a reasonable amount of tension, delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence (one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm-inducing highlight), puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true-to-life characters, further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world, and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity. The fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot: Joanna Pettet as sunny, charming love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien's macho double amputee brother B.J., Seymour Cassel as Adrien's concerned psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien's feisty gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as gutsy homicide detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a hard-nosed police chief, and Misty Rowe as sweet, bubbly model Bambi. R. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. Jack Goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick. Popping up in cool bit parts are Robert Tessier as a gruff bartender, Sally Kirkland as a saucy hooker, Kathy Shower as a fierce female wrestler B.J. grapples with in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of her standard old woman roles.

"We do not come across movies on brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema, or any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels. Typically, a sister is depicted as a pile-on who can be used for ransom in the climax. This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light.<br /><br />It is inspired by George Eliot's novel ""The Mill on the Floss"". The brother is very prosaic, all-good, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society. In spite of this, the love of the brother-sister is the winner.<br /><br />This movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world.<br /><br />Although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries, yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true.",1,we do not come across movies on brother sister relationship in indian cinema  or any other language or medium  this relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels  typically  a sister is depicted as a pile on who can be used for ransom in the climax  this movie treats the subject in an entirely different light  it is inspired by george eliots novel  the mill on the floss   the brother is very prosaic  all good  the blue eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother  the sister is romantic  wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society  in spite of this  the love of the brother sister is the winner  this movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later  it is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world  although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries  yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true

"I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I watched it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though. It's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.<br /><br />If you took the actual film, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more entertaining. Seriously.<br /><br />If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S-Mart, back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.",0,i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt  even he couldnt make this movie enjoyable  the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad     but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though  its like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy     excruciatingly painful  if you took the actual film  dipped it in paint thinner  then watched it  it would be more entertaining  seriously  if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s mart  back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake 
"The snobs and pseudo experts consider it ""a far cry from De Sica's best"" The ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italianness doesn't have the convoluted self examination of modern Italian filmmakers, or the bitter self parody of Pietro Germi, the pungent bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children's bed before they went to sleep. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and in a lesser degree Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what today we call magic realism. The film is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that, naturally, requires for you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form.

"I was young film student in 1979 when the Union of the Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and premiered Konchalovsky's ""Siberiade""; Tarkosvky's ""Stalker"" and Danelia'a ""Autumn marathon"".

"I rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is THE worst movie I have ever seen. This isn't one of those ""it was so bad, it was funny"". This isn't one of those ""it was so gory, it leaves you with a bad feeling"" movies. It wasn't even one of those ""what the heck was that?"" movies. I can't recall the performance of the actors, but it was poorly shot, the story was disjointed, and it had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry that I had wasted the time.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of movies I didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and/or story-telling, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties.

"This is the final episode we deserved. At the end of the last season, things were left in a 'life goes on' mood, which was hardly the wrap-up that this realistic series deserved. While not a happy show, this series was always one that made you think (a rare thing on television), and this is no exception. 'Is death justified by reasoning?' 'Are morals reflective of society, or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power?' 'What is a just death, and can it exist?' All of these questions, and more, are posed by the writers of this show every week, and this is their final thesis. Fine acting, great writing, wonderful camera-work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran, then get a hold on a copy somehow. If you never watched the series when it ran, then this will stand up on its own, but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts. For those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons, this is very satisfying viewing.",1,this is the final episode we deserved  at the end of the last season  things were left in a life goes on mood  which was hardly the wrap up that this realistic series deserved  while not a happy show  this series was always one that made you think  a rare thing on television   and this is no exception  is death justified by reasoning  are morals reflective of society  or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power  what is a just death  and can it exist  all of these questions  and more  are posed by the writers of this show every week  and this is their final thesis  fine acting  great writing  wonderful camera work  brilliant editing  clean direction  if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran  then get a hold on a copy somehow  if you never watched the series when it ran  then this will stand up on its own  but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts  for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons  this is very satisfying viewing 
This is the first non-zombie subgenre review ive done but this movie is worth doing a review for. Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-movie. The Dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs* curse of the komodo*coughs. I enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth a watch.,0,this is the first non zombie subgenre review ive done but this movie is worth doing a review for  dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b movie  the dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process  jane longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs  curse of the komodo coughs  i enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general  overall 3 6 stars and worth a watch 
"I personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating's some people have given it. It is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated, now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me. Though, if you are a fan of Interesting, strong characters and heroic(sexy) women kicking butt and saving the world(hell) you will love this movie. I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie. Quite anime-esque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. meet's the live action version of Punisher. In the end I highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie.",1,i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the ratings some people have given it  it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated  now if you dont like comic books or animation then of course you wont like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me  though  if you are a fan of interesting  strong characters and heroic sexy  women kicking butt and saving the world hell  you will love this movie  i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie  quite anime esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation  like titan a e  meets the live action version of punisher  in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie 
"I was interested in the topic, and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dancing on David Letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it. OK, she shows some breast (or maybe a body double does). The plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible. Neither lead has any material to work with, as the direction of the film leads nowhere. Don't waste your time. See Donnie Darko instead if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore film, and if you want to see another, skip this and see Darko again.<br /><br />The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well. Refer to Charles Williams' novel ""Descent Into Hell"" for something worth considering instead.

"Extremely dull drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the Flicka of the title, and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place. Coated in blaring, overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue, this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache. The naffly-titled sequel, 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka', in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag, is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission, although there are at least one or two scenes that don't induce a coma.",0,extremely dull drama starring a very young roddy mcdowall  who trains a wild horse  the flicka of the title  and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place  coated in blaring  overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue  this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache  the naffly titled sequel  thunderhead  son of flicka  in which mcdowall trains the next generation of nag  is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission  although there are at least one or two scenes that dont induce a coma 
"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver.

"I love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I have seen most of this movie, since it's been airing on HBO for the past couple of months. I must admit, I MAY have missed a few scenes, but I'm usually drawn into movies, and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see some of ""Hollow Man,"" I feel depressed, almost like a ""film noir."" I'm not sure why; perhaps it's that I don't want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and there's disappointment in that. But I think it's witnessing just HOW relentlessly evil he becomes. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps 12, if they are mature).",0,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real  the special effects of this movie are very good  i have seen most of this movie  since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months  i must admit  i may have missed a few scenes  but im usually drawn into movies  and have seen some scenes more than once  but every time i see some of  hollow man   i feel depressed  almost like a  film noir   im not sure why  perhaps its that i dont want kevin bacon to be evil  and theres disappointment in that  but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes  regardless  i can recommend this movie for excitement  although some parts move slowly   but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14  perhaps 12  if they are mature  
"I never attended the midnight showing of a movie before ""Dick Tracy"" came out.<br /><br />I still have the ""t-shirt ticket"" I had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and, like that shirt, ""Dick Tracy"" has stuck with me ever since.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, the sharp visuals, bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain. It's a wonder to behold.<br /><br />As director/star/co-writer/producer, Beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here, taking a familiar American icon and re-creating him for a whole new era. Still set in the '30s, ""Tracy"" has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do. I've lost track of how many times I've watched ""Tracy"" and I still catch something new every time I do.<br /><br />The others are all top notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment, she can act (GASP!). <br /><br />But there's still such themes touched on as the necessity of family, keeping true to one's self, good versus evil, even Machiavellian themes are explored. Odd for a comic strip film, but hey, it works.<br /><br />All in all, ""Dick Tracy"" is a classic unto itself. Compared with other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It's a good, strong film that doesn't depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity to make its point. <br /><br />There's a lesson to be learned here.<br /><br />Ten stars.

"This film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks. Then Meena Kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in. Songs on All India Radio, especially Inhi LogoN ne were played so often that I was sick of them at the time, despite recognising their beauty! <br /><br />Yes, it did take all those years to make. This was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and Kamal Amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film; looking at the sumptous sets and costumes, not surprising!! Not only does Meena Kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to Lata's voice. Inhi logoN ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re-recorded like Chalo dildar chalo show clear development. I only wish someone would find the Ghulam Mohammad songs that weren't included in the film, because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them. Lata in a recent interview (2007) rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with, apart from Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the Chalo dildar songs, very unusual. There is only a brief shot of Raj Kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed Meena Kumari. Kamal Amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon. Any other film, this song would have had close-ups of both of them.<br /><br />As for this being the finest film ever, I would beg to differ. It means you have missed a lot of Indian cinema, in no particular order, films like Barsaat (old), Devdas (older versions), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Pyasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam, Kabuliwallah, Abhimaan, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay ka Babu, Daag, Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan, etc. etc. And if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from Barsat Ki Raat to Naya Daur, Teesri Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugnu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: the list is really endless!<br /><br />So enjoy Pakeezah but don't miss out on any of the above...",1,this film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks  then meena kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in  songs on all india radio  especially inhi logon ne were played so often that i was sick of them at the time  despite recognising their beauty   yes  it did take all those years to make  this was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and kamal amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film  looking at the sumptous sets and costumes  not surprising   not only does meena kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to latas voice  inhi logon ne has her 50s younger voice while songs that were re recorded like chalo dildar chalo show clear development  i only wish someone would find the ghulam mohammad songs that werent included in the film  because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them  lata in a recent interview  2007  rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with  apart from madan mohan  a great personal friend   notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the chalo dildar songs  very unusual  there is only a brief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed meena kumari  kamal amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon  any other film  this song would have had close ups of both of them  as for this being the finest film ever  i would beg to differ  it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema  in no particular order  films like barsaat  old   devdas  older versions   bandini  do bigha zameen  garam hava  dastak  guddi  aan  pyasa  kagaz ke phool  sahib bibi aur ghulam  kabuliwallah  abhimaan  guide  sujatha  bombay ka babu  daag  parineeta  old   umrao jaan  etc  etc  and if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from barsat ki raat to naya daur  teesri manzil  mahal  aag  jugnu  anand  mera naam joker  the list is really endless  so enjoy pakeezah but dont miss out on any of the above   
"This film is like a 1950-version of Ettore Scola's Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Less sex and less realism, but a tale with great humanism and warmth. I wouldn't call this a neo-realistic picture. It's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be classed as a comedy, although it deals with serious matters (a little like Chaplin or 1930-comedy). Typical Italian though, very emotional, and hard to resist except for a stone cold person. The sentimentalism is a letdown, although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it is a lovable and hilarious comedy, with good music.<br /><br />7/10",1,this film is like a 1950 version of ettore scolas brutti sporchi e cattivi  less sex and less realism  but a tale with great humanism and warmth  i wouldnt call this a neo realistic picture  its very sentimental and more like a fairy tale  and should probably be classed as a comedy  although it deals with serious matters  a little like chaplin or 1930 comedy   typical italian though  very emotional  and hard to resist except for a stone cold person  the sentimentalism is a letdown  although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama  its not a masterpiece like umberto d or the bicycle thief  but it is a lovable and hilarious comedy  with good music  7 10

It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was horrified. William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together.

"There is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of The Indian Runner. Unzip your trousers. Peek inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? Okay, you'll do.<br /><br />This film has all the male requisites: blood, guns, car chases, fond women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, pyrotechnics -- what have I left out? -- oh, yeah, blowtorches.<br /><br />As a woman, I seriously hope Sean Penn regards this as a `when I was a child...' kind of effort. Since he both wrote and directed the thing, he's nearly solely responsible. An uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job's supposed to be done) tries to save Penn. Too late. The lines and action are there. Even devoted, skilled acting can't change those.<br /><br />I found this movie puerile and silly, as well as predictable. The dialogue staggers along -- Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity. Then she dies. After a bit, so does the protagonists' father, played by Charles Bronson.

"There have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in ""The Bishop's Wife"" (1947). Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late '30s-early '40s. And, more recently, Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"" (1978), which was a remake of 1941's ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan."" These were well-written, funny, entertaining comedies, all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels.<br /><br />Now comes writer-director Jeff Lowell, making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable, bitchy young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist, Ashley (Lake Bell) who is falling for Kate's fiancé, Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing that is clear at the outset: Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two ""Topper"" films), who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured.<br /><br />There is a line right at the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry, ""You don't smile."" That aptly described my situation throughout this film.<br /><br />The main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny. But it's made worse by Longoria Parker's presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. Just to start out with, compounding her lack of comedic talent, she is covered with so much pancake makeup, who knows what she really looks like? Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue. She's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her (well, she actually just fades out), so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is.<br /><br />Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), so she introduces him to Ashley, who really doesn't know what she's doing as a spiritualist (she is also a cateress to make ends meet), to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate. There's a lot of meshugaas that goes on.<br /><br />The vacuity of the film is epitomized by a ""B"" story revolving around Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs). This is thrown in near the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she's as much of a boob as Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women, he deserves whatever he gets.<br /><br />Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin. It doesn't, and more's the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny. As it is, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray, and Co. must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two ""Topper"" films has wrought.",0,there have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of hollywood  cary grant was an angel in  the bishops wife   1947   of course the best were the topper movies in the late 30s early 40s  and  more recently  warren beattys  heaven can wait   1978   which was a remake of 1941s  here comes mr  jordan   these were well written  funny  entertaining comedies  all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels  now comes writer director jeff lowell  making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable  bitchy young woman  kate  eva longoria parker   who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist  ashley  lake bell  who is falling for kates fiancé  henry  paul rudd   one thing that is clear at the outset  longoria parker is no constance bennett  marion kerby in the first two  topper  films   who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured  there is a line right at the beginning when henrys sister  chloe  lindsay sloane  tells henry   you dont smile   that aptly described my situation throughout this film  the main problem with the film is that the script just isnt very funny  but its made worse by longoria parkers presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen  just to start out with  compounding her lack of comedic talent  she is covered with so much pancake makeup  who knows what she really looks like  kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue  shes so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her  well  she actually just fades out   so kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is  chloe wants henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after kates death  from what i saw of kate  he should have felt a wonderful relief   so she introduces him to ashley  who really doesnt know what shes doing as a spiritualist  she is also a cateress to make ends meet   to see if she can get henry back in touch with kate  theres a lot of meshugaas that goes on  the vacuity of the film is epitomized by a  b  story revolving around ashleys assistant  dan  jason biggs   this is thrown in near the end  but the way ashley handles it indicates that shes as much of a boob as kate  since dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women  he deserves whatever he gets  eventually kate appears to ashley and the fun should begin  it doesnt  and mores the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny  as it is  norman z  mcleod  constance bennett  roland young  alan mowbray  and co  must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two  topper  films has wrought 
"I commend pictures that try something different. Many films just seem like re-treads of old ideas, so that is the big reason I so strongly recommend Passport to Pimlico.<br /><br />The movie is set just after WW2 and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to be driving Londoners ""barmy"". The film centers on a tiny neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They, too, are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it. That is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! With this document, they reason, they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want, since it turns out they really AREN'T British subjects!

"Having developed a critical eye for film, and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my breath symbolically held. While I am an unabashed fan of Denzel Washington - both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona; I am an honest enough fan to admit the (very few) times when he hasn't quite hit the mark in a film or two. And I could be wrong about those - after all, I am not an actor. But this was different - Denzel would pour his career's experience into, and guide, a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man - the abuse of a child. As his directorial debut, no less. And develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man. I didn't want to be disappointed.<br /><br />And I wasn't.<br /><br />What I did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief, but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed despite it all. This film did it - and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it. It takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented. It takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it. And if he can further draw an audience in, and cause an audience to emotionally respond, without pity, the filmmaker has done his job. In any film. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. That is what makes good cinema.

"Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist, Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers. But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework. As might be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer, there's a definite element of 'Cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of the Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie. Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con.<br /><br />The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it's got a lot going for it all the same. Not worth starting a new religion over, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?",1,neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist  revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers  but then  nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew  especially one using the gangster con artist movie framework  as might be expected from luc bessons name on the credits as producer  theres a definite element of cinema de look about it  set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap  it looks great  has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style  all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment  but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck  and hes spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life  the universe and everything  if anything its problem is that hes trying to throw in too many influences  a bit of machiavelli  a dash of godard  a lot of the principles of chess   motifs and techniques  littering the screen with quotes  the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims  and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didnt want to turn into a movie  rather than a commercial for kabbalism  its really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce  chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the films central  somewhat metaphysical  con  the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy  literally  within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast peoples exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger  but its got a lot going for it all the same  not worth starting a new religion over  but im surprised it didnt get a us distributor  maybe they found ray liottas intentionally fake tan just too damn scary

"I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I didn't care for his delivery. He just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited, contrived juvenile smear campaign. Edit cuts galore, etc... The camera would be focused on him, and you'd see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog. Add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot, which is a film no-no.<br /><br />This documentary hits a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the movie is just so easily done. Picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid. It is so easy it is just wrong. I mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags? To make them contradict themselves, you just let them recite more then a verse or two. I do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves.<br /><br />I just think he could have done something a little more creative. The part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out. It could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs, or sex, or ???? He could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the Passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gone into the history of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had quite the colorful past. Delve into science v.s. religion. One is a very methodical, very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories. It builds on itself from a solid bottom up, a new layer on top of a more proved layer. An enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way. The other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims. It is so, because well I said so.<br /><br />Done right I'd say turn it into an HBO original series hit a different religion every week.<br /><br />It was an eye opener about one thing.

"Somebody called Howard Koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for ""Casablanca"", didn't he? Or didn't he. Maybe there's more than one Koch slinking around in Hollywood, and I'm not too fond of ""Casablanca"" anyway. Wait a minute -- yes, there is another Howard Koch slinking around Hollwyood. That's the one who wrote ""Casablanca."" No matter. I'll put as much care into this comment as ""Howard W. Koch"" put into this production, which is to say only a little.<br /><br />You know what this sounds like? Somebody read Cliff's Notes on Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" and decided, since no original thoughts were aboard the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and Hollywoodize it with a happy ending.<br /><br />There are differences. Lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so, asks them how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on Lear. But in the play, Lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl. He winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Kids can do that to you. (Take my kid, for instance. After all the effort I squandered on raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? No.) In the end, everybody in the play dies.<br /><br />In the movie, evidently, the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself, somebody jumps in and saves her, so the ending is, more or less, happy.

"""Opening Night"" released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of theatre actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. She is self-absorbed, often obnoxious, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined, although we are let in on the secret early. Rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband, actor/director John Cassavettes, who has a role in the film as well. This film is not without flaws - it is overly long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel. The ""improvising"" in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on way too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, playing Myrtle's sleazy producer. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed, and I never could figure out why she was in the film, except to placate Myrtle. See this film for Rowlands alone - she is fascinating throughout - and it is tough to take your eyes off her, although you will want to at times.",1, opening night  released in 1977  tries to be an ambitious production  it succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of gena rowlands  her character of theatre actress myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life  she is self absorbed  often obnoxious  and makes life miserable for those around her   in other words  not unlike some actresses  myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse   we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined  although we are let in on the secret early  rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband  actor director john cassavettes  who has a role in the film as well  this film is not without flaws   it is overly long  and the last part of the film where myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel  the  improvising  in some of the dialogue   at least while on stage   goes on way too long  some of the supporting characters give good performances  especially from ben gazarra  playing myrtles sleazy producer  joan blondells character is never fully developed  and i never could figure out why she was in the film  except to placate myrtle  see this film for rowlands alone   she is fascinating throughout   and it is tough to take your eyes off her  although you will want to at times 
"I have to confess that I am severely disappointed.<br /><br />This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. The reason why I watched it was that I wasn't entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was too.<br /><br />Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film. The rest is as un-Austen-like as possible.<br /><br />Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this. It wasn't in her character and it just wasn't done by a lady of the those times. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst.<br /><br />Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are at entirely inappropriate moments, warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed.<br /><br />And although this version is not much shorter than the other one, it feels like everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters, show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ?

My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says: ""rosy cheeks"", when he is talking about his baby daughter. He is such a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They pair up so well, and have such a great chemistry! I really hope that they can work again together. They are such attractive people, and are very good actors.

"I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene. He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.<br /><br />Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie.

"I don't understand why making remakes has become the trend. Every remake I have ever seen is awful, and this is no exception. If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, that it is a ""sleazy"" piece of trash, he is quite right. Why they would take a wonderful television show, which I loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know. The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits. A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. Another thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either. Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role. The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it is no comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role. I think that the casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible movie. I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free.

"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There's no plot.

It's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad. I know.

"Ooof! This one was a stinker. It does not fall 'somewhere in between Star Wars and Thriller', thats for sure. In all actuality, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! video and Captain EO, only with not as big of a budget, and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying. Simon Le Bon preens front and center, while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from Roxy Music's last 3 albums. Brief clips from Barbarella add nothing. Avoid at all costs.

"Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women.

"This is a hard-boiled Warner Brothers film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. A consummate master at portraying Machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"", Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the well-worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel-town. She has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers. Once her father dies in a distillery explosion, she hops a freight train to New York and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank.<br /><br />This would come across as preposterous were it not for Stanwyck's blazing work here. With her dead-eyed stare and amoral seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality. One of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh-faced John Wayne as of all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama gets heavy-handed toward the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a hush-hush job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to Lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury. A tacked-on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before Stanwyck sears the screen. The film has curious touches like Lily's bonding friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality.",1,this is a hard boiled warner brothers film starring a very young barbara stanwyck  a consummate master at portraying machiavellian cool  a technique she perfected eleven years later in billy wilders  double indemnity   stanwyck plays lily powers  the well worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel town  she has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her fathers customers  once her father dies in a distillery explosion  she hops a freight train to new york and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank  this would come across as preposterous were it not for stanwycks blazing work here  with her dead eyed stare and amoral seduction methods  it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality  one of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh faced john wayne as of all things  an accountant named jimmy mccoy  the melodrama gets heavy handed toward the last third of the film with a murder suicide  a hush hush job in paris to keep lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury  a tacked on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before stanwyck sears the screen  the film has curious touches like lilys bonding friendship with an african american woman named chico and the german immigrant who teaches lily about nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality 
"Surreal film noir released soon after the ""real,"" genre-defining classics ""The Maltese Falcon,"" ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" Welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others. He was playing by different rules. In fact, he was playing. This starts where other femme fatale films leave off, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is embellished with a display of Wellesian scenes (typical rapid-fire style), dialog (lots of ""hard-boiled"" philosophy), and unusual acting (good Hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional). To Welles ""genre"" may have meant ""formula"" but he seemed to like using ""mysteries"" as backgrounds for his ""entertainments.""",1,surreal film noir released soon after the  real   genre defining classics  the maltese falcon    double indemnity  and  the postman always rings twice   welles films shouldnt be evaluated against others  he was playing by different rules  in fact  he was playing  this starts where other femme fatale films leave off  so the vaguely logical  but interesting  whodunit is embellished with a display of wellesian scenes  typical rapid fire style   dialog  lots of  hard boiled  philosophy   and unusual acting  good hayworth presumably intentionally one dimensional   to welles  genre  may have meant  formula  but he seemed to like using  mysteries  as backgrounds for his  entertainments  
"Scooby Doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple, successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world. So, what happens when you've been everywhere and done everything with the formula? You switch it up right? Wrong. You stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again, keeping the core of its success intact. That is to say, stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it. This to me is why ""What's New Scooby Doo"" worked, they want back to the classic Scooby Doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" but for the most part had not been tapped since the original ""Scooby Doo Where Are You"".<br /><br />The first sign (to me) of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters; there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think ""Scooby Doo"" you aren't thinking of Film-Flam, Scrappy Doo or Scooby Dum. Even worse, the exclusion of the other core members of ""Mystery Inc"" generally indicate a group of production people who don't understand from a kids point of view how the show works. The basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual, stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand.<br /><br />This next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want: I hope that I can explain why I think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole; Fred represents the Driver, I think in general it is the purpose of Fred to give the group direction, organization and sub-tasks. Fred isn't a happy-go-lucky teenager, he's your boss, your teacher, your dad, your authority figure. Fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks (problem always equals solution for Fred). In many ways Fred is the antithesis to Shaggy. Shaggy is your best friend, that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are, he enables you to be brave, to not be at the back of the pack. Shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear. Velma represents rational thought, she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show. Left on her own would Velma solve a mystery? The group often finds itself in situations where truths aren't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task, chance is represented by Daphne. At one point (I think it is the first Scooby Doo series) she was known as ""danger prone"". Writers have used Daphne to link unrelated events together through accident. She frequently is the one who finds the secret door, collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together. Finally Scooby himself represents us, the participant. He is always in the centre of events, capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of, yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate. Scooby Doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining.<br /><br />Maybe I'm over thinking things but, in my life I've seen a lot of Scooby Doo (being a 30 year old self-proclaimed nerd, it kind of rolls with the territory). To me there is a magic with the classic ""Scooby Doo"" formula that should never be messed with.<br /><br />As many have pointed out; Scooby Doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite, it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal. Messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else, something lesser.",0,scooby doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple  successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world  so  what happens when youve been everywhere and done everything with the formula  you switch it up right  wrong  you stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again  keeping the core of its success intact  that is to say  stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it  this to me is why  whats new scooby doo  worked  they want back to the classic scooby doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in  a pup named scooby doo  but for the most part had not been tapped since the original  scooby doo where are you   the first sign  to me  of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters  there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think  scooby doo  you arent thinking of film flam  scrappy doo or scooby dum  even worse  the exclusion of the other core members of  mystery inc  generally indicate a group of production people who dont understand from a kids point of view how the show works  the basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual  stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand  this next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want  i hope that i can explain why i think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole  fred represents the driver  i think in general it is the purpose of fred to give the group direction  organization and sub tasks  fred isnt a happy go lucky teenager  hes your boss  your teacher  your dad  your authority figure  fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks  problem always equals solution for fred   in many ways fred is the antithesis to shaggy  shaggy is your best friend  that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are  he enables you to be brave  to not be at the back of the pack  shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear  velma represents rational thought  she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show  left on her own would velma solve a mystery  the group often finds itself in situations where truths arent obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task  chance is represented by daphne  at one point  i think it is the first scooby doo series  she was known as  danger prone   writers have used daphne to link unrelated events together through accident  she frequently is the one who finds the secret door  collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together  finally scooby himself represents us  the participant  he is always in the centre of events  capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of  yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate  scooby doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining  maybe im over thinking things but  in my life ive seen a lot of scooby doo  being a 30 year old self proclaimed nerd  it kind of rolls with the territory   to me there is a magic with the classic  scooby doo  formula that should never be messed with  as many have pointed out  scooby doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite  it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal  messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else  something lesser

"This rip off of the 1984 hit ""Gremlins"" is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made. Even for a 'B' grade movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot, acting, and goodness.<br /><br />It begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance. Why? Because a few minutes into the film he walks into the 'forbidden' safe, and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub.<br /><br />This is just an appetizer for the scat-filled main course. The main character, KEVIN, struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy. Perhaps he succeeds within the film, but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor. Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard, and is guided through his security shift in the (wait for it) abandoned studio lot. Yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself. Back to the film. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. They must be returned before sunrise or else...or else what? Exactly.<br /><br />Other characters include Kevin's 'macho' army friend NICK, Nick's 'woman' DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a bitch-slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits. There is Kevin's manipulative and 'reserved' girlfriend AMY, whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed Cher look-alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top.. Don't ask me how that works. Quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE. How such groups of friends are made is up for question. Kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self-stimulating. His hobbies include calling up sex-chat lines from other people's houses and most likely sniffing underwear.<br /><br />The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblins: knee-high creatures (aka. hand puppets) which, for some reason, attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood. Each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars... or the film having a big budget.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: The twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering ""What?"". The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by...their own free will. Perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc, or perhaps the story-writers got writer's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending. Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals ""What he learned in the military"" and detonates explosives which destroys the safe, signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride; better fitted to a ride on an escalator.<br /><br />The sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears.

"This movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks I've seen. The length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline. Also, the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure, and the dad is shot by a police officer? I can see where some originality might have been what they were going for, but it could have been better. Also, the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over. After hearing all of Lucy's name and figuring out it was 'Lucifer', I wanted to gag. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a male's name. It should be given to a male character. All in all, the movie was a bore, and could have used a better plot.",0,this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks ive seen  the length wasnt nearly long enough to include a good storyline  also  the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous  the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure  and the dad is shot by a police officer  i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for  but it could have been better  also  the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over  after hearing all of lucys name and figuring out it was lucifer  i wanted to gag  yes  its interesting that lucifer was a woman  but look at the name  its a males name  it should be given to a male character  all in all  the movie was a bore  and could have used a better plot

"SPOILERS<br /><br />Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and almost every single short is a gem. While I must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, there is not way you can hate this cartoon. Sure, it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the fact of the matter is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but some are just better than others. Well, this would fit into ""others."" <br /><br />Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast, and becomes easily frightened. Jerry observes how scared he is, and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates scary dilemmas for Tom, and Tom becomes scared out of his wits, and his lives. Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it, thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry did all of this, and chases him. Tom then accidentally bites the house maid. However, at the end Jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup.<br /><br />Overall, this is far from the best Tom and Jerry short out there, but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time. It makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this. The slapstick and gags in this that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short, but it felt like something was missing in this. It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it is still nice.<br /><br />7/10",1,spoilers tom and jerry is a classic cartoon  with a flawless idea  and almost every single short is a gem  while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts  there is not way you can hate this cartoon  sure  it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes  and i can say that i agree  but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great  but some are just better than others  well  this would fit into  others    here is the plot of fraidy cat  tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast  and becomes easily frightened  jerry observes how scared he is  and tries to scare him even more than he already is  he creates scary dilemmas for tom  and tom becomes scared out of his wits  and his lives  jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it  thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost  tom finds out that jerry did all of this  and chases him  tom then accidentally bites the house maid  however  at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup  overall  this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there  but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time  it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this  the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short  but it felt like something was missing in this  it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts  anyway  this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons  but it is still nice  7 10
"Interesting, fast-paced and amusing.<br /><br />I'm not one of those people who watches loads and loads of television.

"David Lean's worst film. Even 'In Which We Serve' was'nt as bad as this. Usually a film with a really good reputation like this one, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. But after watching this I just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945! I disliked the acting, stiff upper lip British mannerisms, story, script (which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny) and soundtrack. The elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive, but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice. Just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation. Another very overrated 'british classic'.",0,david leans worst film  even in which we serve wasnt as bad as this  usually a film with a really good reputation like this one  has at least some redeeming qualities  which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic  but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945  i disliked the acting  stiff upper lip british mannerisms  story  script  which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny  and soundtrack  the elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive  but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice  just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation  another very overrated british classic 
"I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it in Japan after having been here three years, afraid that I would cringe when I viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience. The movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I'm from). Not all the stuff is factually spot on, but the tone is perfect.<br /><br />I'm still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this film for its even-handed treatment of the two sides in the story. Interestingly, although the Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialog is redubbed in the Japan version to cover up obvious second-language delivery problems.<br /><br />I noticed one reviewer uses this in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with Japan by watching this film than by reading any of the ""serious"" books on the matter (most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing Japanese companies).<br /><br />Don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who, among other things, found it implausible that the Japanese would want to build cars in the US. (Of course, the Japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction.) This is a very warm and funny movie that I would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés, like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been funnier.",1,i saw this movie when it was new  later i rented it in japan after having been here three years  afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience  the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and pennsylvania  where im from   not all the stuff is factually spot on  but the tone is perfect  im still in japan many years later  and i continue to enjoy this film for its even handed treatment of the two sides in the story  interestingly  although the japanese american actors spoke japanese in the original  the dialog is redubbed in the japan version to cover up obvious second language delivery problems  i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class  i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the  serious  books on the matter  most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing japanese companies   dont be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one star reviewers who  among other things  found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us   of course  the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction   this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés  like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music  michael keaton has never been funnier 
"After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I gotta be honest...I just didn't like it. I had read so many good reviews on this movie, but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from,<br /><br />I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, there was two cameras used in the entire film (which was OK) but they seemed like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying.<br /><br />It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape, but don't! <br /><br />Very frustrating...I only just scraped through this one!",0,after just watching five across the eyes  i gotta be honest   i just didnt like it  i had read so many good reviews on this movie  but i just didnt get where these reviews have came from  i have got a lot of time for newcomers into film making  and im sure the directors will do well for themselves  but the budget they had was the main problem  there was two cameras used in the entire film  which was ok  but they seemed like really cheap cameras  another problem was the sound  you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time  all talking on top of each other   its just impossible to hear what theyre saying  it had a good idea going for it  in a nutshell  they hit a parked car then drive off  a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit  driven by a mad woman  who wants to kill them  and has plenty of chances to do so    and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape  but dont   very frustrating   i only just scraped through this one 
"Good western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. Lots of tough guys throughout; Cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. Several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing. One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?",1,good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds  lots of tough guys throughout  coberns character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type  several holes appeared in the picture  but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing  one really dumb scene shows heston emptying  45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire  a  to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo  b  the grass was obviously dry  why not just drop a match on it and let er rip

"I am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film. Look at it a month later and you might see it differently, or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first. After sitting through The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael at its UK premiere, it came as no surprise to me that I found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself. Shane Danielsen (Artistic Director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival), aided by the film's director and producer, gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience. Edinburgh Festival audiences are not easily shocked. Only one person walked out in disgust. The criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches M.A. film directors. This was not an overly 'shocking' film. There was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence, but far less extreme than many movies (most actual weapon contact was obscured, as were aroused genitals). The audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring, where the acting standards were not high, where the plot was poor, predictable and drawn out, and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie. Metaphors to the war in Iraq are contrived, over-emphasised and sloppy (apart from a general allusion to violence, any deeper meaning is unclear); and the 'fig-leaf' reference Marquis de Sade, as one audience member put it, seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale.<br /><br />We have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him (he stands out at school for his musical ability) but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence. When pushed, Robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him.<br /><br />The film is not entirely without merit. The audience is left to decide how Robert got that way: was it the influence of his peers? Why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life? Cinematically, there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hangs back (whether through too much drugs, shyness, a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn?). Several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room, partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen. In the foreground of the bare bones flat, a DJ is more concerned that the girl's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman. Ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention. The stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way. Robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground.<br /><br />But the rest of the film, including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable (if not overly realistic) sexual violence, is not up to this standard. Some people have had a strong reaction to it (the filmmakers' stated intention: ""If they vomit, we have succeeded in producing a reaction"") but mostly - and as far as I can tell the Edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from Cannes - they feel, ""Why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film-making?"" Director Clay Hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision. His replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet, even his defence that there is little plot development because he didn't want to do a standard Hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms, but unfortunately they do not apply to his film, any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates, or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols. Wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt, I spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening, but I found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial. There are many truths. One aspect of art is to educate, another to entertain, another to inspire. I had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions Ken Loach (one of the many great names he takes in vain) without going so far as to admit any agenda himself. He then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth. I am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director, or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work<br /><br />Andy Warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art. Clay Hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries.

"This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead, but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark-guy. Kind of like in Beauty and the Beast. It could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks, but there are some pretty gross plants instead. They make this one girl really itchy, so she lets herself get eaten by the shark-guy instead of scratching through the whole movie. The scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to, he even arranges for them to have private time for s-e-x, but the woman in this is a really shallow snob and thinks the shark-guy is an ugly, icky monster and wants nothing to do with him. She gave up on love! Just because he was a shark!

"It's possible that A Man Called Sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor. Maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day, but I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />James Garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of Americans over to fill the cast out. Folks like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who both wrote and directed this film.<br /><br />Garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he's so darn good at playing them. But he has played serious and done it well in films like The Children's Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. But A Man Called Sledge can't be counted as one of his successes.<br /><br />He's got the title role as Luther Sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Young gets killed in a saloon and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style measures, he's followed from the saloon by John Marley.<br /><br />Marley's spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. Garner gets his gang together for a heist.<br /><br />Here's where the movie goes totally off the wall. Usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon which some other reviewer cited. But in this one Garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. <br /><br />That was just too much to swallow. If taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. But I will say for those who like the blood and guts of Italian westerns, during that prison break there's enough there for three movies.<br /><br />That's not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends. But by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency.<br /><br />The great movie singer of the Thirties Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for the life of me I can't find him in the film.

"As I said, the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert hadn't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll. What kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway? It sounded the same as her horrible Russian accent in another movie that I have seen her in. Every time she opened her mouth I cringed. It took 3 tries before I was able to watch the entire movie. Brad Johnson was good as the other lead. <br /><br />I really liked the beach location scenes. They added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of Melissa Gilberts depressing portrayal. I think they could have used San Francisco views more to their advantage though.

"This is a re-imagining of Tarzan in the era of the Soloflex and Apocalypse Now. There's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the Tarzan legend. There's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that Tarzan doesn't speak. There's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an African jungle in 1910, could be this offensively stupid and plastic. Bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video-centerfold, as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project. If it succeeds anywhere it's in the implication that National Geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a Tarzan movie might be constructed.<br /><br />It would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn't employ the sexual tease as ONE of many tools to draw in viewers. Some really great film moments incorporate it. But this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here; at the time of its release and now. You sit through awful, dumb scenes that offer no interest, and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies. Yes... Bo Derek and Miles O'Keeffe are beautiful (um, congratulations on having a working libido.) but if that's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up. There's only a hairs-breadth difference between the two formats and (I'm just guessing here) a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter. The question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone.<br /><br />As a showman, John Derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife Bo in the movie ""10""; and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads. The movie itself was beside the point. He was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid, shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality.<br /><br />As a director, John Derek appears to require only that Mrs. Derek look pleasant, empty and hump-able in every scene. It's hideously shot. The camera placement is annoying. In terms of editing, the entire 'wipe' catalog is exhausted. The credit sequence is garish. And it's a toss-up as to who commits the worse screen offense; Bo Derek who's such a bimbo that she can't even figure out how to play a bimbo, or Richard Harris who shouts every line (as he likes to do) until you want to shoot him. At least with Bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her.",0,this is a re imagining of tarzan in the era of the soloflex and apocalypse now  theres nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the tarzan legend  theres nothing inherently wrong with the premise that tarzan doesnt speak  theres plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african jungle in 1910  could be this offensively stupid and plastic  bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video centerfold  as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project  if it succeeds anywhere its in the implication that national geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a tarzan movie might be constructed  it would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldnt employ the sexual tease as one of many tools to draw in viewers  some really great film moments incorporate it  but this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum   the tease is the only thing going on here  at the time of its release and now  you sit through awful  dumb scenes that offer no interest  and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies  yes    bo derek and miles okeeffe are beautiful  um  congratulations on having a working libido   but if thats your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up  theres only a hairs breadth difference between the two formats and  im just guessing here  a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter  the question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone  as a showman  john derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife bo in the movie  10   and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads  the movie itself was beside the point  he was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid  shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality  as a director  john derek appears to require only that mrs  derek look pleasant  empty and hump able in every scene  its hideously shot  the camera placement is annoying  in terms of editing  the entire wipe catalog is exhausted  the credit sequence is garish  and its a toss up as to who commits the worse screen offense  bo derek whos such a bimbo that she cant even figure out how to play a bimbo  or richard harris who shouts every line  as he likes to do  until you want to shoot him  at least with bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her 
"WARNING: This review contains SPOILERS. Do not read if you don't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film.<br /><br />With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.'<br /><br />The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer dog at his side, is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item. You know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at Halloween, the kind that you shake to make them glow? Schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people. It's the second-worst effect in the movie. Every time Schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick, the scene's atmosphere suddenly turns dark, like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement. It ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is.<br /><br />And what does all this lead up to? It's hard to tell when the final, confusing scene arrives. See, Burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that Shepherd found as some kind of `calling card,' but none of it makes sense. Why do Shepherd and Vincent age and Schiavelli does not? Schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants Shepherd dead, but even that doesn't make much sense when you really think about it. I mean, why doesn't he kill Jan-Michael Vincent? After all, he had twenty-five years to do it. And the aliens won't need him if Shepherd is dead anyhow, so why try to kill her? Speaking of the aliens, it is never clear what they really wanted out of Shepherd and Vincent. What is their goal? Why do they wait so long to intervene? How could they be so sure Shepherd would come back? Not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made `The Return' any more pleasant. You would still have bad lines, really bad acting, particularly by Shepherd, cheesy effects, and poor direction. Luckily, the stars escaped from this movie. Cybill Shepherd soon went on to star in `Moonlighting' with Bruce Willis. Jan-Michael Vincent went on to be featured in dozens of B-movies, often in over-the-top parts. Raymond Burr made a pile of Perry Mason television movies right up until his death. Vincent Schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films. Martin Landau, who played a kooky law enforcement officer, quickly made the terrific `Alone in the Dark' and the awful `The Being' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently. You can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to `The Return.'

"I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle in front of, and those I found made this one look unmissable. How misled I feel!<br /><br />Firstly, it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie. The performances are wooden, every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are, and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men (particularly soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. The whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension.<br /><br />If that sounds tolerable (or even enjoyable) to you, then be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, while quite good, is painfully distracting - as is her face, for some reason. The other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day. There are few surprises, but do watch for the 'Monty Pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks!<br /><br />I wasn't expecting action, but I had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad Christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all.<br /><br />Watch it under the folowing circumstances: 1: There's nothing else on. 2: You are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' TV movies. 3: The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling.",0,i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of  and those i found made this one look unmissable  how misled i feel  firstly  it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewifes daytime movie  the performances are wooden  every sentence is an attempt at poignant in the way that housewifes daytime movies and bad soap operas always are  and it is based in that predictable and well trodden premise that men  particularly soldiers  are essentially violent and incompassionate  the whole movie is about the drama apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension  if that sounds tolerable  or even enjoyable  to you  then be warned  linda hamiltons german accent  while quite good  is painfully distracting   as is her face  for some reason  the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators  with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day  there are few surprises  but do watch for the monty pythonesque endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers knapsacks  i wasnt expecting action  but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged  what i got was a particularly bad christmas feelgood story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all  watch it under the folowing circumstances  1  theres nothing else on  2  you are a fan of predictable housewife takes on men and wins tv movies  3  the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film  4  youve imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling 
This one is a little better than the first one. It still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old Bond movies were not realistic. That wears thin after so many parodies. The girls were more interesting in this one.<br /><br />There is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor. Hopefully one day real comedy will come back.,0,this one is a little better than the first one  it still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old bond movies were not realistic  that wears thin after so many parodies  the girls were more interesting in this one  there is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor  hopefully one day real comedy will come back 
"I watched this film, along with every other adaptation I could get my hands on- including seeing plays- in preparation for some academic research. The cinematography is very moving, as is the music. Unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story. I have never seen such an awful portrayal of Mr. Rochester. All of his most fundamental traits are gone. Where is his wit? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester more closely resembles Rochester's foil, St.John, than the character from the novel. In fact, the actor playing St.John in this adaptation played a passionate St.John while Scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but I honestly can't bear to see this film for too long because of George C. Scott's performance.",0,i watched this film  along with every other adaptation i could get my hands on  including seeing plays  in preparation for some academic research  the cinematography is very moving  as is the music  unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story  i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr  rochester  all of his most fundamental traits are gone  where is his wit  where is his passion  scotts rochester more closely resembles rochesters foil  st john  than the character from the novel  in fact  the actor playing st john in this adaptation played a passionate st john while scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling  which he does all the time   i have no idea what they were thinking  i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but i honestly cant bear to see this film for too long because of george c  scotts performance 
"This film has a lot of strong points. It has one of the best horror casts outside of the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye, plus leading man Melvyn Douglas. It's got all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone staircases, a mad scientist, townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires, an ""Igor""-type character, a beautiful girl, even a goofy-haired Burgomeister. The soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative. There's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script.<br /><br />But it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in ""Kleinschloss"" (""little castle""). The plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist (nicely played by Atwill) who values his work more highly than human lives.<br /><br />It's not top-tier material, because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for Dwight Frye. But it's worth a look if you like early b/w horror pictures.",1,this film has a lot of strong points  it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi karloff chaney circle  lionel atwill  fay wray  and dwight frye  plus leading man melvyn douglas  its got all the right ingredients  bats  a castle with lots of stone staircases  a mad scientist  townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires  an  igor  type character  a beautiful girl  even a goofy haired burgomeister  the soft focus camera work is moody and imaginative  theres even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script  but its not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in  kleinschloss    little castle    the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist  nicely played by atwill  who values his work more highly than human lives  its not top tier material  because of a ho hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye  but its worth a look if you like early b w horror pictures

"This movie is humorous, charming, and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so I simply accept it as is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, performs quite well as the blacksmith, Hank Martin, who by accident is transported back to another age, the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Alisande, or Sandy, the object of Hank's affections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon.<br /><br />I just love that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress up in tattered clothing and take to the high road with their knapsacks to experience the kingdom at firsthand. King Arthur's comment, ""I say, we are not alone"" while giving his scruffy garments a good scratch, is one of those hilarious moments in the film. William Bendix's portrayal is superbly ridiculous, not to mention his attempts at quaint ""ye Olde English."" <br /><br />The story is not deep but it's well done in my opinion and I enjoy it more each time I see it. It's great family entertainment too.<br /><br />",1,this movie is humorous  charming  and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment  hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so i simply accept it as is  bing  in his usual inimitable style  performs quite well as the blacksmith  hank martin  who by accident is transported back to another age  the time of king arthur  the beautiful rhonda fleming is breathtaking as alisande  or sandy  the object of hanks affections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable sir lancelot  played by henry wilcoxon  i just love that episode when king arthur  cedric hardwicke   sir sagramore  wm  bendix   and hank  bing crosby  dress up in tattered clothing and take to the high road with their knapsacks to experience the kingdom at firsthand  king arthurs comment   i say  we are not alone  while giving his scruffy garments a good scratch  is one of those hilarious moments in the film  william bendixs portrayal is superbly ridiculous  not to mention his attempts at quaint  ye olde english    the story is not deep but its well done in my opinion and i enjoy it more each time i see it  its great family entertainment too 
"This was a movie i could not wait to see! So i finally got it and I was pretty disappointed. For starters,the movie has so little said about New York,just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings,streets,bridges and cafes.It really doesn't stay focused on the New York magic.Another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie.I know that it is a remake,but it is not a french style remake! Anyway,here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies,such as long and messy scenes,no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! The story follows many lives ( too many for my taste) and they somehow seem connected in the end. I feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories. The movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending.So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.And there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love New York and i loved the cast !",0,this was a movie i could not wait to see  so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed  for starters the movie has so little said about new york just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings streets bridges and cafes it really doesnt stay focused on the new york magic another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie i know that it is a remake but it is not a french style remake  anyway here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies such as long and messy scenes no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style   the story follows many lives   too many for my taste  and they somehow seem connected in the end  i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories  the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyones happy ending so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each and there you have your 120 minutes   if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you   i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast  
"I didn't feel as if I'd been raped like I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS,but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS,BMW hates its audience,although not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly,uncanonical,idiotic,and the writing is horrifically bad.None of the stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all,they're a bunch of pod people. I wanted to dissect it,but after a few minutes,I gave up,because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories. ""The Perfect Word"" is an overbearing,ponderous study of forgiveness. ""Fifi's Folly"" only works if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she's a closet James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is an idiot concerning women. ""Broken Wing"" (or ""Broken Wind"" as I like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the bunch. Beast hates birds? Since WHEN? Don't watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated.

"With a movie called ""Gayniggers from Outer Space"" how could you go wrong? Just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use the Village People as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay-gags. Plot is unimportant. Too bad, this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot. The characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails.<br /><br />The title made me laugh and I was prepared to laugh even more about the film.

"To some, this Biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation... Others see it as a story of grace, restoration, and hope... It is actually both  Henry King illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin, and his upward climb of healing..<br /><br />'David and Bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity... Henry King handles the powerful story, taken from the Old Testament, with skill...<br /><br />David, 'the lion of Judah,' having stormed the walls of Rabgah, saves the life of one of his faithful warriors Uriah (Kieron Moore), and returns to Jerusalem... <br /><br />Back at his court, his first wife complains of neglect, and offends him for being a shepherd's son, distinguishing herself for being the daughter of King Saul...<br /><br />One evening, and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood, David's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath... She was beautiful and attractive... David could not take his eyes off her... He finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers... <br /><br />Sending for her, he discovers that she, too, is unhappy in her marriage... By this point, it's apparent that David's intentions shift from an interest in taking Bathsheba as a wife, to just plain taking Bathsheba... As usual, sin had its consequences, and David hadn't planned on that possibility...<br /><br />When a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine, David suspects that the Lord is punishing him and his people for his sin... But when Bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of Moses, David tries to cover up his sin... <br /><br />He sends word to Joab, the commander of his army, and ordered him to send to him Bathsheba's husband... David did something that was abominable in God's sight... He sends the man to the front line where he would be killed... <br /><br />The soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way, David marries his beloved Bathsheba in full regal splendor...<br /><br />God punishes the couple when Bathsheba's child dies soon after birth... Meanwhile, a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the Israelites - led by Nathan - blame the King for their plight...

"In order to avoid confusion, let me clarify a couple of points: I am not a red neck. I am not even a moderate nor a conservative. Quite on the contrary, I am a radical: a Libertarian. I'm not a WASP either, I was not even born in the States.<br /><br />Jorge Luis Borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry, and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry. This movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry, by and for show-offs; and I dare say, by and for people who have no sense of decency or, for that matter, respect for other people's life or death (especially when the victims are thought to be mostly 'bloody imperialists' killed in Yankee soil.) I even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes, nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive. Just plain awful. Why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism. Anybody who is serious about film-making (and serious about life and death) should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non-sequiturs. With two exceptions: the episode of Burkina Faso -- almost amusing --, and the one from India --which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack, on the basis that afterwards he didn't return home and that he was an American Muslim (and, truth be told, when the facts were known he was honored as a hero). All other nine episodes, essentially and extremely boring and emotionless, can be listed in two different categories:<br /><br />First: 'I don't care about the thousands of victims: Americans, foreigners, children, youngsters, adults, old-timers...' and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion. Makhmalbaf's (Iran); Lelouch's (France)  I'm afraid I'm going to commit an heresy since it's Lelouch's, but maybe, his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original; Tanovic's (Bosnia-Herzegovina); Gonzalez Inarritu's (Mexico); Gitaï's (Israel); Penn's (USA) <br /><br />Second: 'The bloody Yankees deserve it'. And can be resumed in frustration and hatred. Chahine (Egypt) vindicates the suicide bombers; Loach (UK) considers the 9/11 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the USA to the Chilean dictatorship headed by the serial-killer Augusto Pinochet, in fact someone should inform Mr. Loach that the victims of Pinochet were not related to Al-Qaida and that Chile is a South American country which sole existence Mr. Bin Laden should have ignored, he ought to be informed too that the American government sanctions against the Chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie's; and, Imamura (Japan) windingly points out that WWII is related the attack to the WTC. Imamura has at least been coherent in this: the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical, which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake. It pretends to be obscure. It is, instead, quite ludicrous.<br /><br />There's some kind of error shared by many, including some Americans, and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn't commercially screened in the States because of some kind of censorship. Nothing further from the truth: This movie wasn't screened in the States because it is a complete fiasco. A fiasco of the wackyest kind. Even in Buenos Aires, where Peronism and other forms of Fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants, and anti-Americanism is in vogue, the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters, and was applauded by a very select public: The usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally 'quaint' spectacles.

"Like most people, i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered all over the box, and the assumption (from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film) that this film is all about the Beast from the East kickin' ass for 90 minutes.<br /><br />However, to my disappointment, Chinese Hercules is to Bolo Yeung what No Retreat No Surrender was to Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger was to... erm, Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure on video box, minimum actual screen-time! Oh well! <br /><br />The storyline is pretty basic stuff, but it was well done - peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again. He then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy sack lifting prowess, causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter (dont quite know how that works but never mind). Meanwhile, the corrupt boss of the pier does a deal with gangsters, giving them exclusive use of the pier. As a result, the workers are thrown out on their ear and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, the gangster boss, and his hulking henchman Bolo Yeung.<br /><br />While the film was quite watchable (mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of Bolo), i had a few problems with it - firstly, the bad dubbing, but of course thats a given in old kung fu films. But also, the film tended to drag between the various fight-scenes. And as for the fight scenes themselves, i found them to be over-long, badly choreographed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), badly shot and at times performed by people who didn't seem to have any martial arts ability.... in fact, most of the fights in this film weren't 'fights' at all, just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance!<br /><br />Finally, the hero - played by Chen Hui Min. I've never seen any other films with this guy in, but at no point was i rooting for him. Not only did he look wimpy and on the verge of tears at all times, but i found his insistence on not fighting infuriating! I understood his reasoning, but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually, and fight! A bigger mystery was why this entire community of people were pinning their hopes on a guy they've never even seen fight! <br /><br />Really, the big saving grace in this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is he as huge and brutal as ever, he has some great, funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master-class on how to fight on film. The guy oozes screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares the life out of me, but i'm sure i wasn't the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for Bolo all through the end fight! <br /><br />All in all then, a below-average kung-fu film lifted several huge notches due to you-know-who. I've never met a person who didn't think Bolo Yeung was great. The man's a legend!!",0,like most people  i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty bolo yeung plastered all over the box  and the assumption  from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film  that this film is all about the beast from the east kickin ass for 90 minutes  however  to my disappointment  chinese hercules is to bolo yeung what no retreat no surrender was to jean claude van damme and fearless tiger was to    erm  bolo yeung   maximum exposure on video box  minimum actual screen time  oh well   the storyline is pretty basic stuff  but it was well done   peaceful kung fu fighter  played by chen hui min  accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again  he then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his co workers with his heavy sack lifting prowess  causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter  dont quite know how that works but never mind   meanwhile  the corrupt boss of the pier does a deal with gangsters  giving them exclusive use of the pier  as a result  the workers are thrown out on their ear and forced to live on the beach  where they unite against their boss  the gangster boss  and his hulking henchman bolo yeung  while the film was quite watchable  mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of bolo   i had a few problems with it   firstly  the bad dubbing  but of course thats a given in old kung fu films  but also  the film tended to drag between the various fight scenes  and as for the fight scenes themselves  i found them to be over long  badly choreographed  apparently by jackie chan    badly shot and at times performed by people who didnt seem to have any martial arts ability     in fact  most of the fights in this film werent fights at all  just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance  finally  the hero   played by chen hui min  ive never seen any other films with this guy in  but at no point was i rooting for him  not only did he look wimpy and on the verge of tears at all times  but i found his insistence on not fighting infuriating  i understood his reasoning  but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually  and fight  a bigger mystery was why this entire community of people were pinning their hopes on a guy theyve never even seen fight   really  the big saving grace in this film was the presence of bolo yeung  not only is he as huge and brutal as ever  he has some great  funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on how to fight on film  the guy oozes screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star  the guy scares the life out of me  but im sure i wasnt the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for bolo all through the end fight   all in all then  a below average kung fu film lifted several huge notches due to you know who  ive never met a person who didnt think bolo yeung was great  the mans a legend

"It WAS supposed to be the last Freddy movie (and it was for over 10 years)--you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done. But they turned out giving us the worst of the series (and that's saying a lot). The plot made no sense (I seriously can't remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them dead) and Freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual. The only remotely good bit about this was a brief (and funny) cameo by Johnny Depp (the first ""Nightmare"" movie was his first).<br /><br />Also I originally saw it in a theatre were the last section (reaccounting Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well--the 3-D was lousy--faded colors and the image going in and out of focus. Also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. EVERYBODY broke down laughing. Looks even worse on TV in 2-D. Pointless and stupid--very dull also.

"This story is a familiar one in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evicted if they don't catch the mouse (Jerry).

"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed movie, there is no doubt about that. And the acting is generally excellent, at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted.<br /><br />However, so many details small and large are just _wrong_ that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully. A small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene (no this does not spoil anything) where Mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell she's ringing is a fuurin, or wind chime - that is only left hanging outside of houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes didn't have doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate this to a movie made about America where a Christmas wreath is hanging on the door in July and no one thinks anything of it.) And don't even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha, which is vaguely pan-Asian/Chinese/kung-fu-ish, and nothing like real thing. I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too. <br /><br />So, I suppose that the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is what ""Miyako"" is), then I suppose the more you will enjoy this. I honestly think this movie could have been so much better...as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of ""exotic Japan"".",0,memoirs of a geisha is a beautifully filmed movie  there is no doubt about that  and the acting is generally excellent  at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted  however  so many details small and large are just  wrong  that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully  a small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene  no this does not spoil anything  where mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where sayuri lives  on a snowy winter day  the bell shes ringing is a fuurin  or wind chime   that is only left hanging outside of houses in japan in the summer  people in traditional japanese homes didnt have doorbells   they just opened the door and announced themselves   you may think this is such a trivial detail  but i would equate this to a movie made about america where a christmas wreath is hanging on the door in july and no one thinks anything of it   and dont even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha  which is vaguely pan asian chinese kung fu ish  and nothing like real thing  i think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too   so  i suppose that the less you know about japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in kyoto  which is what  miyako  is   then i suppose the more you will enjoy this  i honestly think this movie could have been so much better   as it is  its just another hollywood version of  exotic japan  
"""Home Room"" like ""Zero Day"" and ""Elephant"", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, ""Home Room"" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shooting. Making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers.<br /><br />Don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes, it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected ""Hill Street Blues"" episode. It is lame but bear with it, at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature. I recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes-there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film.<br /><br />Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features. Because the script of ""Home Room"" is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen.<br /><br />Ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing. Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's ""Sweet Surrender"") he goes out on, and the amazing editing of the final minute.<br /><br />The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main protagonists. Although Phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and Christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie Alicia to the lone shooter. If they ever re-cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed.<br /><br />A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and Ryan could have easily steered this film into cliché and predictability. But instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match, slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat back inside themselves. Deanna's ""I'm dying inside"" line just tears you apart-I can't think of a moment in any other film that I felt as intensely as that one. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia just as desperately resists. Deanna only makes progress when she retreats. The viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen.<br /><br />Ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?

"Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a funny, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />This is such a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. But there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. Don't miss this movie, set in '60s London. It's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked.""",1,talk about a dream cast   just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere   peter ustinov and maggie smith   together   in  hot millions   a funny  quirky comedy also starring karl malden  robert morley  and bob newhart  ustinov is an ex con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer  morley  and takes a position in a firm run by malden   with the goal of embezzlement in mind  its not smooth sailing  he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company  played by newhart  and his neighbor  maggie smith  who knows him at their place of residence under another name   becomes his secretary for a brief period  she cant keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment   all ending with her being fired  when newhart makes advances to her  she invites ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover up  but the two soon decide theyre made for each other  of course  she doesnt know ustinov is a crook  this is such a good movie   you cant help but love ustinov and smith and be fascinated by ustinovs machinations  his genius  and the ways he slithers out of trouble  but theres a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains  dont miss this movie  set in 60s london  its worth if it only to hear maggie smith whine   ive been sacked  
"The filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so filming of the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair. With such completely different viewpoints, any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds. The word ""peace"" did not have the same meaning to each of them. Peace to the Palestinian was freedom. Peace to the Israeli was security. With such an abyss, is this sort of film really worth much? I finished with the feeling that I had watched pointless propaganda -- both sides were unconvincing.",0,the filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories  so filming of the israeli side dominated  i was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers  the israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness  the palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair  with such completely different viewpoints  any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds  the word  peace  did not have the same meaning to each of them  peace to the palestinian was freedom  peace to the israeli was security  with such an abyss  is this sort of film really worth much  i finished with the feeling that i had watched pointless propaganda    both sides were unconvincing 
"First off...with names like Fred Olen Ray, Brinke Stevens and Jan-Michael Vincent, plus distributors like ""Rhino"" and ""Troma"" on the video box, you know what you're getting into with this one. B movie mania! If you're actually expecting to see a thriller ""based on Edgar Allan Poe,"" then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of Roger Corman 60s Poe films. This is pure, unadulterated sleaze (with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to ""The Premature Burial""), complete with lots of R-rated, ready-for-video sex and nudity. However, it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way...<br /><br />Brinke (who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes) plays rich, traumatized, insomniac housewife Victoria Monroe, whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father (Hoke Howell). Her worthless husband Terry (Jay Richardson) has racked up some serious gambling debt (owed to a gangster played by Robert Quarry) and, with help from his kinky, blonde, European-accented sexpot secretary Lisa (Delia Sheppard) plots to do away with Brinke for her money. Name-value actress Karen Black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist (she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this), 50s sci-fi/horror star Robert Clarke plays a doctor and family friend and Michael Berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living Vicki. Jan-Michael Vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as Brinke enters and exits the home.<br /><br />The kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before, the ending is an unintentional laugh riot (concluding with a direct rip-off of the Zuni Fetish Doll segment in TRILOGY OF TERROR) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head FX for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit. Brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic, but the biggest surprise of all is how good former Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is in her role. She stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here.",0,first off   with names like fred olen ray  brinke stevens and jan michael vincent  plus distributors like  rhino  and  troma  on the video box  you know what youre getting into with this one  b movie mania  if youre actually expecting to see a thriller  based on edgar allan poe   then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films  this is pure  unadulterated sleaze  with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to  the premature burial    complete with lots of r rated  ready for video sex and nudity  however  its certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way    brinke  who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes  plays rich  traumatized  insomniac housewife victoria monroe  whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father  hoke howell   her worthless husband terry  jay richardson  has racked up some serious gambling debt  owed to a gangster played by robert quarry  and  with help from his kinky  blonde  european accented sexpot secretary lisa  delia sheppard  plots to do away with brinke for her money  name value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist  shes way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this   50s sci fi horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still living vicki  jan michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home  the kill a spouse for the inheritance plot has been done a million times before  the ending is an unintentional laugh riot  concluding with a direct rip off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror  and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit  brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic  but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role  she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here

"This movie was made in Hungary i think. anyway,the countryside is gorgeous,the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating. their horsemanship is awesome. I got more into the native people, the farm life, and how heroic they were trying to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who where looking for these parachutists. They even sacrificed their life in several instances. the young orphan lad that Brady befriends was a sweet kid. you will marvel at the riding i think, and the action of trying to evade the Nazis. it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. Ladies have hankies handy, as you will be devastated at the end. i own it, and have watched it several times. in other words, not just a one time around flick. its a keeper....",1,this movie was made in hungary i think  anyway the countryside is gorgeous the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating  their horsemanship is awesome  i got more into the native people  the farm life  and how heroic they were trying to hide brady from the evil nazis who where looking for these parachutists  they even sacrificed their life in several instances  the young orphan lad that brady befriends was a sweet kid  you will marvel at the riding i think  and the action of trying to evade the nazis  it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others  ladies have hankies handy  as you will be devastated at the end  i own it  and have watched it several times  in other words  not just a one time around flick  its a keeper    
"I have very fond memories of this film, as I saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently it was deemed a failure - and is now practically forgotten (the pan-and scan videocassette - which never did justice to the picture or it's ambitious Panavision compositions is now out-of -print.) The film is very stylized (shades of YELLOW SUBMARINE) and admittedly uneven. Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished. The sad discarded blue camel (shades of Eeyore) and his blue song are truly heartwarming. Joe Raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful. Definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably (sadly) fall into total obscurity.",1,i have very fond memories of this film  as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and i was eight years old  apparently it was deemed a failure   and is now practically forgotten  the pan and scan videocassette   which never did justice to the picture or its ambitious panavision compositions is now out of  print   the film is very stylized  shades of yellow submarine  and admittedly uneven  some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished  the sad discarded blue camel  shades of eeyore  and his blue song are truly heartwarming  joe raposos songs are for the most part simply beautiful  definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably  sadly  fall into total obscurity 
"Probably encouraged by admirers of her much-better ""Orlando"", Potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and actually co-writes the music, including a mawkish love song. The film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her. But Potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango. Perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked. She just can't act, whether playing herself or not. Pretentious, over-ambitious, dull, and silly.",0,probably encouraged by admirers of her much better  orlando   potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way  she writes  directs  stars  and actually co writes the music  including a mawkish love song  the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her  but potters character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable  and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango  perhaps if she hadnt cast herself it might have worked  she just cant act  whether playing herself or not  pretentious  over ambitious  dull  and silly 
"I was delighted to finally see the release of Amazing Stories the first season on DVD. I had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series. For the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or when Sci-Fi would re-run the episodes. However, when Sci-Fi would host the re-runs, they generally stuck to the same episodes. There were a few outstanding episodes in Season One like The Mission that they didn't repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series ran? It says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at IMDb but I thought it ran longer than two years. If you loved the Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.",1,i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd  i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series  for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs 2 or 3 episode collections or when sci fi would re run the episodes  however  when sci fi would host the re runs  they generally stuck to the same episodes  there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didnt repeat  does anyone know exactly how long this series ran  it says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years  if you loved the twilight zone  night gallery and outer limits  you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase 
"When this cartoon first aired I was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent, boy was I wrong. I must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all those years ago. I watched a few episodes and two of them had Batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the Penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat the crap out of Batman and I watched another episode where Batman got his butt kicked again by the Joker, who apparently was using Jackie Chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja. Since when were the Joker or the Penguin ever a match for Batman ? and worse yet when were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's truly embarrassing, depressing and sad the way the image of Batman is portrayed in this show. The animation is awful and the dialog is terrible. Being a Batman fan since my boyhood I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost, because it doesn't project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really wanna see a classic Batman cartoon I strongly recommend Batman the Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S---T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and don't waste your time with this cartoon.",0,when this cartoon first aired i was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent  boy was i wrong  i must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching batman and robin with george clooney all those years ago  i watched a few episodes and two of them had batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the penguin who fought like jet li and beat the crap out of batman and i watched another episode where batman got his butt kicked again by the joker  who apparently was using jackie chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja  since when were the joker or the penguin ever a match for batman   and worse yet when were joker and penguin kung fu counterparts of jackie chan and jet li  its truly embarrassing  depressing and sad the way the image of batman is portrayed in this show  the animation is awful and the dialog is terrible  being a batman fan since my boyhood i can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost  because it doesnt project the true image of batman  this cartoon is more like a wannabe kung fu flick and if you really wanna see a classic batman cartoon i strongly recommend batman the animated series  but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of s   t  get batman  the animates series and dont waste your time with this cartoon 
"Judging by some of the comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one, but essentially an action movie.<br /><br />Whatever it is that I watched, it certainly didn't feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins.<br /><br />Now subtract the first (they never appear in the movie). Then simply let one of the assassins, the princess, become a rogue on a revenge trip. Add in a rebel love-interest with a guilty conscience. And you've got the ingredients.<br /><br />But they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be Sci-Fi on a low budget, what you're left with is a feeling of emptiness. The movie just does not feel like a movie, but a weird, incoherent, boring dream.<br /><br />Avoid.<br /><br />2/10",0,judging by some of the comments in imdb  i was expecting an action movie   perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one  but essentially an action movie  whatever it is that i watched  it certainly didnt feel like a movie  the story is simple and straightforward  even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated   take three interest groups  1  the government 2  the rebels 3  a group of assassins  now subtract the first  they never appear in the movie   then simply let one of the assassins  the princess  become a rogue on a revenge trip  add in a rebel love interest with a guilty conscience  and youve got the ingredients  but they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie  between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be sci fi on a low budget  what youre left with is a feeling of emptiness  the movie just does not feel like a movie  but a weird  incoherent  boring dream  avoid  2 10
"I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie, ""The Christmas Box"" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my ""new"" life. After seeing this movie I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who ""think"" they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child. This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop. I had a few calls after the movie, each call the same, ""That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back"" What a bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark.

"Once in a while, a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre. A film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come. `A Chinese Ghost Story' falls in this category. It is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980's; possibly one of the best ever made.<br /><br />The filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan. The story is engrossing and original. The villains are appropriately menacing and frightening. The sets are creepy and atmospheric. There is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house. But don't let the `horror' label scare you off, if you're not a fan of the genre. This film easily fits into many different categories.<br /><br />The screenwriter has deftly blended the drama, comedy, horror, kung fu, and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza. `A Chinese Ghost Story' is a beautiful epic love story told, thankfully, without the gratuitous nudity and/or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many Hollywood `love stories'. Those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fast-paced swordplay and `wire-fu'. If that's not enough, actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy. This film offers something for every film fan.<br /><br />Director Siu-Tung Ching and Producer Tsui Hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I cannot possibly think of a performer other than Cheung who could have portrayed Ling Choi Sin better (except maybe Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is enchanting as Lit Su Seen, the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of Cheung's character. Her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantankerous Taoist who aids the young lovers.<br /><br />On technical level, this film is very impressive, even by today's standards. The direction is superb. I wish that today's Hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching rather falling back on the usual MTV video or Pepsi commercial `directors'. The cinematography is gorgeous. You have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night. The special effects make-up is top-notch. In fact, most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy CGI ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films.<br /><br />Since its release, ""A Chinese Ghost Story"" has spawned two worthy sequels, a full-length animated movie, and countless imitations. None of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic, however. This film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out 10.<br /><br />",1,once in a while  a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre  a film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come   a chinese ghost story falls in this category  it is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980s  possibly one of the best ever made  the filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan  the story is engrossing and original  the villains are appropriately menacing and frightening  the sets are creepy and atmospheric  there is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house  but dont let the  horror label scare you off  if youre not a fan of the genre  this film easily fits into many different categories  the screenwriter has deftly blended the drama  comedy  horror  kung fu  and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza   a chinese ghost story is a beautiful epic love story told  thankfully  without the gratuitous nudity and or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many hollywood  love stories  those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fast paced swordplay and  wire fu  if thats not enough  actors leslie cheung and wu ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy  this film offers something for every film fan  director siu tung ching and producer tsui hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film  leslie cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor  but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian  i cannot possibly think of a performer other than cheung who could have portrayed ling choi sin better  except maybe chow yun fat   joey wang is enchanting as lit su seen  the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of cheungs character  her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable  wu ma is hilarious as the cantankerous taoist who aids the young lovers  on technical level  this film is very impressive  even by todays standards  the direction is superb  i wish that todays hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like siu tung ching rather falling back on the usual mtv video or pepsi commercial  directors  the cinematography is gorgeous  you have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night  the special effects make up is top notch  in fact  most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy cgi ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films  since its release   a chinese ghost story  has spawned two worthy sequels  a full length animated movie  and countless imitations  none of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic  however  this film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time  10 out 10 
"I will admit that I'm only a college student at this present time, an English major at that. At the time I saw this film I was a high school student--I want to say junior year but it may have been senior, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I can find in Discover and the like. I'm not a PhD by any means.<br /><br />That said...<br /><br />This movie is simply terrible. It's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is. My mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. I attempted to point out the various flaws and problems I'd seen with the films logic and science--and they are numerous--and she dismissed my claims because ""oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with PhDs."" In this case, apparently so.<br /><br />Leaving behind the fact that earning a PhD doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film. Leaving that behind, the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so.<br /><br />http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html",0,i will admit that im only a college student at this present time  an english major at that  at the time i saw this film i was a high school student  i want to say junior year but it may have been senior  hard to remember  my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course  an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like  im not a phd by any means  that said    this movie is simply terrible  its designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is  my mother is such a person and ever since shes seen this movie shes tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film  i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems id seen with the films logic and science  and they are numerous  and she dismissed my claims because  oh  so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds   in this case  apparently so  leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesnt necessarily require that a person be correct or  in fact  intelligent  leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film  leaving that behind  the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when  in fact  he completely opposed them  i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so  http   www intuitor com moviephysics bleep html

"Vodka Lemon is a charming, yet extremely uneven Arminian film that will delight some and bore others. Though reasonably well-crafted, the film lacks any real ""zing"", relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art-house viewer. The film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled.

"In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie.<br /><br />Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).<br /><br />Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido's trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?<br /><br />A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that I have seen.<br /><br />Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead's Bub, and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentionsRay, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!<br /><br />This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",1,in an alternate 1950s  where an outbreak of the undead  caused by a mysterious space dust  has been contained through the use of special electronic collars  a young loner  timmy  finds a friend in fido  billy connelly   his familys recently acquired domesticated zombie  fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy  whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son  or for his hot to trot wife  played by the gorgeous carrie anne moss  having been psychologically scarred as a child  when he was forced to shoot his own father  who tried to eat him    timmy runs into a spot of bother  however  when his putrid pals collar goes on the blink  and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour  with the authorities on fidos trail  trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies  and his mother forming a bond with their undead house help  will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend  a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick  fido is a thoroughly entertaining  deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour  taking the romero zombie verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius  and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole reanimated dead theme that i have seen  connellys fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame  along with day of the deads bub  and return of the living deads tarman  it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse  but the big yins performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus  the rest of the cast also give commendable performances  with young ksun ray  as timmy  and ms moss deserving special mentionsray  because  for one so young  he puts in a particularly assured turn  and moss because she is so bloody yummy  this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week  the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead   and  to my surprise  it is also the best  director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future  8 5 out of 10  rounded up to 9 for imdb 
"Boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created!

The characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals. The sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of Media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this ""production"". Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor who has from the days of ""Benson"" to this production held his own in the field of entertainment, always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production. Captain Kirk ""is"". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his acting ability, however he should go back to his XXX origins such as ""Crash"" as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction.

"This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?<br /><br />Poor film making aside, the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape, murder and self harm this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out.

"As a Westerner watching another culture's view and tradition of marriag, I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. As said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. There's song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.",1,as a westerner watching another cultures view and tradition of marriag  i found just married mesmerizing and delightful  the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult  especially in this modern age  yet this is the case in this hindi film  told with humor  and fresh perspective  we learn of abhay and ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon  as said  it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place  we see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night  and how they try to forge a bond  even though they do not know one another  we see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday  from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment  theres song  witty dialog  poignant moments  blending and comparison of new ways and tradition  watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story  yet it is still a delight to watch  granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived  however the overall movie was worth watching 
"Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films, such ""Do The Right Thing,"" most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue.<br /><br />What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified, but Christians? Hey, it's ""open season"" on them.<br /><br />Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. Hey, folks, here's another Bible reader and look what he''s like! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.<br /><br />He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward white people doesn't help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /><br />Hey, Spike: start ""doing the right thing"" and leave your prejudices in the closet.

"Before the Internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the Web is full of evil is the idea behind it.Unfortunately thats all it was-the generally opinion that nowadays the Web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life. Since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computer.The point? Just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence.Which is basically what spam is without the violence-its conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isn't a priority, We see the Internet get worse by the week-the social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which ARE illegal. So the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing-there actually IS a site called Horrorvision which is a porn site-but this one KILLS the people who enter its portals. The story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion. The definitive movie on this theme of destroying an Internet Service Provider has yet to be made but clearly many DO need destroying as they won't be shut down when there's money to be made. Calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not frightens",0,before the internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the web is full of evil is the idea behind it unfortunately thats all it was the generally opinion that nowadays the web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life  since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computer the point  just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence which is basically what spam is without the violence its conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isnt a priority  we see the internet get worse by the week the social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which are illegal  so the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing there actually is a site called horrorvision which is a porn site but this one kills the people who enter its portals  the story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion  the definitive movie on this theme of destroying an internet service provider has yet to be made but clearly many do need destroying as they wont be shut down when theres money to be made  calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not frightens

"On 24 October 1955, the hard-work geologist of the Hadley Oil Company Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) meets the executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of her boss Bill Ryan in New York and invites her to go to a conference with the alcoholic playboy and son of a tycoon Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way of the meeting, he confesses that they had traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the wish of the reckless Kyle, who is his best friend since their childhood, of eating a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love for Lucy, and Kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and proposes Lucy. They get married and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and has a non- corresponded crush on Mitch that sees her as a sister. One year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be sterile and starts drinking again. The jealous Marylee poisons Kyle telling that his wife and Mitch are having a love affair. When Lucy finds that she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the baby belongs to Mitch and his mistrust leads to a tragedy. <br /><br />""Written on the Wind"" is an overrated melodramatic soap opera, with artificial characters and situations. There are at least two great movies with characters with drinking problem: ""The Lost Weekend"" (1945) with stunning performance of Ray Milland and ""Days of Wine and Roses"" (1962) with awesome performance of Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and his character's motives for drinking are shallow and clichés. In the end, the forgettable ""Written on the Wind"" is entertaining only and never a feature to be nominated to the Oscar.

"It would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie-ready' as ""The House Next Door"" to be adapted for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason could be problems designing 'the house'. The house in this Lifetime film is really so ugly that I can't imagine anyone buying it. In fact it's so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to put down when I came across it around ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life, and this is one of the book's strengths. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon..(or the devil personified) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. However, it is a downbeat book for the most part, and I don't think that appeals to the people who run Lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come. A better house..better music..a better screenplay and darker lighting...would certainly help.",0,it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie ready as  the house next door  to be adapted for film or television  the book was copyrighted in 1978  one reason could be problems designing the house  the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i cant imagine anyone buying it  in fact its so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built  im not crazy about horror genre books  but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago  the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life  and this is one of the books strengths  they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon   or the devil personified  without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book  however  it is a downbeat book for the most part  and i dont think that appeals to the people who run lifetime  maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come  a better house  better music  a better screenplay and darker lighting   would certainly help 
"Why does this movie fall WELL below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humourless script. A slim/average looking Travolta (looking rather dapper in black I must say, even with a HUGE mullet) and Gross both act very well as two young-ish 'slick-dressed' but nevertheless dimwitted New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. Other than that, the rest of the film is just boring to watch. It is SO dull that it's really not worth knowing what happens in the film's climax on any level. Kelly Preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband-to-be Travolta is one of the film's few pleasures. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch as struggling KGB honcho ""Bob Smith"". Personally, I think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from NY to 'Indian Springs, Nebraska' (which is in the former Soviet Union?)--you'll understand if you see the movie... Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release. I guess Paramount stalled on releasing the movie until January 1989 because of the unbelievable plot. It was reported they deemed it ""unreleasable"". Nevertheless, this $6,000,000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing $163,000 in revenue as it was released only BRIEFLY in places like Texas and Colorado before heading straight-to-video.

"I have read many comments on this site criticizing The Blob for being cheesy and or campy. The movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget, locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious. That fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits. For what it was meant to be, this film is excellent. I have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts, Blair Witch Project was one of them, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and thoroughly entertaining. The scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy. The scene in the doctor's office with the Blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. Bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone out there to take $120,000.00, inflated for today's dollar value, and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the Blob. It just can't be done.

"I was curious to know how critics responded to this rousing, inspiring film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was dismayed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that is our nation's film critics had given the film an average 43% (or ""Rotten"") rating.<br /><br />All I can say is, if this movie doesn't move you, you have no heart. (It's interesting to note that the same film on the same website got a 74% rating from viewers).<br /><br />Not that the opinion of critics is all THAT important to me. After all, I can't think of a more useless, overpaid profession. Some schmo gets paid to go to the movies (what a tough life) and does the same thing everyone else on the planet does: forms an opinion. But these chumps have a way of coming across like their opinion somehow matters more than yours, and even worse, they love to hate.<br /><br />I'll grant you that this movie is old fashioned (well, except for the f-bombs), syrupy, and a little predictable... after all, you know right from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., portraying real-life Navy hero Carl Brashear, is going to triumph (eventually) at every turn simply by the way he comes across: determined and plucky; strong-willed and optimistic.<br /><br />But his performance and that of De Niro (as Billy Sunday, a composite character of several real-life people) are so strong, so inspiring, that you'll be on your feet cheering many of the film's scenes, especially the courtroom climax. You'd have to be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes. Like our nation's film critics. Michael Rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet-natured, stuttering diving student that befriends Gooding's Brashear. If anyone has seen ""Higher Learning"", this character totally redeems that character.<br /><br />Anyway, this confirms what I've always felt: don't listen to critics.

"Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...<br /><br />Another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat, let loose by another one of those facilities conducting mad science. Gereco Biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research, accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate.<br /><br />B-movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill ""genetic mistake monster movie"". Costas Mandylor evokes Mick Dundee, Aussie accent, hat, big ass knife, the works, as a croc specialist hired by Gereco executive Joanna Pacula(..wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people). Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter, who works at the animal shelter. Soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures(..his brother is a victim of the croc). Of course, this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.<br /><br />The croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low grade variety. In regards to Roger Corman productions dealing with renegade dino-monsters, I stick with Carnosaur.

"In the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area (or whatever the title for that Oscar is), ""Holes"" has credibility. I think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material. If the author can't write a screenplay to save their life, then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it. Aside from that, this review is about ""Holes"".<br /><br />The reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within. (1) Louis Sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay. I watched the movie and then read the book and both didn't reek incoherence or stupidity. Some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums. (2) The best performance award goes to Shia LaBeouf for his portrayal as the main character. He ""dug"" himself into the role. I wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion. (3) To ratchet up the suspense a bit, Andrew Davis was brought in. This is the man that made Harrison Ford run hard and run fast. He also can make Steven Seagal smash some heads. As for this film, he made Shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes. In other words, he can make an ""action-packed"" movie and make it well even if ""action"" isn't the main genre isn't ""action"". (4) My second favorite performance goes to Jon Voight as Mr. Sir. Sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer. When Voight uttered the line ""Once upon a time..."", I must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny. He is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent. (5) Tim Blake Nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script. This is probably the second best role I have seen him in (second only to 'O Brother Where Art Thou?'). (6) I love the choice of settings for the movie. I didn't know California was that dry or that barren. I guess population and land area figures both can be misleading. (7) The overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water. One could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day. (8) The rest of the cast should deserve a box of Kudos bars as well. Sigourney Weaver, Henry Winkler, Khleo Thomas, Jake M. Smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well. Great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble. (9) I like a movie that doesn't explain anything right away. When Stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats, it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie. (10) Disney Pictures (not Touchstone, DISNEY!!) needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films. It was palatable for me and I am a college student. The last mature juvenile Disney film I saw was ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" and ""Holes"" possibly exceeds it (like the election in 2000, it's still to close to call). Disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it. Ten reasons give a score of ten!<br /><br />All in all, ""Holes"" is one of my favorite Disney films and probably one of the best this year (granted this movie may not be Oscar material but whoever said Oscar material is the best material?). In terms of being a movie from a book I have read, this ranks behind ""Fight Club"" on my list (which is on top). For being a film I saw in 2003, this is in the top five (somewhere behind ""Mystic River""). Compared against ""Harry Potter"", Stanley Yelnats easily takes a shovel to Harry's head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to Potter's nose. Everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains.

"I had never read Gary Paulsen's novel, Hatchet, for which 'A Cry in the Wild' is the adaptation of, so I can't make any comparisons to the book. I will, however, say that as a film on its own, adaptation or no adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters.<br /><br />Think of 'A Cry in the Wild' as a less luxurious, teenage mountaineer (was Quincy, California the only place this was filmed?) version of 'Cast Away.' Jared Rushton is 13-year-old Brian Roebson, a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father, until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain, leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself.<br /><br />There are basically three parts to the film. The obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters, namely Brian and his mom. <br /><br />The next third of the movie (which really consumes nearly all of the film) is that of Brian ""roughing it."" These scenes contain no particularly amazing action, nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape. Nothing to put you on edge, no real encounters (except a brisk confrontation with a cub), and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. You might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness Brian dealing with his situation through first, primitive means, and then more improved ones (using tools, etc) for his survival. It is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation, and that is pretty much about it. In other words, they put no meat on the Paulsen's words when they translated them into a visual media.<br /><br />And, of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue.<br /><br />There is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time, however. Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created a rocky, awkward relationship between them. However, for the most part, it is only explained in brief, intermittent, minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video. Any minute, the singer from Jefferson Starship, should chime in an start singing 'Sara.' Other than what the viewer can draw from the implications, or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters, whether or not it really had anything to do with Brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie. These are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and, for me, almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more! <br /><br />It certainly was not, for me, a good adventure tale. But, for fans of Jared Rushton, it was one of the last few movies he made. So, watch it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.",0,i had never read gary paulsens novel  hatchet  for which a cry in the wild is the adaptation of  so i cant make any comparisons to the book  i will  however  say that as a film on its own  adaptation or no adaptation  it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters  think of a cry in the wild as a less luxurious  teenage mountaineer  was quincy  california the only place this was filmed   version of cast away  jared rushton is 13 year old brian roebson  a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father  until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain  leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself  there are basically three parts to the film  the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters  namely brian and his mom   the next third of the movie  which really consumes nearly all of the film  is that of brian  roughing it   these scenes contain no particularly amazing action  nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape  nothing to put you on edge  no real encounters  except a brisk confrontation with a cub   and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen  you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first  primitive means  and then more improved ones  using tools  etc  for his survival  it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation  and that is pretty much about it  in other words  they put no meat on the paulsens words when they translated them into a visual media  and  of course  the third part of the movie is his rescue  there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time  however  some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky  awkward relationship between them  however  for the most part  it is only explained in brief  intermittent  minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video  any minute  the singer from jefferson starship  should chime in an start singing sara  other than what the viewer can draw from the implications  or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative  we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters  whether or not it really had anything to do with brians survival adventure in the third part of the movie  these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and  for me  almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more   it certainly was not  for me  a good adventure tale  but  for fans of jared rushton  it was one of the last few movies he made  so  watch it purely for nostalgia  if nothing else 
"What the F*@# was this I just watched? Steven STOP!! Please! This movie is insatiably bad and silly. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) wish-they-were-vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength.? OK? Oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! Even still in this movie however, to quell Seagals have-to-have-the-last-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a$$ ego, HE is somehow stronger than they are. However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him. Come on, I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer, but these are super human strength people. Oh and get this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine! Oh My GO... And worst than all of that! Yes, there is a worse than that. He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face. They obviously sound nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end. This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs down! Redemeption qualities? Well I guess so, I will be fair in that aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. The women all were quite attractive IMO. Still, and I said STILL, it does not make up for the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) rip off! The director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business.

"This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of ""Voyage to the Earth's Core"" and ""Mysterious Island"".

Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp ""Ogar"" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in ""People that Time Forgot"".

"""Witchery"" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""The Evil Dead"". The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.",0, witchery  might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80s but  luckily enough  it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects  an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices  honestly the screenplay doesnt make one iota of sense  but who cares when linda blair  with an exploded hairstyle  portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer  who cant seem to get laid  in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo  sewn shut lips  upside down crucifixions  vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune  eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts  the young couple is there to investigate the places dark history  the dysfunctional family  with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are  considers re opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex  theyre forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways  everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window  anyway  the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin off of  the evil dead   the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film  theres something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried 
"Tiempo de Valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre, but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting, tremendous rapport between its leads, and outstanding photography. Diego Peretti stars as Dr. Silverstein, a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy. Diaz has been suspended from duty, but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, though Peretti isn't as classically handsome as Hill. Remarkably, even at almost two hours in length Tiempo de Valientes doesn't wear out its welcome, and indeed writer-director Damian Szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film's charming coda. All in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence.",1,tiempo de valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre  but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting  tremendous rapport between its leads  and outstanding photography  diego peretti stars as dr  silverstein  a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz  luis luque   whos been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy  diaz has been suspended from duty  but hes the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated  silverstein and diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving argentinas intelligence community and some uranium  and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own  peretti and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer  though peretti isnt as classically handsome as hill  remarkably  even at almost two hours in length tiempo de valientes doesnt wear out its welcome  and indeed writer director damian szifron sets up a potential sequel in the films charming coda  all in all  a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence

"ELEPHANT WALK was a thoroughly dull film and I really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film. Considering the money and cast, you'd sure expect the film to be a lot better, though I also question the odd casting of Dana Andrews as a man who is in love with Elizabeth Taylor. It's not just the age difference but I just can't see the pair as a couple. Perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting Miss Taylor for Vivian Leigh at the last minute (due to Miss Leigh's deteriorating mental condition)--though I also have a hard time visualizing Andrews and Leigh as well. In addition, for an English woman, Miss Taylor doesn't even seem to try using an accent.<br /><br />The film begins with Peter Finch and Taylor meeting and marrying in England. Their plan is to return to Finch's tea plantation in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and at first it seems like a good life. However, there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her. On top of that, once back home, Finch behaves like a boorish jerk and Taylor is miserable. Neighbor Andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her. However, Taylor isn't yet ready to abandon her marriage. But, through the course of the film Finch treats Liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave...when out of the blue, Cholera strikes the plantation. So it's up to Andrews, Finch and Taylor to work together to save the day--though by this point I really didn't care, as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters, the dialog is pretty dull and you can't understand why Taylor didn't leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell.<br /><br />The film isn't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by Paramount, the film is a sluggish mess. I particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location, many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected (and grainy) shot that wasn't integrated well. In one scene, for instance, Taylor, Finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green. Then, when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them, the grass is brown! It's clear they really are NOT in Ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining Buddha. My advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake. Despite its budget, it's just not a very good or inspired film.<br /><br />By the way, could Miss Taylor have been pregnant during part of this film? In some scenes (particularly at the beginning) she's wearing billowy clothes, has a double-chin and looks puffy. This isn't a criticism--after all, women do get pregnant! But if you look carefully, you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Also by the way, the basic plot in many ways is similar to GIANT--a great Taylor film indeed! It's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much.",0,elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film  considering the money and cast  youd sure expect the film to be a lot better  though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor  its not just the age difference but i just cant see the pair as a couple  perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute  due to miss leighs deteriorating mental condition   though i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well  in addition  for an english woman  miss taylor doesnt even seem to try using an accent  the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england  their plan is to return to finchs tea plantation in ceylon  sri lanka  and at first it seems like a good life  however  there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her  on top of that  once back home  finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable  neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her  however  taylor isnt yet ready to abandon her marriage  but  through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave   when out of the blue  cholera strikes the plantation  so its up to andrews  finch and taylor to work together to save the day  though by this point i really didnt care  as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters  the dialog is pretty dull and you cant understand why taylor didnt leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell  the film isnt particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount  the film is a sluggish mess  i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location  many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected  and grainy  shot that wasnt integrated well  in one scene  for instance  taylor  finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green  then  when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them  the grass is brown  its clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha  my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake  despite its budget  its just not a very good or inspired film  by the way  could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film  in some scenes  particularly at the beginning  shes wearing billowy clothes  has a double chin and looks puffy  this isnt a criticism  after all  women do get pregnant  but if you look carefully  youll see what i mean  also by the way  the basic plot in many ways is similar to giant  a great taylor film indeed  its amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much 
"I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before heading into work. If you've any interest in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If that doesn't peak your interest, well, I'm afraid you'll wish that YOU were the one about to be enveloped in flames, because this movie is pretty bad. The acting, to begin with, is awful, awful, awful. The characters are all completely obnoxious, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-grade, Sci-Fi movie.

"Why did I go to see this film? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? Additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston's involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.<br /><br />However, as my ""one line Summary"" suggests, I was Disappointed. For various reasons;<br /><br />Reason 1: It wasn't funny. In a 2hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking ""I really should have got some ice-cream"". I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gem's such as 'The Truman Show' , 'Liar Liar' , 'Me, Myself and Irene' , 'Dumb and Dumber' , 'The Mask', and the 'Ace Ventura' films then produces, in Bruce Nolan's own words, such a mediocre film?<br /><br />Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! She's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.<br /><br />Reason 3: One word - Cliché<br /><br />Reason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal. ""A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!"" God tells Bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. Additionally, I still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?<br /><br />In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.",0,why did i go to see this film  honestly  because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter  so do you really blame me for expecting that again  additionally  the premise  the funny trailer  his co star jennifer anistons involvement  and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me  however  as my  one line summary  suggests  i was disappointed  for various reasons  reason 1  it wasnt funny  in a 2hour movie  i laughed for about 5 10minutes   all together  the rest of the time i sat thinking  i really should have got some ice cream   i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films  but what does he really expect when he makes gems such as the truman show   liar liar   me  myself and irene   dumb and dumber   the mask  and the ace ventura films then produces  in bruce nolans own words  such a mediocre film  reason 2  jennifer anistons role was criminally underwritten  i mean hello  shes been around in the public eye for about ten years now  and in this film she gets about four lines to say  wrong  reason 3  one word   cliché reason 4  a casual deployment of specifically american references   jimmy hoffa  walter cronkite sweeps week   is a clue to the films specifically home grown appeal   a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education   thats a miracle  want to see a miracle soon  be the miracle   god tells bruce  a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us  but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety  additionally  i still go to school  and that statement suggests me and all of my friends are miracles   or maybe it just means we have brains  in this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total calamity  but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards 
"This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. I love the backwoods feel of this movie. The movie is very realistic and believable. This seems to take place in another era, maybe the late 60's or early 70's. Henry Thomas works well with the young baby. Very moving story and worth a look.",1,this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen  i love the backwoods feel of this movie  the movie is very realistic and believable  this seems to take place in another era  maybe the late 60s or early 70s  henry thomas works well with the young baby  very moving story and worth a look 
"I must admit I burst out laughing when I saw one reviewer compare this to LOTR. Well yes, if you exclude the dwarfs, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the classy direction and everything else. Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a $20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk.<br /><br />As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.<br /><br />I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to walk dogs?",0,i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr  well yes  if you exclude the dwarfs  the cast of thousands  the great special effects  the big battles  the strong characterization  the decent plot  the good acting  the classy direction and everything else  which leaves you with the walking  and boy  does this film do walking  if mr piano had his way  this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside  but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble  youve never seen so much walking in a movie  if this really had a  20m budget  most of it must have gone on mr pianos shoes  because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does  which explains why theres no money left for decent effects  a decent video camera or proper actors  honestly  its like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes  even on fast forward  this is a looonnnggg walk  as for the sci fi stuff  i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film  they only get in the way of the walking  which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story  i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs 
"I know Anime. I've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award; this isn't an exaggeration - I've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who'd only ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three. Personally, I'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing. In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think that that is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken.",1,i know anime  ive been into it long before it became a national phenomenon  i loved ranma before most people knew what dragonball z even was  and just so you know im not bragging about my  let me say this  out of all the animes ive seen  castle in the sky is by far one of the best  its obvious people say spirited away is the best  but i really disagree  most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award  this isnt an exaggeration   ive shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people whod only ever seen spirited away  and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three  personally  id never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke  until i finally saw castle in the sky  i still think that the prior is the better of the two  but castle in the sky is easily on par with it  in many ways  castle has major elements that mononoke was missing  in either case  if youve only seen spirited away  and think that that is miyazakis best film  be prepared to have your earth shaken 
"The first von Trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. Because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. The society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. By coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The atmosphere is astounding. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene.

"The Lady in Cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's. The writing, not the acting, is at center stage. Did I say - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. Broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (camp- wise). Most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors. The action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers. Amazing to note they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The musical score, wait . . . was there a score? Well, you get the point. Watch it with friends who want a good laugh. it's full of them.",0,the lady in cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60s  the writing  not the acting  is at center stage  did i say   pure camp  prepare to be offended if you are female or gay  broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day  camp  wise   most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors  the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs  and lanie kazan and racquel welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers  amazing to note they were both 28 years old and mr  sinatra was 53  the musical score  wait       was there a score  well  you get the point  watch it with friends who want a good laugh  its full of them 
"Warning: This review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very dull movie. Where the heck are the Graboids??? <br /><br />Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes I'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a ""character study"". Unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Drago's character who is given too few lines, too little to do and in the end too little screen time. What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch. However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /><br />On the plus side when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long. Pretty good for straight to video. But after watching it I'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any. Was there a rush to get this movie made? I think not, more time could have and should have been spent on the script.<br /><br />I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with....Tremors!!! What luck I thought, pay for #4 get #1 for free. Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can't imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4. For fans of the series it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists.<br /><br />Tremors 4: The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10.",0,warning  this review contains minor spoilers  well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas  im a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare  tremors 4  the legends begins  however  is a very dull movie  where the heck are the graboids     due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes im convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a  character study   unfortunately there isnt one interesting character in the movie except for billy dragos character who is given too few lines  too little to do and in the end too little screen time  what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer  whenever there wasnt any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and or watch  however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute   on the plus side when the graboids  dirt dragons in this movie  are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets  i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long  pretty good for straight to video  but after watching it im sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long  there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesnt further the plot any  was there a rush to get this movie made  i think not  more time could have and should have been spent on the script  i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale with    tremors    what luck i thought  pay for  4 get  1 for free  well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free  i cant imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4  for fans of the series its best to forget that tremors 4  the legend begins even exists  tremors 4  the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10 
"I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she did very well acting her role. Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host, and model, it was not surprising. I was left wondering why she was killed, and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it.<br /><br />I wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience. I tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn't my favorite genre, but felt like I had outgrown the gags. It seemed to drag out in some places, leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had, and, like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Having written a couple of scripts, I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions, how many movies you have seen & studied, and those you relate with at a point in time.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating.",0,i saw this movie primarily to see brooke burke  as jill   who i had meet briefly in la at a modeling trade show  in her first feature film  i was hoping to see more of her  but thought she did very well acting her role  since she is such a beautiful and poised tv host  and model  it was not surprising  i was left wondering why she was killed  and what happened as a result  maybe i just missed it  i wasnt really sure about the genre of this movie  and although i liked the actors i felt like it was for a college audience  i tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasnt my favorite genre  but felt like i had outgrown the gags  it seemed to drag out in some places  leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had  and  like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending  having written a couple of scripts  i know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions  how many movies you have seen   studied  and those you relate with at a point in time  in a nutshell  i found it interesting  but not a satisfying plot and ending for me  if jill  brooke burke  would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyones ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating 
"What a waste! This movie could have really been something decent, but the writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical recreation of late 70s decadence was well crafted, but overall, this movie was a big waste of time. Instead, the movie to watch, that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame, is the great BOOGIE NIGHTS.",0,what a waste  this movie could have really been something decent  but the writing  in particular  is crap  and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting  mike meyers was good  and the historical recreation of late 70s decadence was well crafted  but overall  this movie was a big waste of time  instead  the movie to watch  that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame  is the great boogie nights 
"this movie is made for Asian/Chinese market, targeting particularly fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest music star in Asian.<br /><br />Jay Chou is a very talented song writer/singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he did appear in several big-budget productions (""initial D"", ""Curse of the Golden Flower ""). Amazingly, he won both golden horse (taiwan) and Hong Kong film awards for ""initial D"".<br /><br />The supporting cast are very well chosen, which appeals basically everyone from China. The cast including many famous movie/TV actors, singers, even sport commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents.<br /><br />The biggest mistake is that Chu took over both director and writer position. He has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non-coherent scripts. With his poor directing and lam story, the whole talented cast, fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted.<br /><br />However, the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars, maybe even more in Asian, which made this one of the biggest box office success in Asian.<br /><br />The bottom line is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted, or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of Jay Chou.",0,this movie is made for asian chinese market  targeting particularly fans of jay chou  one of the biggest music star in asian  jay chou is a very talented song writer singer  he is mediocre as an actor  although he did appear in several big budget productions   initial d    curse of the golden flower     amazingly  he won both golden horse  taiwan  and hong kong film awards for  initial d   the supporting cast are very well chosen  which appeals basically everyone from china  the cast including many famous movie tv actors  singers  even sport commentator  huang jianxiang from china   however  they were not given enough time to show their talents  the biggest mistake is that chu took over both director and writer position  he has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non coherent scripts  with his poor directing and lam story  the whole talented cast  fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted  however  the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars  maybe even more in asian  which made this one of the biggest box office success in asian  the bottom line is  you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted  or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of jay chou

"To be fair, I expected car chases in this film. There was only really one, but apart from that, 'Freeway' was a great movie which I am glad to own on DVD. The only really big names in the cast are HOMICIDE's Richard Belzer as the radio psychiatrist and B-Movie villain par-excellance Billy Drago as the Revelation-quoting Freeway Killer. But the rest of the cast generally give good performances. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a bit of guts. She could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo.<br /><br />Russo, I'm afraid, comes across as rather wooden, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, isn't very well fleshed out save for a back story Sunny is given by his former commanding officer. The tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely LA freeway at night with the killer prowling its' length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension, and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed. I don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose.

"My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970's. We absolutely adored it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual American re-runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres... you get the idea). It had a similar feel to The Avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also British and in the spy/adventure genre).<br /><br />I would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. I've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I'd imagined its whole existence. But the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.",1,my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re runs of it one summer in the 1970s  we absolutely adored it  there was something so exotic and mysterious about it  especially when compared to the usual american re runs  petticoat junction  green acres    you get the idea   it had a similar feel to the avengers  not too much of a surprise  since it was also british and in the spy adventure genre   i would love to see it again now    hopefully it holds up  ive mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it  so i began to wonder if id imagined its whole existence  but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it  hopefully it will find a new generation of fans 
"This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess, and you'd rather be watching anything, ANYTHING else. At least that's what it was like when I was in elementary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Granted, I haven't seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone: You'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. Trust me, pick anything else. Even though the topic is kind of controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that I can't remember anything about it except that I disliked it so strongly that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you against it.",0,this movie is a bad memory from my childhood  this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you cant go out for recess  and youd rather be watching anything  anything else  at least thats what it was like when i was in elementary school  i just remember hating this movie  granted  i havent seen it in 15 years or so  and they probably dont use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone  youd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them  trust me  pick anything else  even though the topic is kind of controversial  the plot is so tame and slow that i cant remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here  15 years later  i felt the need to warn all of you against it 
"I was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons. For the first half hour it's actually pretty decent. Although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video, its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad. In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao (another recent Dominican film) which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected. The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole, which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic. Unfortunately I don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter, and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them. About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits. Not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge, space age, CGI effects dating to what I'm guessing would be the 70's, but the whole plot just goes down the drain. The rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations, and clever one liners. To top it all off (and I guess I should warn you now **SPOILER ALERT**) it all turns out to be a dream. Oh my who didn't see that coming? Oh man I almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie. Well after about an hour into it I start thinking ""hmmmm something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be??"" and then it hits me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE WAS TAKEN FROM A VIDEO GAME CALLED KING OF FIGHTER 95.<br /><br />When oh when DR will you give us a film we can call a work of art?!?! Perhaps a comedy to match France's Amelie, or an action flick to match Thailand's Ong-Bak, an animation as Akira was to Japan, a witty crime thriller as Layer Cake was to England, or a socio-awakening journey as Waking Life had here in the states.<br /><br />...i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of DR, search Los Jodedores and you'll know what I'm talking about.",0,i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons  for the first half hour its actually pretty decent  although the acting isnt any better then that which you would find in a rap video  its kinda funny and the production value doesnt seem half bad  in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao  another recent dominican film  which turned out to be much much better than i expected  the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole  which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic  unfortunately i dont think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter  and they fing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them  about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits  not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge  space age  cgi effects dating to what im guessing would be the 70s  but the whole plot just goes down the drain  the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations  and clever one liners  to top it all off  and i guess i should warn you now   spoiler alert    it all turns out to be a dream  oh my who didnt see that coming  oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie  well after about an hour into it i start thinking  hmmmm something just doesnt seem right about the sound track but what can it be    and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95  when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art     perhaps a comedy to match frances amelie  or an action flick to match thailands ong bak  an animation as akira was to japan  a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england  or a socio awakening journey as waking life had here in the states     i would give it a 1 but ive seen much worse come out of dr  search los jodedores and youll know what im talking about 
"Is this the ""worse"" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe, at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom 5. I mean, this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense. Seeing something that makes you go mad? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feel to it, the music is heightened, almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress, to the point that it sucks. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion's or anything but Medusin's, these are very boring aliens to make an episode around. McCoy gets to utter his famous phrase ""He's Dead, Jim"". Spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but Kirk does not. They go through that freaking ""barrier"" now for the third time that I can remember, boring. At least season three's next episodes would be ""Spectre Of The Gun"", and ""Day of The Dove"" and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the color purple, its kind of a pinkish purple, like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the gangway that is normally grey is now purple. We never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see, I noticed it in several episodes, it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode, in the ships corridor is pretty lame.",0,is this the  worse  star trek tos episode  maybe  at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom 5  i mean  this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense  seeing something that makes you go mad  give me a break  this episode also has a different feel to it  the music is heightened  almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress  to the point that it sucks  give me some klingons  gorns  tholians  romulans  higher beings like triskelions or anything but medusins  these are very boring aliens to make an episode around  mccoy gets to utter his famous phrase  hes dead  jim   spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but kirk does not  they go through that freaking  barrier  now for the third time that i can remember  boring  at least season threes next episodes would be  spectre of the gun   and  day of the dove  and others to follow  making trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans  personal observations  trek loved to use the color purple  its kind of a pinkish purple  like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment  the gangway that is normally grey is now purple  we never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see  i noticed it in several episodes  it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode  in the ships corridor is pretty lame 
It's really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed. But I'm glad I did not miss it.<br /><br />They should re-release it with a lot more publicity. I do not think they did anything to promote it. Great work Paxton.<br /><br />,1,its really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed  but im glad i did not miss it  they should re release it with a lot more publicity  i do not think they did anything to promote it  great work paxton 
"Superb movie. Very good photography of 1969/70 Bolton, which seems now to be a different world. Thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production. James Mason a real first class star.

"Saw this today with my 8 year old. I thought it was cute. I agree with the other poster that it wasn't anything like the book that I can remember, but we still enjoyed it. All of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining. Billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day. If he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the movie is set up to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and pukes at almost anything. Hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms. Good message about standing up to bullies and of course, a sappy happy ending.",1,saw this today with my 8 year old  i thought it was cute  i agree with the other poster that it wasnt anything like the book that i can remember  but we still enjoyed it  all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining  billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day  if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants  the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything  hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms  good message about standing up to bullies and of course  a sappy happy ending 
"'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in 1988. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing') but there are times it comes close.<br /><br />Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this.<br /><br />From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him.<br /><br />The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.<br /><br />Minor spoilers herein.<br /><br />The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the end. It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.",1,de grot is a terrific dutch thriller  based on the book written by tim krabbé  another of his books  het gouden ei was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called spoorloos  the vanishing  in 1988  this one is not as good as that thriller  although much better than the american remake also called the vanishing  but there are times it comes close  especially the opening moments are terrific  we see a man  later we learn his name is egon wagter  fedja van huêt   coming from a plane in thailand  when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border  these scenes are perfectly directed  photographed and acted  a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this  later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman  both stating that they have never done anything like this  from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash forward  we see how egon  still as a child  here played by erik van der horst   befriends a guy named axel  as a kid played by benja bruijning   we learn how they grew up as friends  sort of  and how axel  as an adult played by marcel hensema  became a criminal  egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman  around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him  the movie is chronological in a way  it shows egon and axel as kids  than as students  young adults  and in their mid thirties  but from time to time  like i said  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again  every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults  minor spoilers herein  the title means the cave  and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending  although it is in fact not that happy  like the beginning  the ending is terrific  the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes  only to come back at that point in the end  it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well 
"Want to watch a scary horror film? Then steer clear of this one. There's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable.<br /><br />However, there is enough scotch. Single-malt, if you can manage it.<br /><br />If the previous comments weren't enough to keep you from watching this film sober, allow me to assist. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go downhill from there, and wackiness ensues.<br /><br />I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the film, and the book was dreadful. At least some pretense is made towards suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's (rhymes with 'gas').<br /><br />Not to say that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film, and Jonathan Demme found that he's really better suited to direct.<br /><br />Yes, there is an MST3K episode featuring this flick, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of scotch can save you.<br /><br />Please, just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can not, in all good conscience, recommend this film to the sober film-going public.",0,want to watch a scary horror film  then steer clear of this one  theres not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable  however  there is enough scotch  single malt  if you can manage it  if the previous comments werent enough to keep you from watching this film sober  allow me to assist  nasa sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit saturn  a really big solar flare causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose  things go downhill from there  and wackiness ensues  i actually read the book adaptation  which was published and released only in the uk  miles better than the film  and the book was dreadful  at least some pretense is made towards suspense  and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the authors  rhymes with gas   not to say that the film is completely without merit  rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film  and jonathan demme found that hes really better suited to direct  yes  there is an mst3k episode featuring this flick  but it is  of course  edited quite a bit  without the obligatory flashing of the breasts  not even the healing power of scotch can save you  please  just go watch raiders of the lost ark if you want to see a guy melt  see space cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts  i can not  in all good conscience  recommend this film to the sober film going public 
"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn-worthy. She's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous. The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine.<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a ""dumb chick."" I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says ""Watch my show or I'll kill my dog,"" is actually believable. I know she's a wanna be comedienne. She just comes across as a warped nut-case.

"There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and societal means. Not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality, and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject.<br /><br />The setting is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. Passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match.<br /><br />The women who were caught (Played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani, and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and, most likely, all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them, both city and villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules.<br /><br />It is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it's women from the crude behavior of it's men. Rather than educating the male population, they deny privilege and rights to the women.<br /><br />Seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of Iranian society, it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in Iran.

"Deranged and graphically gory Japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.<br /><br />Technically superb horror comedy(?) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but lets just say its pretty gruesome. If you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film. Personally I'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level. Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to people I know who like really gory movies.. Its also a film with enough going on in the details that I want to see it again since now that I know what was going on-as revealed in the end-I want to go back and see what it was I didn't catch on to. There is an internal logic rare in these films.<br /><br />7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs, its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else.",1,deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg zombie like machines  which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser  in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected  technically superb horror comedy    is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying  good taste prevents me from describing what happens here  but lets just say its pretty gruesome  if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film  personally im not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level  here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies   its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on as revealed in the end i want to go back and see what it was i didnt catch on to  there is an internal logic rare in these films  7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs  its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else 
"Kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).",1,kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film  mainly through cinematography  but also using an ingenious score  he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start  it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is  in my eyes  of course it doesnt hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances ive ever seen  a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad  duvall and lloyd are artificial  to be nice  but its easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant  plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time  scatman crothers  
"I saw this film and heard the writer-director, Juan Gerard, speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival.<br /><br />All I knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family.<br /><br />Its opening scene will bring to mind ""Cinema Paradiso"". In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), ""chicken clucking"" (Rebel Without a Cause), references to Bunuel, ""Touch of Evil""; you'll find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown)is a reference to Cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of Greek chorus.<br /><br />What this film really is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life.<br /><br />This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real,as are the events depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover) but his dream was to make this movie. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an ""angel"" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather ""Che"". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles.<br /><br />Truthfully, the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines, and some overracting, but stay with it. The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet, and honest climax. It is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through,in this sincere first effort. I would definitely see it again, and hope that he continues his film career.<br /><br />",1,i saw this film and heard the writer director  juan gerard  speak at the santa barbara intl film festival  all i knew about it was that it was the story of an 8 year old boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family  its opening scene will bring to mind  cinema paradiso   in fact  the film is filled with references to classic films  the roulette wheel  casablanca    chicken clucking   rebel without a cause   references to bunuel   touch of evil   youll find more  the homeless man  georg stanford brown is a reference to cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus  what this film really is is the culmination of a dream  gerards wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life  this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are real as are the events depicted  gerard is actually an architect and engineer  and passionate film lover  but his dream was to make this movie  he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an  angel  who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it  keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather  che   brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast  iben hjejle  high fidelity  and gael garcia bernal  y tu mama tambien  offer strong support in key roles  truthfully  the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines  and some overracting  but stay with it  the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet  and honest climax  it is the first effort of juan gerard  but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through in this sincere first effort  i would definitely see it again  and hope that he continues his film career

"One of Scorsese's worst. An average thriller; the only thing to recommend it is De Niro playing the psycho. The finale is typically of this genre i.e. over-the-top, with yet another almost invincible, immune-to-pain villain. I didn't like the 60s original, and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake. Then again, considering how bad his recent movies have been (I'm referring to his dull Buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress, the blond girl Di Caprio) this isn't even that bad by comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake... could have been far worse.",0,one of scorseses worst  an average thriller  the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho  the finale is typically of this genre i e  over the top  with yet another almost invincible  immune to pain villain  i didnt like the 60s original  and this version wasnt much of an improvement on it  i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake  then again  considering how bad his recent movies have been  im referring to his dull buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress  the blond girl di caprio  this isnt even that bad by comparison  and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake    could have been far worse 
"I'm a pretty old dude, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke as they were 50-55 years ago, when every taste for a kid was fresh. I wish I have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker, so that I could taste those things today. This magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how I've drifted, physically and otherwise, a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations. Over the half century, they would have had to adjust quite a bit, because you see I would have known that I set them aside. Eating one now would be a celebration of self and past, and story, and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward.<br /><br />I didn't have enough sense to do that with original Coke. And I couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I really tuned into Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know, movies smuggled out of the Soviet block. Movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward. Movies that make you want to live with Polish women, one, and then deciding that they would be the last to get it.<br /><br />Here's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and set it aside. I did not watch it. I deferred until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I would test myself, my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it. There probably are few Poles who have worked at this, practicing to deserve Chopin. Working to deserve womanness when I see it. Trying to get the inners from the edges.<br /><br />Recently, I achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out. I already knew that I was already past the time when this would work optimally, because I had already seen and understood ""9th Gate.""<br /><br />If you do not know this, it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant (about whom the story is named) jumped out the window, to die later after this man (played by Polanski) visits. What happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman. We are fooled into believing that he is merely mad. But the way we follow him, he is not. He merely has flashes that the world is normal, and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality.<br /><br />The story hardly matters. What matters is how Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years. Its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wig.<br /><br />I know of no one else that could do this, this sketch that remains a sketch, this horror that remains natural.<br /><br />To understand the genius of this, you have to know one of the greatest films ever made; ""Rear Window."" The genius of that film is the post-noir notion that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out. In Rear Window, the idea was that the on-screen viewer (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor and everything else was fiction, woven as we watched. Here, the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker.

"Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.<br /><br />As a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of PC mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. Talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. Regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. I had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how PC showed a world different than what they knew in reality.<br /><br />This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view.

"Brilliant! My wife and I joined the sprawling line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the film, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people. She is a young girl, he is a worn out westerner. The film grasped every bone in our body. There aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch - its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut. The film is beautifully shot. Among others, we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's rawness (cant believe this is her first acting job)and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a couple of days. Highly recommended.",1,brilliant  my wife and i joined the sprawling line to see holly at the edinburgh film festival  after seeing the film  i can understand why there was such a long line  holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people  she is a young girl  he is a worn out westerner  the film grasped every bone in our body  there arent any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch   its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut  the film is beautifully shot  among others  we loved the scene where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle  thuy ngoyens rawness  cant believe this is her first acting job and ron livingstons performance stayed with me for a couple of days  highly recommended 
"Make up your own mind. Personally I found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Maybe it is comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids; Wheeler(Seann William Scott)and Danny(Paul Rudd),two energy drink salesmen, to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny(Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie(Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is Augie(Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies.

"I was really horrified by this eerie movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start sweating, and feeling uncomfortable, for you start fearing the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare, and what's worse-it all comes out. For one hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake.

"I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. These I got. What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.<br /><br />If you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.<br /><br />I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.",1,i went into the straight story expecting a sad happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting  these i got  what i wasnt expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence  leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition  if you didnt notice  watch it again  paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets  the terrain hes driving through  the reactions people give him  the kinds of discussions he has  one of the first is about pregnancy and children  one of the last is outside of a cemetery   the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context  as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount  the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death  and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife  in which he achieves the desired reunion  i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention

"Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, Bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves. The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.",0,another violent  angry fantasy from paul verhoeven  verhoeven is a puzzle  its difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously  with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion  he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world  and this has some outstanding ones  cannot hide a negligence to story  dialogue and performance  kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy  bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side   the river wild  in an attempt to offset his boyish looks  given the material  however  bacon isnt nearly hateful enough to compel  the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin  neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who  when forced to deliver inane dialogue  embarrass themselves  the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended 
"A couple of years back I had purchased (and enjoyed) the MGM double-feature DVD of the two Kolchak TV movies, THE NIGHT STALKER (1971) and THE NIGHT STRANGLER (1972). When the Universal set of the subsequent TV series came out, I had intended to buy it immediately – but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded DVD-18s kept me from adding it to my collection; recently, I placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted Universal Box Sets and decided to pick up the KOLCHAK 3-Discer as well.<br /><br />Having watched it now, I can safely say that I didn’t regret acquiring this beloved (if short-lived) crime/horror series one bit: it may follow a standardized formula – dogged and resourceful newspaperman Carl Kolchak, marvelously played by Darren McGavin, gets into everybody’s hair with his attitude (flustered editor Simon Oakland, long-suffering colleagues, assorted authoritarian figures, a plethora of monsters and villains), faces up to the inevitable (and usually supernatural) threat alone but, finally, is pressured into keeping his story under wraps – but a winning one (further boosted by an impressive line-up of guest stars and notable behind-the-scenes credits), making the show a great deal of fun.<br /><br />That said, quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make-up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired (for instance, the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment) – not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50-minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes (in the case of the werewolf, again, he’s never seen biting anyone but, somewhat foolishly, is made to merely throw people around)! <br /><br />While the hero’s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots, there’s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, revolving around McGavin’s relationship with either Oakland or geeky reporter Jack Grinnage) – to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere (the setting, for the most part, is Chicago) and suspense. To make the ride even more pleasant, there’s a bouncy score by Gil Melle' and Jerry Fielding.<br /><br />For the record, the monsters encountered (but not always defeated) by Kolchak throughout the series are: a revived Jack The Ripper, a variety of cults (voodoo, Native American, Aztec), aliens, vampire, werewolf (going round its over-familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise-liner!), doppelganger, Satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcyclist, succubus, a knight’s armor taking a murderous life of its own (the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast – featuring John Dehner as a morose police captain, Hans Conried and Robert Emhardt), Helen Of Troy(!) and crocodile. Some of the actors (other than those playing Kolchak’s co-workers) return in the same roles – Keenan Wynn and Ramon Bieri (both as officers of the law), John Fiedler (as a shrewd morgue attendant) and Richard Kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero. If I were pressed to choose the finest (or most entertaining) episodes, I’d lean towards HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS (co-starring Phil Silvers and Abraham Sofaer) and the afore-mentioned THE KNIGHTLY MURDERS – while, as the weakest, I’d go for THE WEREWOLF (due to reasons I’ve already explained) and CHOPPER (based on a story concocted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale!).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the set contains no extras: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER, as well as putting the series into the context of where TV was at the time of its original airing, or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci-fi series popular today. In fact, Kolchak himself – in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise – returned in a 2005 revival; this version is available at my local DVD rental outlet…but, for various reasons, I’m not sure I’d want to check it out so soon after the 1974-5 classic!",1,a couple of years back i had purchased  and enjoyed  the mgm double feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies  the night stalker  1971  and the night strangler  1972   when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out  i had intended to buy it immediately – but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd 18s kept me from adding it to my collection  recently  i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak 3 discer as well  having watched it now  i can safely say that i didn’t regret acquiring this beloved  if short lived  crime horror series one bit  it may follow a standardized formula – dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak  marvelously played by darren mcgavin  gets into everybody’s hair with his attitude  flustered editor simon oakland  long suffering colleagues  assorted authoritarian figures  a plethora of monsters and villains   faces up to the inevitable  and usually supernatural  threat alone but  finally  is pressured into keeping his story under wraps – but a winning one  further boosted by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits   making the show a great deal of fun  that said  quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired  for instance  the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment  – not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50 minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes  in the case of the werewolf  again  he’s never seen biting anyone but  somewhat foolishly  is made to merely throw people around    while the hero’s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots  there’s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode  often  but not exclusively  revolving around mcgavin’s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage  – to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere  the setting  for the most part  is chicago  and suspense  to make the ride even more pleasant  there’s a bouncy score by gil melle and jerry fielding  for the record  the monsters encountered  but not always defeated  by kolchak throughout the series are  a revived jack the ripper  a variety of cults  voodoo  native american  aztec   aliens  vampire  werewolf  going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner    doppelganger  satanist  swamp creature  mass of electricity  robot  apeman  witch  headless motorcyclist  succubus  a knight’s armor taking a murderous life of its own  the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast – featuring john dehner as a morose police captain  hans conried and robert emhardt   helen of troy    and crocodile  some of the actors  other than those playing kolchak’s co workers  return in the same roles – keenan wynn and ramon bieri  both as officers of the law   john fiedler  as a shrewd morgue attendant  and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero  if i were pressed to choose the finest  or most entertaining  episodes  i’d lean towards horror in the heights  co starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer  and the afore mentioned the knightly murders – while  as the weakest  i’d go for the werewolf  due to reasons i’ve already explained  and chopper  based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale    unfortunately  the set contains no extras  it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak  the night stalker  as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing  or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today  in fact  kolchak himself – in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise – returned in a 2005 revival  this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet…but  for various reasons  i’m not sure i’d want to check it out so soon after the 1974 5 classic 
"I had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 Moving Picture Festival In Birmingham, Alabama. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it a second time when they had an encore screening.<br /><br />When I think of the films that are shown at festivals, I usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat, often with the feel of an elaborate student project. There's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course, and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film-making. By ""mainstream,"" I mean more like a film produced for national release - In other words, a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater.<br /><br />The writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro. There is nothing typically independent about this film. As an aspiring director, I am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going. This is one of those films. As I watched The Big Bad Swim, my motivation level was incredible. I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. The reason I felt this way was because I was so impressed with every aspect of this production. I left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put-off project. When a movie makes me feel like that, I know it's really good. This is the first feature-length project from Ishai Setton and I found myself wishing that It had been my project. For me, that's really rare.<br /><br />See this film. It's beautifully shot and directed, and the casting is excellent. Paget Brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance. She has a quality about her, a charisma, that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen. She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. That's a gift. I think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often. Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler also did top-notch jobs. I can not say enough nice things about The Big Bad Swim.

"I didn't know the real events when I sat down to watch this, just the fact that this was based upon a true story. After the death of the kid's father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree(... I did not know anyone actually named their offspring that) cope with the loss. This is really made for children, as is often the case with ""family"" flicks(with that said, go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing, though I'd keep teenagers out of it, unless you're sure they're gonna buy the concept), but it doesn't downplay the sting that the death of a parent is, and it doesn't really talk down to anyone. The plot is sufficiently interesting, and moves along well enough. Acting varies, with the excellent Burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast, Mathis following that pretty well, and Ferland and her peers(with a few exceptions) being the least convincing of the bunch(and frankly, they're irritating; then again, I'm not really in the intended audience for this thing). The editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so, the tone is not an unpleasant one. There is an intense scene or two in this.

"Back in 1985 I caught this thing (I can't even call it a movie) on cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control. I figured out early on that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while--but even he was bored after 30 minutes in. Remember--this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY! This was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the Internet and such. We kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened. The funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap! (One poster had a fictional review that said, ""This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!""). Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business. No-budget and boring t&a.

"Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie.

Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. This is then compounded with, ............................yes I'll say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching ""Coffee Talk"" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth.

"I love these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. It is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does. How they ever got these kids to ""act"" I'll never know. I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a totally different mind set.",1,i love these  diaper baby  movies  you couldnt make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history  it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh  which it does  how they ever got these kids to  act  ill never know  i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30s  you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young  the stock market had crashed  the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world  the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension  but then dinner for 25 cents is too  it was a different time with a totally different mind set 
"The star of this film is the screenplay. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language ,social mores ( we don't hurt women) and the politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo to-day. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received. It is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step. A great film....",1,the star of this film is the screenplay  attention to detail for the period in dress  language  social mores   we dont hurt women  and the politics are remarkable  it is a reminder of kosovo to day  the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb  perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received  it is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step  a great film    
"Polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, in The Tenant.<br /><br />The atmosphere is trademark Polanski - dark, brooding, unnerving - but there is something awkward about this movie and I am not sure whether or not it is deliberate.<br /><br />Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, doesn't quite do himself justice here. As his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie, I was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film.<br /><br />The only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting cast are great, notably Melvyn Douglas as the landlord and Shelley Winters as the concierge, but others are weak and miscast. It is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents.<br /><br />Quite unexpectedly, there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. However, there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows, which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey.<br /><br />All in all, The Tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience, if a little too languorous for its own good. There's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film, while being very good, does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have.<br /><br />Alas, at the end of the day, an 'okay' Polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth a watch, just don't expect to be blown away.",1,polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in repulsion and rosemarys baby  in the tenant  the atmosphere is trademark polanski   dark  brooding  unnerving   but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate  sven nykvist  who was responsible for some of bergmans most beautiful films  doesnt quite do himself justice here  as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie  i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film  the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting  polanski is certainly not a bad actor  but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of trelkovsky  some of the supporting cast are great  notably melvyn douglas as the landlord and shelley winters as the concierge  but others are weak and miscast  it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed parisians have american accents  quite unexpectedly  there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film  anyone who has seen the fearless vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor  however  there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself  trelkovskys sudden  and somewhat unexplained  transformation is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows  which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho dramatic journey  all in all  the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience  if a little too languorous for its own good  theres a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film  while being very good  does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have  alas  at the end of the day  an okay polanski movie is still better than most other good movies  definitely worth a watch  just dont expect to be blown away 
"OK I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin is not, never has been, and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies America has ever produced. How anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me. To compound things the exercise was repeated in Martin's unfunny attempt to be Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career. Some of your contributers say 'Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character', to that I would say 'balderdash' , his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be treasured for generations to come",0,ok im not an american  but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not  never has been  and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction  phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man  no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced  how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me  to compound things the exercise was repeated in martins unfunny attempt to be peter sellers inspector clouseau  another abortive attempt  in my opinion  to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career  some of your contributers say steve martin puts his own stamp on the character  to that i would say balderdash   his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come
"This flick reminded me of those lame ""erotic thrillers"" I used to stay up late and watch on Cinemax when I was 13. I'd label this flick softer-core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder. There is, however, a ton of nudity- the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodder's keester (or at least a stunt butt) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the Munster's for a costume. 13 year old boys rejoice.<br /><br />Other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in years. The shots look like FMV's from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way, way too many times.<br /><br />The plot and acting make no sense. There is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid-werewolves- the Darkwolf is the latter but from what I can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do- look human, change to a wolf an kill people. The Darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can't find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches. Once more, this skills proves less than useful since the Darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched, met or even saw as best I can tell. The mate doesn't know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something.<br /><br />You'd think it'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but, well they did.

"This film is a huge steaming pile. <br /><br />I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland/Mason version needed to be redone, nor why Striesand would have been a first choice to star.<br /><br />For that matter, I have no idea why our people (Gay Americans) tend largely to regard Striesand as some kind of treasure.

"I thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi).<br /><br />Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. The passion to which Artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.<br /><br />Although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time.<br /><br />Overall i thought this film was fantastic.",1,i thought this movie was stunning  with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi  artemisia gentileschi   cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully  with tentative yet confidant mannerisms  her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place  the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch  although not each character was overtly beautiful  this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time  overall i thought this film was fantastic 
"First off, I didn't know what to expect when I started the video.<br /><br />Anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present, something gets inexplicably lost in the translation.<br /><br />That's not the case here.

"The story of peace-loving farmers and townspeople fighting for land, water, law and order, and the respect and ultimate subjugation of the long entrenched cattle interests and their hired guns had been worked over better in earlier (Shane) and probably later films as well. There's some good action scenes and the general layout of the story, excluding a disappointing ending, is well executed. Law and order and religion have established roots in the town, but the old order of cattle drives, cowboys, and gunslingers is still around as well. The clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged ambush scene where the townsmen ride right into a trap. Granger, an ex-gunfighter, plays the guy who is shunned by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun.",1,the story of peace loving farmers and townspeople fighting for land  water  law and order  and the respect and ultimate subjugation of the long entrenched cattle interests and their hired guns had been worked over better in earlier  shane  and probably later films as well  theres some good action scenes and the general layout of the story  excluding a disappointing ending  is well executed  law and order and religion have established roots in the town  but the old order of cattle drives  cowboys  and gunslingers is still around as well  the clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged ambush scene where the townsmen ride right into a trap  granger  an ex gunfighter  plays the guy who is shunned by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun

"This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes, with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. There's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There's a boatload of talent here. I realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun, and kind of sweet.",1,this movie is a lot of fun  what makes it great especially are two things  one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes  with discussions of their costumes and superpowers  theres an endearing earnestness to the parody thats very appealing  the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry  claire forlani deserves particular note as the object of mr  furiouss desires  theres a boatload of talent here  i realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed  but this movie is a lot of fun  and kind of sweet

"Don't mistake ""War Inc."" for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. It isn't.<br /><br />This is an old-fashioned screwball comedy, with ridiculously coincidental plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content.<br /><br />You see, the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true. Yeah, we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons, and American imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now -- but none of that is the point.<br /><br />Here, all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon -- sometimes in genius ways -- as the backdrop for a silly romp, as John Cusack's character (the hit-man with a heart) tries to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesn't trust him (Tomei) and the young Middle Eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss.<br /><br />That's all, and it works. It's simple fun, but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the Middle East wish our Western culture would supplant theirs, then you might not find it as funny.<br /><br />For all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.",1,dont mistake  war inc   for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs  it isnt  this is an old fashioned screwball comedy  with ridiculously coincidental plot twists  stock characters  given some depth in fun performances by john cusack  joan cusack  marisa tomei and hillary duff  and a straightforward approach to the political content  you see  the filmmakers political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true  yeah  we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt  inept pigs  the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons  and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now    but none of that is the point  here  all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon    sometimes in genius ways    as the backdrop for a silly romp  as john cusacks character  the hit man with a heart  tries to change his life with the help of the do gooder journalist who doesnt trust him  tomei  and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage  duff   cusacks sister  joan  plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality  ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss  thats all  and it works  its simple fun  but if somehow you cant see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and theres no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs  then you might not find it as funny  for all the rest of us  it was a light comedy with a political edge 
"What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly ""must see"" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to ""fine-tune"" the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.<br /><br />The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never gets): If it works, don't screw with it!<br /><br />azjazz",0,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe  during the first season  dark angel was on my weekly  must see  list  and not just because of jessica alba  unfortunately  the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to  fine tune  the plotline  within 3 episodes of the season opener  they had totally lost me as a viewer  not even to see jessica alba    i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish  the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin  on one of the second season episodes  they even had max sleeping and dreaming   where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleep  the moral of the story  the one that hollywood never gets   if it works  dont screw with it  azjazz
"This movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, great music, and excellent visuals without significant special effects. It is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. That's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: ""1984"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey (compare its space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimov's ""I Robot"" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's).",1,this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast  a gripping story with a chilling ending  great music  and excellent visuals without significant special effects  it is interesting to note though that  like so much science fiction  its predictions for the future dont appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted  thats not to say were out of the woods yet  but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition  it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics   1984    2001  a space odyssey  compare its space station with our international space station  and isaac asimovs  i robot   positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990s

"Just saw the movie this past weekend, I am upset, and disappointed with it. Basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, the ones from former Soviet Union especially, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what Americans have been working for. Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs. The actors did pretty well, but it wasn't up to them save this bunch of crap. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy.

"I really love the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them. They found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act (Remember ""Candy""?). The reason I was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. The story here has a European sci-fi film called ""Dragonfly"" being made and the director is fired. So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) to complete the picture. They're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays Dragonfly but she's barely in it. Film is written and directed by Roman Coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script. I wish the film could have been an homage to those early films. They could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. There is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell appear as well. I guess I'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties.

"Road to Perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.<br /><br />It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece.

"""The Straight Story"" is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged, dying brother. But that's just the basic synapsis...this movie is about so much more than that. This was Richard's Farnworth's last role before he died, and it's definitely one that he will be remembered for. He's a stubborn old man, not unlike a lot of the old men that you and I probably know. <br /><br />""The Straight Story"" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives.

"The Great Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I dare to say that he performs some songs better than Caruso (check A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). The MGM art and music departments also did a good job. This movie could be perfect, were it not for the awkward presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she is trying her best, dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better leading lady, and Blyth should stick to less demanding productions. Also notice that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano.",1,the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza  he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer  paired with dorothy kirsten  soprano of the metropolitan opera  indeed  i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso  check avuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini   the mgm art and music departments also did a good job  this movie could be perfect  were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth  we see that she is trying her best  dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920   unforgivable  lanza deserved a better leading lady  and blyth should stick to less demanding productions  also notice that ms  kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza  giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano

"foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail squarely on the head. Make sure you read it. In case you don't, a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest, to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family doesn't take kindly to this, and proceeds to pick off the team one by one, largely offscreen. Big Foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face, but is less scary overall than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movie has the wooden, generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away. This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on screen. We do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches, but nothing comes of this.",0,foywonders review of this cheap stv hits the nail squarely on the head  make sure you read it  in case you dont  a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the pacific northwest  to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard  the big foot family doesnt take kindly to this  and proceeds to pick off the team one by one  largely offscreen  big foot himself has a distinctly ape like face  but is less scary overall than harry from harry and the hendersons  most of the movie has the wooden  generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away  this is a no budget movie in which very little happens  at least on screen  we do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches  but nothing comes of this 
"This is a very old and cheaply made film--a typical low-budget B-Western in so many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of John Wayne that were done for ""poverty row"" studios. With both actors, their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper doesn't seem exactly like the Cooper of just a few years later (he talks faster in this early film, among other things).<br /><br />However, unlike the average B-movie of the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you ever want to see the woman that was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very, very odd casting choice, as she has a heavy accent (she was French) and wasn't even close to being ""movie star pretty"". Incidentally, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /><br />But for me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot--sort of like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought this was a NEW idea). Gary Cooper's character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep Cooper clear of females. This misogyny alone doesn't necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls--with his arms cradled around him! This was pretty edgy stuff for the time and I think this makes this dull film really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip-able. Unless you are curious about Damita or the homosexual undertones, do yourself a favor and find a better Western.",0,this is a very old and cheaply made film  a typical low budget b western in so many ways  gary cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of john wayne that were done for  poverty row  studios  with both actors  their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed  this incarnation of gary cooper doesnt seem exactly like the cooper of just a few years later  he talks faster in this early film  among other things   however  unlike the average b movie of the era  there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique  if not good   if you ever want to see the woman that was married to errol flynn for seven years  this is your chance  lili damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very  very odd casting choice  as she has a heavy accent  she was french  and wasnt even close to being  movie star pretty   incidentally  she was also married to director michael curtiz   but for me  the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot  sort of like a brokeback mountain from the 1930s  and we thought this was a new idea   gary coopers character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep cooper clear of females  this misogyny alone doesnt necessarily mean much  but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple  in particular  towards the end  when one of them is killed  the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls  with his arms cradled around him  this was pretty edgy stuff for the time and i think this makes this dull film really fascinating today  as far as cooper and the plot go  the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip able  unless you are curious about damita or the homosexual undertones  do yourself a favor and find a better western

"Eric Rohmer's 'The Lady and the Duke' is based on the journals of an English aristocrat who lived through the French revolution. But it's a stilted affair, with its strange, painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone. Most notably, this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie, and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted, but spoilt, aristocratic classes. The result is frequently dull, and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director.",0,eric rohmers the lady and the duke is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution  but its a stilted affair  with its strange  painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone  most notably  this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action  one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie  and little of the chaos  poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted  but spoilt  aristocratic classes  the result is frequently dull  and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction  its a disappointing film from an acclaimed director 
"Return To The 3th Chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin, in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter. In this sequel Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten. He imitates the original Shan Te, tries all manner of tricks to get into Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses. Its a classic light hearted martial arts tale, with the ace production values of the Shaw Brothers and the sure footed direction of Lui Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic throughout, whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and Gordon Liu's performance, as are the others, particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material. The film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander, more violent and sweeping Shaw Brothers films. But few have such a magical blend of slapstick, unique training and fighting, with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good. Full of light hearted joy, its impossible not to give this the highest score.",1,return to the 3th chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th chamber of shaolin  in which gordon liu played shan te  a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter  in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten  he imitates the original shan te  tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses  its a classic light hearted martial arts tale  with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang  the choreography is fantastic throughout  whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon lius performance  as are the others  particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material  the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander  more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films  but few have such a magical blend of slapstick  unique training and fighting  with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good  full of light hearted joy  its impossible not to give this the highest score 
"There's not much to say about this one. Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. He is loosed by a nuclear explosion. He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. Safe. From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space. As usual, the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans), uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does no good. They should know this anyway. We've seen a lot of monsters stomp on Tokyo.

"Dog Bite Dog isn't going to be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but don't worry  the lead's a terrible shot), it can best be described as a violent romp through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister. Despite being filthy from his journey, he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this sounds wildly implausible to you, you should probably avoid this film. It acted as my cue to suspend disbelief, and I had a lot more fun for it.<br /><br />Chasing Pang down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai walks a fine line that has Internal Affairs investigating him, and his father, a legendary Good Cop, is in a coma following a drug deal that went south (the implication is that Wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings).<br /><br />There are a car crashes, lots of killings, and a strange and awkward love story on offer here, all played out in almost comic-book style. I suspect the humour was deliberate (nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd), though the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members. There are at least three points where the film might have ended, and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing, or the deletion of one of the narrative threads (the light-hearted stuff worked well, so I would have left out the interactions with the three fathers).<br /><br />I'm inclined to give it a (high) pass, however, if only because of the ending  I've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment.

"....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Barely even reaching feature length, ""Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses"" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy!

"The first few minutes of ""The Bodyguard"" do have a campy charm: it opens with crawling text from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson recites to his soon-to-be victims in ""Pulp Fiction""), continues with two karate school teachers in New York arguing about the eternal question of mankind (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears, playing himself; he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or unintentional, soon gets crushed by the disjointed story, the lack of action for long periods of time, and the poor quality of any present action. To keep it simple, here's why ""The Bodyguard"" is an unbearable movie to watch:<br /><br />1) You don't know what's going on. <br /><br />2) There are barely any fights. <br /><br />3) The fights that are there, are short and terribly filmed.<br /><br />Sonny Chiba is cool.

"I'm not sure quite why I clicked ""contains spoiler"", because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it.<br /><br />Visually it mostly delivers. Well, apart from some 80's throwback rubber-mask monsters. I'll say now that before watching this I had never seen the band Lordi, nor knew anything about them bar that they won Eurovision. Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band, pretty much in their stage personas. Whatever. Anyway, I didn't know this while watching. I just thought the monsters/demons were mostly passable. Just about.<br /><br />I'm almost sure there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on-screen, but it may actually be better not to know it. It probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it. The action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained, even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly.<br /><br />I gave it a four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it, especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing. Must have been the mood I was in, but I found that hella funny for some reason. Then I look up the movie on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it's supposed to be about. That amused me further, and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10.<br /><br />It's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's pretty nice visually and sonically. Overall, far from essential, but watchable. Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood.",0,im not sure quite why i clicked  contains spoiler   because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it  visually it mostly delivers  well  apart from some 80s throwback rubber mask monsters  ill say now that before watching this i had never seen the band lordi  nor knew anything about them bar that they won eurovision  apparently the monsters in this are members of the band  pretty much in their stage personas  whatever  anyway  i didnt know this while watching  i just thought the monsters demons were mostly passable  just about  im almost sure there is a semi coherent explanation behind what we see on screen  but it may actually be better not to know it  it probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it  the action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained  even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly  i gave it a four mainly because i got a good laugh out of it  especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing  must have been the mood i was in  but i found that hella funny for some reason  then i look up the movie on the internet and find out that nobody knows what the hell its supposed to be about  that amused me further  and raised my score an extra half point to a 4 10  its not scary  or particularly coherent  but its pretty nice visually and sonically  overall  far from essential  but watchable  dont expect too much and dont expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood 
"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the ""Oddities"" program, after ""The Head"" and before ""Aeon Flux"" if I recall correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.<br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on. And then there's the other weird creatures...<br /><br />I use ""or"" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe they're all real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist. Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others. You'll have to wait and find out.<br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive. And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story... guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced. This was the best show to appear on ""Oddities"", hands down.<br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out. It's ""Donnie Darko"" before there was ever such a thing.<br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment. By keeping it simple, they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures.",1,the internet database lists this as a tv show  and yes  it was a series on mtv shown on the  oddities  program  after  the head  and before  aeon flux  if i recall correctly  but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes  you have the story of the maxx  julie winters  sarah and mr  gone  the maxx is a super hero or a bum  julie a social worker or a leopard queen  sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr  gone a guy who cant seem to keep his head on  and then theres the other weird creatures    i use  or  with maxx and julie  because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams  maybe theyre all real or dreams  maybe one of the characters doesnt exist  maybe only one exists and dreams of the others  youll have to wait and find out  i had the comic books before the show came out  and it was one of my favorites  the artwork was spectacular and the story was original    unlike anything youll find in superman or batman  it will bend your mind  and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive  and the show used basically the same exact artwork  only now it moves  and the same story    guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced  this was the best show to appear on  oddities   hands down  if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip  this is a show to check out  its  donnie darko  before there was ever such a thing  the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series  but i dont say this in disappointment  by keeping it simple  they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures 
"You believe in God or you don't. You believe in Jesus or you don't. You believe He is the Son of God or you don't. The choice is up to you.<br /><br />Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring back Jesus to a mere historic figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary, Who opened Heaven again for us. Encouraging the Big Bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian bringing some ""modern findings"" to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, who happily incorporates them in his play.<br /><br />The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. More often than not the director's abhorrence of the Church is clearly visible.<br /><br />The director has tried to make a parallel between Jesus' life and the Passion Play actor's life. This is an admirable attempt, but depicting the Resurrection with the transplantation of the Passion Play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about Jesus.<br /><br />My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before Jesus' throne.",0,you believe in god or you dont  you believe in jesus or you dont  you believe he is the son of god or you dont  the choice is up to you  director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure  social worker  son of two humans  instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary  who opened heaven again for us  encouraging the big bang  a world come from evolution  instead of seeing the beauty of creation  the film depicts a theologian bringing some  modern findings  to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play  who happily incorporates them in his play  the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy  more often than not the directors abhorrence of the church is clearly visible  the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus life and the passion play actors life  this is an admirable attempt  but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actors organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus  my opinion is not important  gods opinion is  but i wouldnt want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus throne 
"The Incredible Melting Man plays like an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this film is a bit crummy but I found it impossible not to kind of like it.<br /><br />The acting and script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of $50 - the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does it's reasonably impressive; we also have one inventive death scene involving electrocution. Of note too is the music, it's insane - a cheese-tastic medley of nonsense.<br /><br />Notable highlights: <br /><br />* Marvel at the slow-motion nurse who jumps through a pane of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />* Be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head.<br /><br />* Beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid. Called Steve.<br /><br />* Be astonished when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen.<br /><br />This film is just too 70's for me to hate it. It's tacky and trashy but I thought it was a lot of fun.

"This movie stinks! You will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it. Sliding Doors, w/ Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda tries to do much much MUCH better. That movie was clever, witty, and well-acted. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths -- or rather the characters she played -- and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic.<br /><br />Where as Melinda & Melinda is tiresome, the dialogue is contrived and I could have cared less about any of these people -- least of all Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional -- her first glass of wine is at 10 a.m. -- and so melodramatic she is laughable, and not in the comedic sense. The 2nd Melinda is fine, but forgettable.<br /><br />Woody Allen's previous ensemble movies worked because, I'm guessing, he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months: you can tell. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented -- those around her are not, not enough to be a whole presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can't quite remember which ones.<br /><br />Sad, very sad.",0,this movie stinks  you will want back the two plus hours it takes to get through it  sliding doors  w  gwyenth paltrow and directed by peter howit  did what melinda   melinda tries to do much much much better  that movie was clever  witty  and well acted  i cared about what happened to both gwyenths    or rather the characters she played    and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic  where as melinda   melinda is tiresome  the dialogue is contrived and i could have cared less about any of these people    least of all melinda  one melinda is so dysfunctional    her first glass of wine is at 10 a m     and so melodramatic she is laughable  and not in the comedic sense  the 2nd melinda is fine  but forgettable  woody allens previous ensemble movies worked because  im guessing  he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented  one piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months  you can tell  and while chloe sevigny is talented    those around her are not  not enough to be a whole presence  the movie ends up being chloe sevigny and a bunch of other people you know youve seen in other movies but cant quite remember which ones  sad  very sad 
"SERIES THREE- BLACKADDER THE THIRD "" If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before you start"" Hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the Prince Regent, a vain and stupid foil for Blackadders venom, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw. The format is similar to the previous show, after all now they had found the winning formula why change things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick an M.P.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically, the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a stellar cast",1,series three  blackadder the third   if you want something done properly  kill baldrick before you start  hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince regent  a vain and stupid foil for blackadders venom  played by hugh laurie  baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw  the format is similar to the previous show  after all now they had found the winning formula why change things  we see blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways  trying to make bladrick an m p or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince  in many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically  the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times  samuel johnson  william pit and wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes  not an easy thing with such a stellar cast

"Amazing. That's what you'd say if you sat through this film. Simply, incredibly, amazing. It's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing. That, my friends, is what is truly scary about this film. Somebody thought it was a good idea to make it. <br /><br />Well, here's another amazingly original story: High School student (occasionally seemed like collegego figure) has whore for a mom, lives in a trailer park, and is an ""artist"" who is ridiculed for his ""being all different."" Well, of course, this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and, here's the original part, his soul inhabits a scarecrow (beneath which, he is killed by his slutty mama's latest john). Then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him. Awww.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />--Amazingly funny movieeven if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted.<br /><br />--This and the sequel on one disk in the Wal-Mart $5.00 binso it's only a little overpriced.<br /><br />Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br /><br />--The violence and gore are kind of sub-standard. One person is stabbed with a corncob.<br /><br />--Sounds like they put some effort into the musicbut it doesn't really fit the movieand isn't all that good.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />--Terrible, terrible acting.<br /><br />--Another slasher let-down with sexy womennone of them removing clothing. When did that cease being a staple of low-brow slashers??<br /><br />--Ridiculous story.<br /><br />--The scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush.<br /><br />--Standard underlying love story goes nowhere, and is poorly done.<br /><br />--Some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomyou never really know who anybody is and then they're killed. And you only assume that they must've had it coming.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />--Extremely average slasher fare, just with a murdering scarecrow instead of well, all that other crap.<br /><br />--Nowhere near as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or even Angela from the ""Sleepaway Camp"" seriesall of which are better than this atrocity.<br /><br />--The absolute worst dialogue I have ever heard in my LIFE. The script is laden with a level of retardedness that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious hereit's a full step beyond terrible. Don't get me wrong, though, it's funny as hellbut I've never heard more asinine bantereven in ""Slumber Party Massacre III."" This film makes ""Jason X"" look like Shakespeare.<br /><br />--The man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow: Worst wig ever. Dialogue to match.<br /><br />Memorable Scene:<br /><br />--The one where elementary-school youths spew out their own witty dialogue: ""Hey, let's go find small animals to torture. Huh huh.""<br /><br />Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 5/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 1/10 (No nudity, Mom's a whore, girls wear no bras) Violence/Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, mediocre amount) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, blatant, over-the-top and painfully funnyso bad it's good.

"Spider-Man is in my opinion the best superhero ever, and this game is the best superhero game ever. While it may be somewhat easy, you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers, which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game. It may seem hard to control at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will be web-slinging like Spider-Man himself.<br /><br />The bosses, while like the levels are somewhat easy, are fun. The first boss, Scorpion, is incredibly easy to beat, which shouldn't be so because as fans of the comic books know, Scorpion is one of Spider-Man's most deadly villains. The second boss, Rhino, is also very easy. The 3rd boss is Venom, who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game, which definately shouldn't be. The 4th boss is Venom again. This time, he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy. The 5th boss is Mysterio, who I think is the funnest boss to battle in the game. He is also one of the harder bosses, but once again, still fairly easy. Next boss is Carnage, who is, you guessed it, easy to beat. But Carnage is actually kind of fun to fight. 7th boss is Doctor Octopus, who is like all the other bosses easy, but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield. The 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in a comic book or cartoon. I won't spoil it for you for those of you who haven't played the game, but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn't too easy. Took me 4 or 5 tries to beat while the others I beat on the first or second tries.<br /><br />All in all, a very good game. I gave it an 8 out of 10. The reasons why I didn't give it a 9 or 10 are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring (getting all that stuff will take a while though), it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show, the bosses are too easy, and they should have used Hobgoblin and/or Green Goblin as a boss, I think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air! They didn't use them in the sequel to this game either! Well the Green Goblin is the villain in the upcoming Spider-Man movie, so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie.",1,spider man is in my opinion the best superhero ever  and this game is the best superhero game ever  while it may be somewhat easy  you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers  which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game  it may seem hard to control at first  but once you get the hang of it  you will be web slinging like spider man himself  the bosses  while like the levels are somewhat easy  are fun  the first boss  scorpion  is incredibly easy to beat  which shouldnt be so because as fans of the comic books know  scorpion is one of spider mans most deadly villains  the second boss  rhino  is also very easy  the 3rd boss is venom  who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game  which definately shouldnt be  the 4th boss is venom again  this time  he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy  the 5th boss is mysterio  who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game  he is also one of the harder bosses  but once again  still fairly easy  next boss is carnage  who is  you guessed it  easy to beat  but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight  7th boss is doctor octopus  who is like all the other bosses easy  but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield  the 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game  never in a comic book or cartoon  i wont spoil it for you for those of you who havent played the game  but the boss is the only boss in the game that isnt too easy  took me 4 or 5 tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries  all in all  a very good game  i gave it an 8 out of 10  the reasons why i didnt give it a 9 or 10 are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring  getting all that stuff will take a while though   it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show  the bosses are too easy  and they should have used hobgoblin and or green goblin as a boss  i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air  they didnt use them in the sequel to this game either  well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider man movie  so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie 
"Okay, I've watched this movie twice now, I have researched it heavily on the net, I have asked several people on there opinions. I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book that this movie is supposed to be based on. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it. As the plot of the movie doesn't seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book.<br /><br />Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father, Mr De Lafontaine. They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they get a letter from the 'General' a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death. He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what has she to do with Laura's condition, and the General?<br /><br />I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name, and would have a jingle too, but I can't be bothered with that. It's called the ""this movie doesn't make any sense"" game.<br /><br />All you have to do is, whilst watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening. I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete.<br /><br />It will have to answer such questions as ... <br /><br />* Why can vampires walk around in day light?<br /><br />* Why are they all lesbians?<br /><br />* Why is a girl called Bob? and why does she shoot herself?<br /><br />* When is the movie a dream and when is it real?<br /><br />* Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn't make anyone bat an eyelid?<br /><br />* Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car, yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too?<br /><br />* And why does he then let a girl, which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire, drive with him in his car?<br /><br />* And then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car?<br /><br />What the hell is the asylum scene all about?<br /><br />* What the hell is the green goo all about?<br /><br />* Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse?<br /><br />* Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies?<br /><br />* What is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know that?<br /><br />In fact sod it, it's just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too.<br /><br />I have my plot, and I have to admit it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort.<br /><br />In Conclusion<br /><br />'Vampires vs Zombies' has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?",0,okay  ive watched this movie twice now  i have researched it heavily on the net  i have asked several people on there opinions  i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic carmilla  a book that this movie is supposed to be based on  i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it  as the plot of the movie doesnt seem to make any sense at all  here is the plot of the book  laura lives in a castle in syberia with her father  mr de lafontaine  they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully  one day they get a letter from the general a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death  he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work  and explains that he will visit them soon  meanwhile  a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter  carmilla  for several months  soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams  and begins to come down with a strange illness  who is this mysterious carmilla  and just what has she to do with lauras condition  and the general  i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it  and let me know what their results are  i even have a catchy name  and would have a jingle too  but i cant be bothered with that  its called the  this movie doesnt make any sense  game  all you have to do is  whilst watching the movie  try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening  i mean complete  all questions answered  everything makes sense  absolutely complete  it will have to answer such questions as        why can vampires walk around in day light    why are they all lesbians    why is a girl called bob  and why does she shoot herself    when is the movie a dream and when is it real    why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesnt make anyone bat an eyelid    why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car  yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car  accept the excuse that she is a zombie too    and why does he then let a girl  which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire  drive with him in his car    and then let her drive off  alone with his daughter in a stolen car  what the hell is the asylum scene all about    what the hell is the green goo all about    why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse    why are there never any vampires fighting zombies    what is the significance of the necklace  what is it made of  why does it kill vampires  and how does jenna know that  in fact sod it  its just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too  i have my plot  and i have to admit it is not quite there  but it is a pretty good effort  in conclusion vampires vs zombies has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies  everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on  yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this  and somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel  how  why  what the hell is going on

"Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, leaden and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. Despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed.",0,wow  this film is truly awful  i cant imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight  the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast  the story is disjointed  fragmented and incoherent  the telling  leaden and predictable  no wit  no charm  no humour  not sexy in the least  the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake  theres also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on  when your lead  carrell  is unfunny and unappealing its uphill from there  despite its phony turn around ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach  if this is what passes for humour and social comment then were definitely doomed 
"Saving Grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors. There's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user. It's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by English slapstick, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable.",1,saving grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place  grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts  she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana  shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors  theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user  its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff  the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny  its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick  and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable 
"I liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the Amazon, a part of the world that always has intrigued me. I believe a condensed form of the book was published in ""Reader's Digest"" soon after the actual event occurred.<br /><br />Because I am a ""baby boomer,"" the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and for this reason I related to the film. I also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character's following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help, as well as other survival techniques. Most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope viewers learn something from it, in addition seeing it for entertainment.<br /><br />I do wish the movie would be released in VHS and DVD soon as I should like to add it to my video collection. It also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels.",1,i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon  a part of the world that always has intrigued me  i believe a condensed form of the book was published in  readers digest  soon after the actual event occurred  because i am a  baby boomer   the character and the actress are my contemporaries  and for this reason i related to the film  i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the characters following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help  as well as other survival techniques  most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude  in conclusion  i hope viewers learn something from it  in addition seeing it for entertainment  i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection  it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels 
"The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller (looking surprisingly aged a year after ""Tarzan and the Huntress"") is bad, in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller, shooting in beautiful scenery in México, with a top star of that country (Andrea Palma) and multiple award-winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, and bringing in prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to do the score. Although it may have cost less for filming abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series, taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania, and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director, instead of Robert Florey, who gives it a very slow pace. Neumann had done a fine work with ""Tarzan and the Amazons"", ""Tarzan and the Leopard Woman"" and ""Tarzan and the Huntress"", and finished his career directing the classic ""The Fly"" the year before his death; while Florey became a television director, after a career of few remarkable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs (that have a Caribbean air, in a location supposed to be Africa and shot in México!) Boring and decidedly of dubious taste, it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller's Tarzan.",0,the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller  looking surprisingly aged a year after  tarzan and the huntress   is bad  in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better  it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller  shooting in beautiful scenery in méxico  with a top star of that country  andrea palma  and multiple award winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa  and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score  although it may have cost less for filming abroad  it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series  taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania  and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu  especially the exterior  built on steep rocks   kurt neumann should have stayed as director  instead of robert florey  who gives it a very slow pace  neumann had done a fine work with  tarzan and the amazons    tarzan and the leopard woman  and  tarzan and the huntress   and finished his career directing the classic  the fly  the year before his death  while florey became a television director  after a career of few remarkable films  if weissmuller looks tired  the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others  but the worst character is benji  an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs  that have a caribbean air  in a location supposed to be africa and shot in méxico   boring and decidedly of dubious taste  it was a sad farewell to weissmullers tarzan 
"'Intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I'm a middle-aged married father of two. I'm quite functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I have pain from my past that I use addictions to soothe, and issues from which I am slowly recovering. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family.<br /><br />The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, ""the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood."" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about killing pain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, ""collapse in a heap on the floor"" and have their lives forever changed by the event.<br /><br />For example, last night's counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a 75-year old neighbor and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives. Often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable.<br /><br />To the producers: Thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. Also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant.<br /><br />To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether or not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.",1,intervention has helped me with my own addictions and recovery  im a middle aged married father of two  im quite functional in my personal and professional life  still  i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe  and issues from which i am slowly recovering  when these addicts and their families share their lives with me  they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family  the show  unlike many others  digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction  many of us suffer because its too scary to go back and do  as alice miller says   the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood   the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started  this digging is painful and difficult  but worth it  so much coverage of addiction    fictional and non fictional    seems to ignore the underlying issues  often its assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self interest  and now they cant stop  not so  addictions are about killing pain  i can relate to the different events and hardships in peoples lives  there are common themes  and surprising exceptions  many addicts have suffered miserable abuse  some kids simply respond badly to divorce  to those who think that addiction is an over reaction to a hardship  i would just say that different people respond differently  although some kids handle divorce well  others  like cristy in the show   collapse in a heap on the floor  and have their lives forever changed by the event  for example  last nights counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men  she strips for cash for a 75 year old neighbor and lets men abuse her  sound familiar to anyone  the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives  often its those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest  as they say  even a stopped watch is right twice a day  but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while  until its made your life miserable  to the producers  thank you for making the show  for digging into the past  for the follow ups  also  the graphics  the format  and the theme music are brilliant  to the addicts  thank you for your courage to share  whether or not you have helped yourself  you have helped me 
"When ""Good Times"" premiered in 1974, it was one the first black family sitcoms. It centered on the poor Chicago-based Evans family and their struggles to make ends. Most of the early episodes focused on the parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide for the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were terrific actors and had great chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They had three kids: J.J., Thelma, and Michael. J.J. was the skirt-chasing but well-meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of subtletly with artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, bright girl who was constantly trading insults with J.J. Michael was a near child prodigy who was well-educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer.<br /><br />In 1976, the producers made a huge mistake by firing John Amos, literally killing off his character. This really changed the focus, and not for the good I might add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon-like behavior which angered black viewers as well as series star Esther Rolle, who left after the next season. Instead of a show that focused on key African-American issues that existed in society at the time, viewers got shows that were overloaded with skirt chasing and fat jokes.<br /><br />Once Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Although it was still watchable, it was no longer the great ground-breaking show that it once was.<br /><br />Although Esther Rolle came back for the 1978 season, it became obvious that the show was on its last legs. All loose ends were tied up during that season and the show quietly faded off the air.<br /><br />First three season: A.

"I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid. I snuck downstairs really early one morning, started watching HBO, and The Raft (segment 2) terrorized me good. This time around, I still enjoyed The Raft, although I couldn't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short. The other two segments were complete trash. I can't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk. All I've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of tainted childhood classics. 4/10",0,i rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid  i snuck downstairs really early one morning  started watching hbo  and the raft  segment 2  terrorized me good  this time around  i still enjoyed the raft  although i couldnt tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short  the other two segments were complete trash  i cant believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk  all ive accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory  creepshow 2 will now join rad among my list of tainted childhood classics  4 10

"In this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies. This is amusing at first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances, how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.<br /><br />Characters often interact in a peculiar way, with no tact or manners or respect. I believe this is intentional, not bad acting. After all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave like that.<br /><br />I didn't like most of the action scenes, apart the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. The plot isn't too polished. But the great scenes and ideas - like the death of Sol, the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with, the ""furniture"" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film.<br /><br />8 out of 10.",1,in this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies  this is amusing at first  but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances  how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable  characters often interact in a peculiar way  with no tact or manners or respect  i believe this is intentional  not bad acting  after all  who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated citys inhabitants behave like that  i didnt like most of the action scenes  apart the death of the priest  too cheap even for the seventies  the plot isnt too polished  but the great scenes and ideas   like the death of sol  the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with  the  furniture    outweigh the shortcomings of this film  8 out of 10

It is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues Leo Genn.

"""Whipped"" is one of the most awful films of all time. It is a mean, hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000, besides maybe ""The Grinch."" It is not, as people have called it, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. That would be a little film called ""High Fidelity."" Whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic, ""Whipped"" is hostile, cynical, misanthropic cinematic poison.

This was the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of I'm from Kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all. Its like they took BTK name and made up the rest.

"Man, what the hell were the people who made this film on? And more importantly where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire, transforming into a werewolf. And this is no Rick Baker 'American werewolf' transformation, folks. We're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here. I can just imagine some stoned Italian spreading glue on naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the film's protagoness (is that a word?)), and asking her to roll in fur. That's how bad it is.<br /><br />From here on in it doesn't get much better. Minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about Daniela and her condition or something (I can't remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at it you'll cry).<br /><br />The funny thing is Daniela isn't even a werewolf, she's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around (understandable, as she was raped as a child) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor (the opening scene). She can't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets, and she only wants to be loved! Things start looking up for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn't trigger her 'episodes'. Check out the montage here, one of the cheesiest you'll ever see (laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window).<br /><br />Daniela's luck doesn't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn, she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman. Reminiscent of ""I spit on your grave"", Daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists.<br /><br />This is 100 minutes of my life I will never get back. But hey, that's the game you play when you're a film geek.",0,man  what the hell were the people who made this film on  and more importantly where can i get some  the opening scene sets the tone for the film  a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire  transforming into a werewolf  and this is no rick baker american werewolf transformation  folks  were talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here  i can just imagine some stoned italian spreading glue on naked annik borel  who plays daniela  the films protagoness  is that a word     and asking her to roll in fur  thats how bad it is  from here on in it doesnt get much better  minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about daniela and her condition or something  i cant remember  but the dialogue is so bad if you dont laugh at it youll cry   the funny thing is daniela isnt even a werewolf  shes a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around  understandable  as she was raped as a child  so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor  the opening scene   she cant help but tear out the throat of every man she meets  and she only wants to be loved  things start looking up for daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesnt trigger her episodes  check out the montage here  one of the cheesiest youll ever see  laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window   danielas luck doesnt hold out as the film takes a brutal turn  she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman  reminiscent of  i spit on your grave   daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists  this is 100 minutes of my life i will never get back  but hey  thats the game you play when youre a film geek 
"I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so believe me when I say this film is worth seeing. Overall, the story and gags are contrived, but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off. That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself isn't terribly intelligent, but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter. Very few of the film's gags are high-brow, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /><br />The characters are likable, too. I must say I wish I got to see more of James Brolin's character, since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in. Plus, I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife (who serves as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikable, and there's never a scene where I thought to myself, ""Why did he want to marry her in the first place?"" The ending is Hollywood-ish, but it could've been much more schmaltzy. <br /><br />The cast is talented. I haven't had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee's mainstream work. I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles. And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles. Even in this movie, he doesn't look perfectly comfortable, but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why she's so damn likable. Of course, she's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality. In other words, her beauty shows inside and out. I don't know the actresses' name, but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and she's always enjoyable to watch, which makes me wish she received better roles. I loved her so much in ""Airplane"" and ""Lost in America"" that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills. <br /><br />Don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. This is a funny, charming film. Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it's always to see a good one among all these bad apples. <br /><br />My score: 7 (out of 10)",1,i was literally preparing to hate this movie  so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing  overall  the story and gags are contrived  but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off  that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs  and tries not to let his boss future father in law and co workers see him scratching himself isnt terribly intelligent  but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter  very few of the films gags are high brow  but they made me laugh  as i said  the film has charm and charm can go a long way   the characters are likable  too  i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolins character  since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in  plus  i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife  who serves as the obstacle in the plot  a total witch  the selma blair character is hardly unlikable  and theres never a scene where i thought to myself   why did he want to marry her in the first place   the ending is hollywood ish  but it couldve been much more schmaltzy   the cast is talented  i havent had a favorable view of most of jason lees mainstream work  i just loved him so much in kevin smiths films that i couldnt help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles  and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles  even in this movie  he doesnt look perfectly comfortable  but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene  but i still miss his work in independent films  julia stiles proves again why shes so damn likable  of course  shes a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint  but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality  in other words  her beauty shows inside and out  i dont know the actresses name  but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious  julie hagerty also has a small part  and shes always enjoyable to watch  which makes me wish she received better roles  i loved her so much in  airplane  and  lost in america  that its a shame she doesnt get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills   dont be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records  this is a funny  charming film  romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet  so its always to see a good one among all these bad apples   my score  7  out of 10 
"After ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" redefined science fiction, and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" redefined ""Star Wars"", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" and the more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans.",1,after  star wars  a new hope  redefined science fiction  and  the empire strikes back  redefined  star wars   its hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two  but this one really does a nice job  the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one  with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films  then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and whats going on in the war  there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellions final confrontation with the emperor  when the battle begins  the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it  and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films  this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy  with the most at stake for the rebellion  this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land  including han solo  chewbacca  and leia   the battle raging on in space  including lando   and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star  which leads up to another duel with darth vader  it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war  and there seems to be no escape  although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far fetched  it didnt seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use  rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers  although they did have some luck fighting them  there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming  which may not be quite as stunning as that of  the empire strikes back   but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well  with the light tone of  a new hope  and the more sinnister tone of  the empire strikes back   this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale  the special edition for  return of the jedi  concentrated on what would have been nice to change  since not much of the original really needed it  fifteen years of technology advancements didnt seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned  and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter  but other than that it was good  the gaping non threatening sarlaacs mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly trap looking head that emerged  which definitely added to the suspense  also  the disco was taken out of jabbas palace  and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy  instead of just a small ewok village  which was the case of the original and that didnt really end a story this big the way it deserved  its hard to say which of the three films was the best  but since its all part of the same story  the over all trilogy is like one big  outstanding film  a third must see for film fans 
"Well, I suppose the good news concerning William Winckler's 2001 opus, ""The Double-D Avenger,"" is that it manages to unite three of Russ Meyer's mammarian marvels--Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix--in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing...or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and there's plenty of it), is that this film--if it can even be called that, having been shot straight to video--is a complete misfire, a total abortion, an out-and-out atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the worst pictures that I have ever seen. Look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, such as it is, deals with Kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oy), and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in L.A. Too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely (you should pardon the expression) flat, that there is ZERO actual nudity in the film at all (other than some old photos of Kitten in her heyday), and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special FX. The Meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth/saggy in the chest, to put it kindly, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), does manage to, uh, stand out nicely. So why have I given this juvenile, unfunny, failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary in the special features of the DVD I just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word ""breast"" from the 1,000+ on his Web site's ""Canonical Hooters List.""

"Let's face it: the final season (#8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever enjoyed (mostly, I've never found dry spells to last a whole season). But if you judge this show by the last season, of course it's going to come across as inferior. That is an entirely unfair assessment-- because ""That '70s Show"" was, in its day, a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there weren't so different than we are here in modern times.<br /><br />All right... ignoring Season 8.<br /><br />Topher Grace stars as Eric Forman, a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next door. Playing their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best one is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get. What country is he from? Try to figure it out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, as Kitty, is both formidable and sweet, sort of like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith's Red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other as Donna's parents, the chauvinistic but likable Bob and the airheaded Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo, a stoner who acts as a father figure to Hyde.<br /><br />Apart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over-the-top lessons that sometimes come (and that deplorable final season), ""'70s"" is a terrific show with amazing writing, spot-on direction, and a feel-good vibe pulsing through every episode.

The Crooks in Mask routine gets old and This cartoon is a change from that. It's not meant to replace the Scooby gang it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers I'm sure. The cartoon's focus is on Scooby and Shaggy who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his goons. Small homages of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time.

"Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed to perfection. It says a lot for the power of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence.

"""Some day, we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun. Some day, when the world is much brighter""- The 5 Stairsteps ""O-o-h Child""<br /><br />Movies about Black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip-hop soundtrack. Films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find, yet there is an undiscovered gem that I would like to recommend. Our Song, by Jim McKay is about three girls in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal and must decide on their future direction, one that may involve going their separate ways. The story is told from the point of view of a 15-year old, not from an adult reminiscing about the past as in most coming of age movies. Avoiding the mandatory street slang and excessive use of F-words, it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroads in their life. The girls: Lanisha (Kerry Washington), Joycelyn (Anna Simpson), and Maria (Melissa Martinez) are in their sophomore year at the local high school. They are active members of the Jackie Robinson Steppers, a real-life marching band whose rehearsals for a Labor Day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives. <br /><br />Similar to David Gordon Green's George Washington but less stylized, the film showcases non-professional black and Latino actors with Kerry Washington as the standout. While the performances have some amateurish moments, I became so involved with the story that I forgot the girls were even acting. Maria, whose father is in jail, has learned that she is pregnant by Terrell, a local student. She wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that Terrell is probably not going to be of much help. Joycelyn works in an up-scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer. In a very poignant scene in her bedroom, she pretends to be talking to her fans, then lies down in bed to recite one of her poems. She is close to Lanisha and Maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood. None of the girls receive much support at home and Maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby. Yet, the single moms are not typical movie deadbeats or alcoholics. They are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family. <br /><br />Lanisha's parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father, a doorman in a luxury apartment building and talk about music. Her mother is comforting when Lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide, a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film. As the summer winds down, the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course. There are no big dramatic moments, however, only the sad recognition of the inevitability of change. Though we do not have blinders on about the frustrations that may await them, we identify with their hopes and dreams without dwelling on the negative. Our Song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility.",1, some day  well walk in the rays of a beautiful sun  some day  when the world is much brighter   the 5 stairsteps  o o h child  movies about black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip hop soundtrack  films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find  yet there is an undiscovered gem that i would like to recommend  our song  by jim mckay is about three girls in the crown heights section of brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal and must decide on their future direction  one that may involve going their separate ways  the story is told from the point of view of a 15 year old  not from an adult reminiscing about the past as in most coming of age movies  avoiding the mandatory street slang and excessive use of f words  it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroads in their life  the girls  lanisha  kerry washington   joycelyn  anna simpson   and maria  melissa martinez  are in their sophomore year at the local high school  they are active members of the jackie robinson steppers  a real life marching band whose rehearsals for a labor day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives   similar to david gordon greens george washington but less stylized  the film showcases non professional black and latino actors with kerry washington as the standout  while the performances have some amateurish moments  i became so involved with the story that i forgot the girls were even acting  maria  whose father is in jail  has learned that she is pregnant by terrell  a local student  she wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that terrell is probably not going to be of much help  joycelyn works in an up scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer  in a very poignant scene in her bedroom  she pretends to be talking to her fans  then lies down in bed to recite one of her poems  she is close to lanisha and maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood  none of the girls receive much support at home and maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby  yet  the single moms are not typical movie deadbeats or alcoholics  they are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family   lanishas parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father  a doorman in a luxury apartment building and talk about music  her mother is comforting when lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide  a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film  as the summer winds down  the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course  there are no big dramatic moments  however  only the sad recognition of the inevitability of change  though we do not have blinders on about the frustrations that may await them  we identify with their hopes and dreams without dwelling on the negative  our song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility

The moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one, but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered. 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was. I stuck it out to the end, but I must admit I played Blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable.",0,this film has an interesting plot  but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor  i was very disappointed  the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one  but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered  2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was  i stuck it out to the end  but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable

This movie is god awful. Not one quality to this movie. You would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad. The effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst I've ever seen. This movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watch Dawn of the dead or Day of the dead. If you want to watch a good cheap shot on video Zombie movie like this but way better than watch Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unwatchable and pointless. You've been warned.

"Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet.<br /><br />The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it was a major city at this time, it's best days already passed by. Secondly, Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the major town at that time was Lübeck.<br /><br />But worse than all that: The directing! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? Impossible! There was not a single believable scene it, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes.<br /><br />I can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent.",0,störtebeker is truly one of the worst tv mini series ever made on this planet  the acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense  just two examples  visby was shown as a village of three houses  instead  it was a major city at this time  its best days already passed by  secondly  hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the baltic sea  hamburg had no access to the baltic sea  the major town at that time was lübeck  but worse than all that  the directing  how can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this  impossible  there was not a single believable scene it  the fights were ridiculous and i could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes  i cant understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent 
"I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of Canadian history, particularly the disservice done to the history of the Mounted Police in the Yukon.<br /><br />I'll leave it to Pierre Berton, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the definitive history of the Klondike gold rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie: <br /><br />The American idea of an untamed frontier, subdued by individual heroes armed with six-guns, was continued in The Far Country, another story about a cowboy from the American west - Wyoming this time - driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns  that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs shack is empty.<br /><br />""Where is the constable? asks Brennan.<br /><br />""Up on the Pelly River. Trouble with the Chilkats,"" someone replies. He's got a real tough job, that constable. He patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time."" <br /><br />The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike. They controlled every route into the Yukon and they brooked no nonsense. They collected customs duties, often over the wails of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation, and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies, or if they simply looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they laid down moral laws for the community. In Dawson the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on Sunday; and plump young women were arrested for what the stern-faced police called ""giving a risqué performance in the theatre,"" generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights.<br /><br />In such a community, a gunbelt was unthinkable. One notorious bad man from Tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable, who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly. The bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman, upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over. ""No man has yet taken a gun away from me,"" said the American. ""Well, I'm taking it"", the constable said mildly and did so, without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece.<br /><br />In 1898, the big year of the stampede, there wasn't a serious crime  let alone a murder  in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith, the Denver confidence man, was remarkable. But in The Far Country Dawson is seen as a community without any law, which a Soapy Smith character from Skagway  he is called Gannon in the picture  can easily control. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant).<br /><br />{in the movie the lone Mountie says} ""Yes I'm the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square miles of it.""<br /><br />""Then why aren't there more of you?""<br /><br />""Because yesterday this was a wilderness. We didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands. Now that you're here, we'll protect you.""<br /><br />""When?""<br /><br />""There'll be a post established here in Dawson early in May.""<br /><br />""What happens between now and May? You going to be here to keep order?""<br /><br />""Part of the time.""<br /><br />""What about the rest of the time?""<br /><br />""Pick yourselves a good man. Swear him in. Have him act as marshal""<br /><br />The movie Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. His astonishing suggestion  that an American town marshal, complete with tin star, be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence  is accepted. Naturally they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal; he clearly fits the part. But Stewart is playing the role of the Loner who looks after Number One and so another man is elected to get shot. And he does. Others get shot. Even Walter Brennan gets shot. Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own. He pins on the tin star and he and the bully, Gannon, blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax.<br /><br />To anybody with a passing knowledge of the Canadian north, this bald re-telling of the story passes rational belief. <br /><br />excerpt from Hollywood's Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.",0,i didnt know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian

"I've found the movie offensive for Americans which lost somebody in the towers, for American people in general. Pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years, each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts (which have none to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize American's political behaviour, or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of September 11.

"The movie has one nude scene: A man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen. It is quite a long scene. What was the point? I almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have THAT staring at us for what seemed like a full minute.<br /><br />The movie is cold. None of the characters are even likeable. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl.<br /><br />I really would not recommend this movie. I had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing. I wondered if the director was from a very upper crust, educated French family and he looks down on these characters.<br /><br />",0,the movie has one nude scene  a man sitting on the edge of the bed  with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen  it is quite a long scene  what was the point  i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasnt funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute  the movie is cold  none of the characters are even likeable  audrey tatou is cute  of course  but her character is an unhappy girl  i really would not recommend this movie  i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing  i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust  educated french family and he looks down on these characters

"I watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed.<br /><br />Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours (or however long it actually was). From the beginning, every single element of this movie is unbelievable. This movie made me chuckle several times, but they were mainly out of shock that the director/writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together.<br /><br />The movie's focus is Gray (Graham) and her issues with intimacy. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly WAY too much in common.<br /><br />Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable, the director keeps taking Gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all. Being an LGBT individual, this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming-out process. (I'll be insulted if the writer's queer.) Had it not been for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was understandably forced), I would give it a negative 3 stars.",0,i watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed  heather graham and tom cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours  or however long it actually was   from the beginning  every single element of this movie is unbelievable  this movie made me chuckle several times  but they were mainly out of shock that the director writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together  the movies focus is gray  graham  and her issues with intimacy  things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly way too much in common  interesting  intriguing  however  instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable  the director keeps taking gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all  being an lgbt individual  this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming out process   ill be insulted if the writers queer   had it not been for the cute chemistry between cavanaugh and graham  which  by the way  was understandably forced   i would give it a negative 3 stars

Peter Ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception, particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan.

Did his bratty and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene York's sudden good fortune?<br /><br />It's only later when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny that the truth's comes out about her strange and evil powers. Jo a New Age type realizes that Delia is a bit weird, after turning all her white crystals black, and calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come over and check her out. Noah is so upset by what he sees in Delia Kirilian color vibrations ,all black and blue with a little pinch of red, that it flips him out so bad that he almost crashed into Delia's moms car.<br /><br />Taken on a trip to a psychic festival by Jo Delia turns the entire event into an inferno setting the place, through mental telepathy, on fire and heaving everyone there run for cover including poor Noah who was at the festival and ended up with his leg broken. The and shaken and battered Guru was so shook up by the whole experience that he later checked out of the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan wilderness. <br /><br />Jo herself is later thrown out, with the help of the sweet and cuddly family pet Ryder, of a second floor window to her death because she knew and talked too much. It's when Karen is again pregnant that she decides, finally, to find out the truth about the real parents of Delia. That's when she,and we in the audience, come face to face with the truth. She's not only the feared AntiChrist of Revelations she's his twin sister! Her brother the AntiChrist himself is about to come on the scene as her kid brother the sill unborn Alexander York!<br /><br />Three times were more then enough for the AntiChrist coming back to earth to bring about Armageddon. The movie going public were already getting a little tired of of him and his evil adventures. With a fourth really not necessary since Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, had been dead and buried for years. Were put through the usual ringer with no one believing that little Delia is ""Thee"" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her deadly rounds of destroying the entire human race. The movie as bad as it is is also far too long, 97 minutes, for a horror flick that could well have told it's story is as little as 80 minutes.<br /><br />Having a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Learner,and later a former Catholic nun sister Yvonne,Megan Lehch,and now faith healer Felichy in the film only to be killed off didn't help the plot either. It only prolonged the suffering of those of us watching the movie.

"I thought that this movies was a letdown I expected it to be so much better than it was. I am so glad I didn't pay to see this movie and that I didn't sit in a movie theater for this one. Where to begin on this movie, the acting in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn't special. I thought that this movie was suppose to be great, but it wasn't more than a cheesy waste of time. I think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just wasn't there. I think that if maybe we had a different actor play Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might have been better but the entire time I watched this movie he looked high and I didn't get the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but, there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few one liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. I think that Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he needs to stick with the Burger King commercials. I think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director. The storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just OK guy love storyboring I think that it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a letdown nothing. I honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie. I think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie. So save yourself the agony and just don't see it.",0,i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was  i am so glad i didnt pay to see this movie and that i didnt sit in a movie theater for this one  where to begin on this movie  the acting in this movie was average  the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasnt special  i thought that this movie was suppose to be great  but it wasnt more than a cheesy waste of time  i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry  it just wasnt there  i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didnt get the feeling that he wasnt acting in this movie  now  alice eve did a great job as an actress but  there was no chemistry between her and jay  all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie  the humor in this movie was not funny at all  there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand  i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldnt decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy  i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials  i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director  the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyboring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality  but what a letdown nothing  i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie  i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie  so save yourself the agony and just dont see it 
"I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. Although I don't remember much about it, I must say that it was a pretty good show. Also, I don't think I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the theme song. Everyone was ideally cast, the costume design was great. The performances were top-grade, too. I just hope some network brings this series back one day so that I'll be able to see every episode. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.

"Maybe I'm missing something because I've read more positive things about The Man Who Cheated Himself than I have read bad reviews - and I just don't get it. I like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak, look, and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. His rumpled, rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing, smooth-talking noir archetype as you'll find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen in a while. She's just not convincing in the role.<br /><br />As for the plot, it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre. I could have predicted the outcome of The Man Who Cheated Himself after about five minutes. And that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull. Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it.",0,maybe im missing something because ive read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews   and i just dont get it  i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak  look  and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura  none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it  take the lead actor  lee j  cobb  his rumpled  rolled out of bed look is about as far from the dashing  smooth talking noir archetype as youll find  or  take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example  this is one of the worst cases of miscasting ive seen in a while  shes just not convincing in the role  as for the plot  its tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre  i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes  and that final cat and mouse chase scene is plain old dull  ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it 
"I gave this loooooooooooong film a ""2"" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can't read like a speed-reader you will NEVER get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish speed talking! And, what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles. Endless stares and goof-eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. Some good cinematography but also some so DARK you think your screen has burned out. How this won anything I will never understand. Difficult to talk about ""ACTING"" since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away. The character Geraldo is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that ANYONE would push him away. And what is with his mother? I just plain didn't GET IT most of the time except that there were three guys that all seem to have had a history with each other....but never figured out who was whose ""EX.""",0,i gave this loooooooooooong film a  2  because of the attractive actors and semi sexy love scenes  otherwise  if you cant read like a speed reader you will never get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the spanish speed talking  and  what the hell is going on in the plot if you cant read the subtitles  endless stares and goof eyes and constant rejection  just boring after an hour or so  some good cinematography but also some so dark you think your screen has burned out  how this won anything i will never understand  difficult to talk about  acting  since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away  the character geraldo is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that anyone would push him away  and what is with his mother  i just plain didnt get it most of the time except that there were three guys that all seem to have had a history with each other    but never figured out who was whose  ex  
"I couldn't agree more with Nomad 7's and I A HVR's comments. A perfect laid back Sunday morning movie. The humor is subtle (exact opposite of ""slapstick"" as one misguided commenter noted).<br /><br />But what always ceases to amaze me is how often I find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over. I originally copied this movie onto VHS about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those Pay Cable free weekend previews(HBO maybe?). Had never heard of it previously. Don't know why it wasn't marketed that well. ?? When DVD's were released en mass, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. Plus, the back drop of Montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either (beautiful).<br /><br />It's probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is? If Adam Sandler type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. The humor is mostly in the dialog.<br /><br />I believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th. But I still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off, I'm going to loose it (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICELESS!).

"This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950's but the majority of his other films are on video if not DVD. That being the case,why isn't this one? A friend recorded it off of TCM for me but to have it on DVD would be great. For special features they could have say a Marine historian talk about the battle and if Mr. Schmid's wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well. Anyway this is a great movie and I highly recommend it.If it ever is put out hopefully it won't be colorized. Colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945,film would go. Mr. Garfield did a superb job of portraying Mr. Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of Mr.Schmid's disability but I feel he got it just right. I sincerely hope they come out with this movie on DVD someday as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War Two.",1,this movie is a fantastic movie  everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing  i know mr  garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd  that being the case why isnt this one  a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great  for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr  schmids wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well  anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it if it ever is put out hopefully it wont be colorized  colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film  the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 film would go  mr  garfield did a superb job of portraying mr  schmid  some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr schmids disability but i feel he got it just right  i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two 
"First off; I'm a dedicated fan of Modesty's, and have been reading the comics since I was a child, and I have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying, but where they fail, this one ROCKS! <br /><br />Well then, here we go: Ms Blaise is working for a casino, a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives. If the robber wins one round, she'll have to tell him about herself. If she wins two times in a row, one of the staff members goes free. (Sounds stupid, yeah, well, I'm not that good at explaining either..) ;)<br /><br />She tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape, living by nature's own rules. They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. As they approach civilization they get caught up in a war, and as they are taken for rebellions, they are being shot at and the old man dies, which leaves her to meet the city by herself.<br /><br />Then she meets the man who's casino she's now working for, and there the story ends. <br /><br />What is to follow is that there's an awesome fight and the line's are totally cool. Alexandra Staden is a TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! Just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic-one.<br /><br />Feels awkward though, too hear Modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but that's not relevant since the comic book- blaise can't speak out loud, but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent. (Not to mention that it's weird everybody's speaking English in the Balkan..)<br /><br />The acting is really good, even the child who personifies the young Blaise must have a applaud! <br /><br />My favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber's ass! Totally awesome! :D I can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie/s!<br /><br />Watch it, you won't be disappointed!",1,first off  im a dedicated fan of modestys  and have been reading the comics since i was a child  and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying  but where they fail  this one rocks   well then  here we go  ms blaise is working for a casino  a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives  if the robber wins one round  shell have to tell him about herself  if she wins two times in a row  one of the staff members goes free   sounds stupid  yeah  well  im not that good at explaining either       she tells him about growing up in a war zone  without parents or friends  about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape  living by natures own rules  they hunt for food  and he teaches her to read and fight  as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war  and as they are taken for rebellions  they are being shot at and the old man dies  which leaves her to meet the city by herself  then she meets the man whos casino shes now working for  and there the story ends   what is to follow is that theres an awesome fight and the lines are totally cool  alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise  just as modest and strong  graceful and intellectual as the comic one  feels awkward though  too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent  but thats not relevant since the comic book  blaise cant speak out loud  but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent   not to mention that its weird everybodys speaking english in the balkan    the acting is really good  even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud   my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robbers ass  totally awesome   d i cant wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie s  watch it  you wont be disappointed 
"The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man-vs.-woman-argue-all-the-time-but-wind up-in love-type of Hollywood screwball romance/comedy.<br /><br />I usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple. The supporting cast is outstanding - from the always-likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /><br />Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career. He takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him. That ""twist"" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind.<br /><br />Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of that.

"This movie ""Joshua"" is extremely disturbing, and downright pointless. It actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it. Without giving away the story it is about a young boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. During the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable. Adding insult to injury, by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less, who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults. There is no redemption, no justice served, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely unsettling. Even for those who might enjoy horror movies, this movie could be too much. Despite the fact this movie was well acted, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist's waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure.",0,this movie  joshua  is extremely disturbing  and downright pointless  it actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it  without giving away the story it is about a young boys reaction to his newborn sister  and that is just the tip of the iceberg  during the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable  adding insult to injury  by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less  who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults  there is no redemption  no justice served  and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them  frankly  i did not enjoy watching this movie  it was extremely unsettling  even for those who might enjoy horror movies  this movie could be too much  despite the fact this movie was well acted  the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentists waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure 
"This is a sad film made for sad people. I was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart, wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe-inducing scenes after another. And there were people roaring with laughter behind me, which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse-s**t.<br /><br />Nikkhil Advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters. The screenplay is dull, probably he was drunk when he was writing this film. There is no strong hold on any of these stories. Nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before. One of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it. I mean seriously is this story really required? Its not funny, not creative but only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy. Another of the stories (which was probably the only story I was interested in) is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age-old sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap. I have no idea what the Salmaan-Priyanka plot was all about. There was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot. She can't take Karan Johar's film because she has to marry Salmaan ?? Why can't she marry him and still take the film ?? or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married?? With six actors in the film obviously Advani cant produce the film all by himself. So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group, shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines. And also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore!! I come to IMDb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film. It just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are. With fans like these, movies like Salaam E Ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit.",0,this is a sad film made for sad people  i was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart  wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe inducing scenes after another  and there were people roaring with laughter behind me  which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse s  t  nikkhil advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters  the screenplay is dull  probably he was drunk when he was writing this film  there is no strong hold on any of these stories  nothing new   nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before  one of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it  i mean seriously is this story really required  its not funny  not creative but only proves that advani has no sense of comedy  another of the stories  which was probably the only story i was interested in  is based on a mans infidelity and that too ends in a lame age old sati savitri pati parmeshwar crap  i have no idea what the salmaan priyanka plot was all about  there was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot  she cant take karan johars film because she has to marry salmaan    why cant she marry him and still take the film    or does advani and priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married   with six actors in the film obviously advani cant produce the film all by himself  so he makes full use of sponsors like the times group  shamelessly promoting their filmfare magazines  and also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore   i come to imdb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film  it just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are  with fans like these  movies like salaam e ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit 
"Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer.<br /><br />As Europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords & sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.<br /><br />Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief, Sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed & action.<br /><br />The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he's not transformed into a dog) but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film, massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.<br /><br />Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play & dialogue). Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer.<br /><br />The film was begun in Britain, but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites & pinks.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the one great exception. His final movie, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.",1,abu  the thief of bagdad  helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer  as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames  sir alexander kordas london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights  replete with swords   sorcery  it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines  it also is a fine piece of film making  featuring good acting and an intelligent script  conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it  playing the evil magician jaffar  his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days  here is a villain worth watching  as the boyish thief  sabu is perfectly cast in this  his third film  while not a hero in the typical sense of the word  his character is certainly heroic in deed   action  the rest of the cast do fine work  john justin is both energetic   sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way  sabu gets a significant part of the action  when hes not transformed into a dog  but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must  lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra  coveted by two very different men  appearing late in the film  massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude  allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller  miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra  forever dithering on about his mechanical toys  malleson was also responsible for the films screen play   dialogue   aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend  mary morris  later an exceptional stage actress  plays the dual roles of jaffars accomplice and the six armed silver dancer  the film was begun in britain  but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california  which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast  the art direction  in vibrant technicolor  is most attractive  especially the fairy tale architecture in blues  whites   pinks                            born sabu dastagir in 1924  sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysores stables when he was discovered by kordas company and set before the cameras  his first four films  elephant boy 1937  the drum 1938  the thief of bagdad 1940  jungle book 1942  were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed  after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career  but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films  black narcissus  1947  being the one great exception  his final movie  walt disneys a tiger walks  1964  was an improvement  but it was too late  sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963  only 39 years of age 
"Trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable. It was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young. The performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.<br /><br />Observation. In film it isn't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile. ""Small morality"" storytelling is quaint (or coy) only in the eye of the beholder--thankfully. Story content--well told--can overcome it's time, subject or place.<br /><br />Ironically, there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era.

"A terrible movie containing a bevy of D-list Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.<br /><br />This film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It's not even camp enough to be funny.<br /><br />I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa.<br /><br />Didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic' (!?! for lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, overlaid with completely derivative special effects. Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? <br /><br />Learn from the mistakes of others ... don't even waste your time with this one, you'll regret it like I did.

"The story line has been rehashed a number of times; ""a breath of life in the retirement home"". Several plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end, but it's still an excellent platform for character studies.<br /><br />If 'Gideon' was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches (even the subtitle and summary of Gideon's ""simple wisdom"" almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness). Mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film, but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors' lack of focus almost irrelevant.",0,the story line has been rehashed a number of times   a breath of life in the retirement home   several plays  movies  novels  short stories  poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end  but its still an excellent platform for character studies  if gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant  but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches  even the subtitle and summary of gideons  simple wisdom  almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness   mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film  but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant 
"The youthful group in ""St. Elmo's Fire"" who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university.

"The story idea behind THE LOST MISSILE isn't bad at all, but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub-par level.<br /><br />The film begins with a missile heading towards the Earth. In a panic because it's about to strike the Earth, the Soviets manage to deflect the object. This isn't necessarily good, however, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words, with each pass it makes, a swath of death follows--one that could potentially kill us all!! So, it's up to the good scientists of the US (led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us--and especially save New York that is in its immediate flight path! Unfortunately, they aren't able to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can't say whether or not this is a big loss) but thanks to good old American know-how, they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction!! <br /><br />So, as you can see, the story idea isn't bad and rather original. But, so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding. Overall, a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like--all others, see it at your own risk.",0,the story idea behind the lost missile isnt bad at all  but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub par level  the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth  in a panic because its about to strike the earth  the soviets manage to deflect the object  this isnt necessarily good  however  as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet  in other words  with each pass it makes  a swath of death follows  one that could potentially kill us all   so  its up to the good scientists of the us  led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia  to formulate and plan to save us  and especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path  unfortunately  they arent able to save ottawa  ive never been there  so i cant say whether or not this is a big loss  but thanks to good old american know how  they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction    so  as you can see  the story idea isnt bad and rather original  but  so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding  overall  a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like  all others  see it at your own risk 
"Salvage is the worst so called horror film I've ever seen. There is nothing remotely horrific about it. It doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine. First of all i don't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie. If I wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it. Second: the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly. Third: the story sucks, its been used before, and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summery on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it. I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their name. All hail Anthony Perkins!!!!!!!!!",0,salvage is the worst so called horror film ive ever seen  there is nothing remotely horrific about it  it doesnt deserve to be in a genre so fine  first of all i dont see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie  if i wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it  second  the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly  third  the story sucks  its been used before  and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse  read the summery on the back of the case  it reveals the whole story  i do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it  i feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name  all hail anthony perkins         
"The fourth ""Tremors"" feature goes back in time, to the year 1889. ""The Legend Begins"" in the small city of ""Perfection"", which was then ""Rejection, Nevada"". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly ""Graboids"". Some of the characters in the present-day ""Tremors"" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is inept with firearms; so, he hires gunslinger Billy Drago (as ""Black Hand"" Kelly) to shoot 'em up some ""Dirt Dragons"".<br /><br />This one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster ""Graboids"". These tamer ""Dirt Dragons"" are nowhere near as terrorizing as their ""Tremors"" (1990) counterparts. Consequently, in this film, the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie. And, it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly, when Gross temporarily decides to leave town. Why so helpless? Why didn't Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) immediately rally the people to fight without Gross? Disappointing.<br /><br />**** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S.

"Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show I very highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different. I am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV so if i want to see it I have to buy the DVDs and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time (which is highly depressing). However this program is very very good and is a must see, but be warned it is highly addictive.

"Come on, let's get real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or the Knights Templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century. The story is so laughable that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides, if you wanted to have a real-life Templar, why not just use the Knights of Christ, who are still in existence in Portugal. At least they should have taken history into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or Gothic period pieces.

"I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old ""sparkle"", however the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and Sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school.

"Much about love & life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.<br /><br />Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film. With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie. Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the Lubitsch touch.'<br /><br />Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural - perfectly conveys their confusion & quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates. Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema.<br /><br />Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold. An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented. Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments - near the end - when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him.

"""The Godfather"" of television, but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters, the two are nothing alike. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families -- in one family he is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband, and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually derive from his mother Livia, who's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and latching. Chianese, the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a Godfather film, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are ""okay"" but not notable (with the exception of Iler's stunning performance in the third-to-last episode, ""The Second Coming""); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top, but the show is too strong for them to hold it back.

"I was excited when I heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie. The whole era (1980's Southern California) and subject matter (drug and porn industry) is intriguing to me. I thought this would be a sure fire hit. I was not thrilled with the choice of Kilmer as Holmes, they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms. I guess he sells tickets? However, I was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot. I was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing. Now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do, I will admit that. There were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act. John Holmes was there, but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family (and self) if he talked to police about it. In fact, Holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved. So this was still really one big mystery, a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on. The person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead. However, there is no real storyline, it is fragmented claptrap. The script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting. The film gives no insight into Holmes or the other people involved. Kilmer's character disappears for long stretches, his girlfriend is dull, the police are jokes. Even Kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial. It is a very shallow piece and dare I say, boring. The director even tries to turn it into a love story. Which is nice, unless you know anything about what a piece of trash John Holmes really was. Perhaps a couple of viewings of Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" might have helped here. ""Boogie Nights"" was innovative and exciting in all regards. This film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style. Even the music is out of place, with Duran Duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980. Then we have Gordon Lightfoot? Gordon Lightfoot? There could have been a great film based on this gruesome event, but I have not seen it yet. I have not seen even a decent one yet (unless you consider the Rahad Jackson scene from Boogie Nights).",0,i was excited when i heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie  the whole era  1980s southern california  and subject matter  drug and porn industry  is intriguing to me  i thought this would be a sure fire hit  i was not thrilled with the choice of kilmer as holmes  they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms  i guess he sells tickets  however  i was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot  i was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing  now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do  i will admit that  there were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act  john holmes was there  but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family  and self  if he talked to police about it  in fact  holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved  so this was still really one big mystery  a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on  the person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead  however  there is no real storyline  it is fragmented claptrap  the script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting  the film gives no insight into holmes or the other people involved  kilmers character disappears for long stretches  his girlfriend is dull  the police are jokes  even kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial  it is a very shallow piece and dare i say  boring  the director even tries to turn it into a love story  which is nice  unless you know anything about what a piece of trash john holmes really was  perhaps a couple of viewings of andersons  boogie nights  might have helped here   boogie nights  was innovative and exciting in all regards  this film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style  even the music is out of place  with duran duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980  then we have gordon lightfoot  gordon lightfoot  there could have been a great film based on this gruesome event  but i have not seen it yet  i have not seen even a decent one yet  unless you consider the rahad jackson scene from boogie nights  
"A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but...<br /><br />Rudolph's glowing nose didn't require the ""explanation"" offered in this film - much like The Force in the Star Wars films didn't need the explanation of ""medichlorians in the bloodstream."" But mainly, the film left me cold because of Winterbolt's over-complicated plot to destroy Santa. He's got the power to put suggestions into people's minds, so why does he do things in such a roundabout way? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the Frosty family...The comedically exaggerated plots of Pinky and the Brain and ""Phineas and Ferb's"" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs) seem simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt's, which we're expected to take somewhat seriously.<br /><br />There is a particularly (and amusingly) strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy, like boomerangs.

"I wouldn't dare say this film is better than the original, but it is very good in it's own right. The comedy in this film is just as good as the original though, there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them.<br /><br />The story in this film is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great. Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast. The core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles. I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films as I did Alex Winter's Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays the part of Ted Logan's father does a really good job. The scene where Ted possesses his fathers body and Hal London Jr begins acting like Ted is a great scene, and he pulls it off impressively well. I can't forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he completely made the movie for me. The rest of the cast is quite good as well.<br /><br />If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, then I would hope you would like this film as well. But, don't expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,<br /><br />-Chris",1,i wouldnt dare say this film is better than the original  but it is very good in its own right  the comedy in this film is just as good as the original though  there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them  the story in this film is even more bizarre than the original  but thats what makes it so great  peter hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast  the core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles  i dont care what anyone says  i think keanu reeves is a great actor  i really enjoyed his portrayal of ted in both of these films as i did alex winters bill  i was very happy to see george carlin returning to the role of rufus  very cool  hal london jr  who plays the part of ted logans father does a really good job  the scene where ted possesses his fathers body and hal london jr begins acting like ted is a great scene  and he pulls it off impressively well  i cant forget to mention william sadler as death  he completely made the movie for me  the rest of the cast is quite good as well  if you liked the first installment of the bill and ted series  then i would hope you would like this film as well  but  dont expect it to be as good as the original  i really hope you enjoy the film  thanks for reading   chris
it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end. why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes! most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best. also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it. if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since. the ending sucked but the rest was great,0,it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end  why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes  most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best  also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it  if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since  the ending sucked but the rest was great
"Here's the skinny, it seems that this is much older then I thought it was. But it's still cool. The bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part. There are some character issues that I hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a MACROSS knock off. Not just the animation style but several character designs. For example all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY of MACROSS. The mechs look similar to MACROSS as well as the other characters. This is really not made for little kids, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So to make a long story short I give this cool MACROSS knock-off 7 STARS.",1,heres the skinny  it seems that this is much older then i thought it was  but its still cool  the bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part  there are some character issues that i hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a macross knock off  not just the animation style but several character designs  for example all the girls in this movie look like lyn minmay of macross  the mechs look similar to macross as well as the other characters  this is really not made for little kids  it has graphic violence  nudity and graphic sexual content  so to make a long story short i give this cool macross knock off 7 stars 
"Well I must say this is probably the worst film I have seen this year! The jokes were extremely crude (wasn't expecting it from as PG movie)(Rated PG in Canada) and they weren't funny! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I didn't even get that. I am a huge Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed by his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them. I didn't expect this at all as in the past I have really liked other movies by this director (Six Days, Seven Nights for example) This movie was NOT worth the $10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie.

"I read a couple of good reviews on this board for ""Mr. Scarface"", but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself, the picture will probably make very little sense. Indeed, after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam, the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them. For all of his buildup as the title character, Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale, making the U.S. working title, ""Mr. Scarface"", rather moot. I've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they don't all work; I guess in this case, my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it either.",0,i read a couple of good reviews on this board for  mr  scarface   but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of italian gangster films like myself  the picture will probably make very little sense  indeed  after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam  the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of ricks  al cliver  character  the whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of vinchenzo napoli  vittorio caprioli   but as most other viewers commented  hes about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence  i found it somewhat unbelievable that manzaris goons who chased tony through the streets didnt actually stroke out before tony even laid a hand on them  for all of his buildup as the title character  jack palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale  making the u s  working title   mr  scarface   rather moot  ive seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that they dont all work  i guess in this case  my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didnt quite make it either 
Eddie Izzard is genius with his non-stop humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of discovery (such as the Heimlich Maneuver) is creative.

"While this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film, it's surprisingly watchable on several levels. First, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick). While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair (I never saw him this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesn't mean he can't eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first movie (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s.<br /><br />A second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are wading through the water, it's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry!!! Horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film--so much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the film--since both of them starred in many grade-z horror films. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film.<br /><br />So, while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over-generous, it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans.",0,while this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film  its surprisingly watchable on several levels  first  for old movie fans  its interesting to see the leading role played by dean jagger  no relation to mick   while jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor  even garnering the oscar in this category for 12 oclock high   here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair  i never saw him this way before  and because he was by far the worst actor in the film  this film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesnt mean he cant eventually learn to be a great actor  another good example of this phenomenon is paul newman  whose first movie  the silver chalice  is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s  a second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all  the writing is bad  the acting is bad and the special effects are bad  for example  when jagger and an unnamed cambodian are wading through the water  its obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them  plus  once they leave the water  their costumes are 100  dry    horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film  so much so that its hard to imagine why they didnt ask bela lugosi or george zucco to star in the film  since both of them starred in many grade z horror films  in many ways  this would be a perfect example for a film class on how not to make a film  so  while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over generous  its fun to laugh at and short so its worth a look for bad film fans 
"This film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film! The plot is somewhat lacking, but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference.

"(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON)<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />This was a drive-in feature, co-billed with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback, riding off with his 'man-eating' dog behind him.<br /><br />The townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down. The murders first began around the time Count Yanos' older brother, Count Igor Dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident.<br /><br />Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) that Igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred corpse back to life.<br /><br />But of course Igor is still alive (although horribly burned) and stalking and killing the women in the village.

"""Plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms"", informs one dopey would-be victim in ""The Seedpeople"", a silly, flaccid remake of ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"", ""Day of the Triffids"", and about a thousand udder moovies. And why are seeds moore dangerous than plants, one might ask? Because, according to the same dolt, ""seeds can chase us"". Yes, I can remember one horrifying incident when the MooCow was just a calf, being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed... Yeah, right. Unfortunately, the ""monsters"" in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets, some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds, others which sail about on strings. There's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here. For reasons left unexplained, the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra-violet lights, even though they can walk about in the daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy. As you can see, not much thought was put into this cow flop.

"There is one really good scene in Faat Kine. The title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened, Faat Kine sprays her in the face. The scene works because the act is so unexpected, bizarre, and rather funny at the same time. In that one instance, writer/director Ousmane Sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for, an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours. In the scene, he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions. For the rest of the movie, the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones. <br /><br />The tone is all over the place. It's true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre, but I don't think Faat Kine fits into any genre. Supposedly, it's a drama, though there are moments of such broad comedy (the aforementioned spraying in the face) that it cannot be taken seriously. On the other hand, the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics Sembene has crammed into the picture. There is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together. Unfortunately, Semebene doesn't find that balance. Instead, one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason, leaving two different tones hanging in the wind. <br /><br />Faat Kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale. The film ends with a big party where all the characters' conflicts are resolved, only they aren't resolved quickly. The scene lasts longer than any other scene, going on for probably twenty minutes. Because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering, the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene, making for a frustrating viewing experience.<br /><br />Perhaps I am being too hard on Faat Kine. I am not the right audience for it. I felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story. There are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters. However, I was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it.",0,there is one really good scene in faat kine  the title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened  faat kine sprays her in the face  the scene works because the act is so unexpected  bizarre  and rather funny at the same time  in that one instance  writer director ousmane sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for  an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours  in the scene  he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions  for the rest of the movie  the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones   the tone is all over the place  its true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre  but i dont think faat kine fits into any genre  supposedly  its a drama  though there are moments of such broad comedy  the aforementioned spraying in the face  that it cannot be taken seriously  on the other hand  the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics sembene has crammed into the picture  there is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together  unfortunately  semebene doesnt find that balance  instead  one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason  leaving two different tones hanging in the wind   faat kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale  the film ends with a big party where all the characters conflicts are resolved  only they arent resolved quickly  the scene lasts longer than any other scene  going on for probably twenty minutes  because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering  the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene  making for a frustrating viewing experience  perhaps i am being too hard on faat kine  i am not the right audience for it  i felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story  there are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters  however  i was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it 
"This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting, it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this. Beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth yells the words, ""It's not about you."" to her mother. Those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie. I think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.",1,this was a pretty good movie  i liked it  i thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how its not about dieting  its about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this  beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling  i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words   its not about you   to her mother  those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie  i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie 
"The film looks super on paper. A romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold, especially with this excellent romcomic cast.<br /><br />I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves. Adam Brooks' script may well be to blame but you'd expect better from the Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda. Instead the two ping-pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around France.<br /><br />Jean Reno co-stars amiably as the cop-with-a-heart and I guess wishes he was a star-with-a-part. Mind you he went on to do those Pink Panther remake(s!) so perhaps he was OK with this... 3/10",0,the film looks super on paper  a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross breeding gold  especially with this excellent romcomic cast  im afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves  adam brooks script may well be to blame but youd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda  instead the two ping pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france  jean reno co stars amiably as the cop with a heart and i guess wishes he was a star with a part  mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake s   so perhaps he was ok with this    3 10
"Just watched this after my mother brought it back from America for me, was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but I have to say, yes the acting is cheesy, some of the effects are laughable.<br /><br />But you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was quite good.

This was one of the first CREEPY movies I ever saw...I was about 5 at the time. It scared me GOOD! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster...and my mom got very upset. She had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT! NOW THAT'S A MOVIE! Hey for it's time it was a great movie. That Head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then. And IF your 5 it is VERY SCARY! Kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave NOTHING for your minds imagination. Your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects!

It was absolutely horrible, poor,poor, PITIFUL acting, REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals that weren't even the LEAST BIT funny(unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good). all the boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above 20 bucks a week. This movie is absolutely lousy, it's not worth even renting. In fact don't even watch it on t.v.! Go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! I BARELY give this 1 star(out of 10).

"While filming an 80's horror movie called 'Hot Blooded', the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer. After all of this, the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust. So a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film, as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film. From this it's labelled as a cursed production. Not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from Hollywood to reprise her role, but not as the daughter but the mother. But again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer.<br /><br />Look what 'Scream' started! Hey, I enjoy those films, but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses. During this stage the sub-genre came back with vengeance, but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts, where they followed the derivative pattern of the Scream franchise. 'Cut' which is an independent Australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick. But you know what, I found it a cheesy delight. Yeah, It's gawd awful and highly forgettable, but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted. Although I did hate it when I originally came across it, but the second time around I knew what I was getting myself into and it worked better for it. It was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again, but this time it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />The film came out around the same time as 'Scream 3' and 'Urban Legends: The Final Cut' did, which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie. 'Scream 3' is obviously the strongest of the three, but I would actually watch this trash over Urban Legends: The Final Cut. Though, it did seem more of a throwback to the 80's slashers than that of one of Scream's bastard offspring. Pretty much the film is given b-grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances. The dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense. While, the performances are pure mockery and Molly Ringwald takes the crown for it. She plays the wash-up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and I had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send-up performance. She provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly. The rest were mostly recognizable Australian TV stars (that's if you're an Australian) with a ravishing Jessica Napier leading the cast with the likes of Stephen Curry and Frank Roberts. Also pop singer (and supposed actress) Kylie Minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up! Nice. These teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim-witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed. Sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue, because they have no real substance to be there.<br /><br />The plot starts off rather interestingly, then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up, but then it makes a sudden u-turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre. Simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness I was kind of left thinking oh my. This when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner, but sadly it falls along way. But don't you just love an opening ending. Also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential, tongue-in-cheek approach. Predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over-stated at times, but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit. The atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness, but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added 'some' spookiness. The cinema scene is done rather nicely too.<br /><br />Now, now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick, but sadly there's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard, if lacking but it's more then decent for such low-budget flick. There are one or two creative deaths, but the rest are systematic. The killer wasn't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it I thought, well the smart-ass attitude didn't sit well with me. Another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut-away editing, out-of-place soundtrack and Kimble Rendall's direction lacked execution and was pretty careless, but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness.<br /><br />The imagination matches the budget that's for sure, but heck this lousy slasher wasn't trying to be anything else.

"The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it...or me. It is not a good movie. Terrible in fact. But terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. It would have made a great MST3K subject!<br /><br />Most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contrived plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You'll thrill to slo-mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off, but WHO'S SHOT? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one finally goes down. You'll sing along (in latin of course) with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death's-choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical.<br /><br />So if you believe like I do that as movies get worse they get better, then this might be a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, ""They Live"" featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than luke-warm movies like Omen II or III.<br /><br />I give it 4 out of 10.",0,the fact that i watched this entire movie says something about it   or me  it is not a good movie  terrible in fact  but terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away  it would have made a great mst3k subject  most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here  bad dialogue  inappropriate music  contrived plot sequences  ridiculous pseudoscience  youll thrill to slo mo death sequences  the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom  facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths  your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off  but whos shot  both look at themselves  then the other  then themselves  then  seemingly 15 minutes later   one finally goes down  youll sing along  in latin of course  with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly deaths choir that  for a moment  threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical  so if you believe like i do that as movies get worse they get better  then this might be a decent choice for you  its not as funny as my current sci fi schlock favorite   they live  featuring rowdy roddy piper  but its more fun to watch than luke warm movies like omen ii or iii  i give it 4 out of 10 
"Expecting to see another Nunsploitation movie with a mean Mother Superior abusing and torturing her charges, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I had anticipated.<br /><br />It actually has a feminist storyline, though I don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set. It certainly wasn't practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society. Throughout the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it, albeit with disastrous results.<br /><br />The pre-credit sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. She sees an injured ""evil"" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to assist him. Before she can, her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). After this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. Though scenes do involve violence, rape and nuns, I would consider this more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /><br />Indeed, many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there, but the acting, camera-work, storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level. Most ""nun"" films I've seen usually have the basic premise of: A good girl somehow winds up in a convent, where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell.<br /><br />Flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited (but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me, but it's a lot easier for guys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their liberators (of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, that impales dear Sister Agatha. <br /><br />It is Agatha's death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time. I don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. This is a great film, so don't be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic. Plus, how on Earth could a movie featuring Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I am not familiar with María Casares' other works, but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character.<br /><br />I have read many great reviews of the Synapse (US) release, but I love my German X-Rated Kult DVD copy. It isn't anamorphic/16:9, but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than Synapse's release.<br /><br />And there are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many from Sister Agatha)<br /><br />""Why is God male? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit They're all male!"" -Flavia<br /><br />""These men are afraid- look at them, Sister- Afraid their power will be taken away from them!"" -Sr. Agatha (regarding Christians fleeing after the Muslims arrive)<br /><br />""Woman, where are you going?

"OK, so the FX are not high budget. But this story is based on actual events. Not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer!! As most movies that are based on books, there are somethings that just don't fit. Only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events, not a knock-off as most people believe it is!! This movie is in no way related too TWISTER! Other than both movies are about tornadoes.<br /><br />For those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember... The actual ""night of the twisters"" was June 3, 1980. So this movie was released 16 years after the actual events. Try think how far storm research has advanced in that time. It happened in a larger town; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Even though the movie calls the town something else, and says it's a small town.

"This is the first American film to successfully adopt the naturalistic style used by Europeans, particularly the French and Belgians, for at least a decade, and isn't it about time? Following three high school girls in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years, it does what all good art should: it discovers the universal in the particular. Even though the girls' preoccupations are outwardly conventional--boys, sex, popularity, money, freedom, and clothes--we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped, the universal interface between character and destiny.<br /><br />The naturalism is whole, complete. The film breathes, stays in the moment, inhabits real time. The story tells itself. The medium and its artifacts, for once, are not the message. The film unwaveringly, truthfully conveys the childhood perspective of its characters; it does not impose its own adult meanings or morals. Details emerge of their own, are never pushed, and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement. Even though great pains have been taken to capture the authentic social reality of Crown Heights, part of the largest Black ghetto in New York City and one of the most dangerous violent places in the US, the subject is childhood in the ghetto, not the ghetto itself.<br /><br />Documentary footage of the practice sessions of a marching band, the Jackie Robinson Steppers, punctuate the film at regular intervals with an explosion of color, movement, and sound. Otherwise, the camera stays very close, very intimate, a patient, sly, and unobtrusive observer. The language is rich, spontaneous, the acting transparent. Some scenes standout, such as the girls lolling about, each revealing her deepest fantasies. Lanisha's confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking, one of the deepest scars of the ghetto. Her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving, and beautifully, unsentimentally affirmative.<br /><br />Social realities are respected, not propagandized: All three girls are being raised by single moms, only one, Lanisha, has a father active in her life (and, not coincidentally, of the three she is the most emotionally stable and empathetic to others, and the one with the most self-respect). Two of them suffer from asthma, a disease disproportionately prevalent in the inner city. Gunfire, an accepted daily occurrence, only momentarily interrupts their conversation. Only one of the girls, Joy, feels hope for, feels she has control over the future, while the other two to varying degrees have already accepted despair.<br /><br />This is by far the best dramatic American film I've seen in years.

"It was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan the original 1944 movie. That, to me and many others, is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. Realizing this is simply a shortened made-for-TV film and that most people had trashed it, I didn't expect much, but you can't help but compare this with the '44 film. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at it, and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb.<br /><br />When it was all over, I found it wasn't as bad as I had expected but it's no match for the 1944 original. The two main areas in which this made-for-TV film wasn't as good were (1) the electricity between the two leads was missing and (2) being only 90 minutes, they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those leads. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as ""Walter Neff"" and ""Phyllis Dietrichson,"" respectively.<br /><br />Where this re-make held its own was in the other characters, such as ""Barton Keyes"" and ""Edward Norton."" Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed, so the houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines, etc., were all early '70s instead of mid '40s. Otherwise, the storyline was very similar, just rushed.<br /><br />However, one viewing was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film.",0,it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie  that  to me and many others  is one of the greatest film noirs ever made  realizing this is simply a shortened made for tv film and that most people had trashed it  i didnt expect much  but you cant help but compare this with the 44 film  scene after scene  i found myself comparing what i was looking at it  and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray  barbara stanwyck  edward g  robinson and others  now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna  samantha eggar and lee j  cobb  when it was all over  i found it wasnt as bad as i had expected but its no match for the 1944 original  the two main areas in which this made for tv film wasnt as good were  1  the electricity between the two leads was missing and  2  being only 90 minutes  they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot  characters and chemistry between those leads  crenna and eggar were flat  and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as  walter neff  and  phyllis dietrichson   respectively  where this re make held its own was in the other characters  such as  barton keyes  and  edward norton   cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton  head of the insurance company  it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed  so the houses  cars  telephones  dictating machines  etc   were all early 70s instead of mid 40s  otherwise  the storyline was very similar  just rushed  however  one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film 
"Holy freaking God all-freaking-mighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way... The character acting is the poorest thing I've seen in quite some time. This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO(it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. They're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. Then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be sub-par to 1992's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, Come on, really. It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.",0,holy freaking god all freaking mighty  this movie was so bad  i thought i was on drugs  in a bad way    the character acting is the poorest thing ive seen in quite some time  this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings  imho its a real movie   most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen  my favorite part was when they are in the carriage  and you can tell theres no horse  theyre fleeing from alien monsters  and going about the same speed as a swift jog  then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse  and the cg in general seems to be sub par to 1992s beyond the minds eye  i mean  come on  really  it felt like a horrible episode of hercules  only without kevin sorbo there to save the day  worst  movie  ever 
"What happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers? The premise may sound familiar. The Watchmen? Unbreakable? However, the Russian sci-fi action flick, The Sword Bearer, is far from the standard stock.<br /><br />The story revolves around a man named Sasha who as a boy was shunned from society, his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess. When he wishes or his anger allows, a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin. Very wolverinish? Maybe... but that's not the interesting part of this film. Shunned all his life and driven by anger (and a temper he does have) our ""hero"" returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to. The only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground. This is where the vengeance and anger comes into play. This is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail. He meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about.<br /><br />The film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences. This is art house at it's core, beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action. It's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film. The directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of Sasha and not a straight action film. Don't worry though, the action is there and plenty of it. However, much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath. This is not to say that action is not shown. These scenes are here and are fantastic (especially the ending where we see Sasha's full powers unleashed in desperation). The director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand. This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.",1,what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers  the premise may sound familiar  the watchmen  unbreakable  however  the russian sci fi action flick  the sword bearer  is far from the standard stock  the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society  his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess  when he wishes or his anger allows  a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin  very wolverinish  maybe    but thats not the interesting part of this film  shunned all his life and driven by anger  and a temper he does have  our  hero  returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to  the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flames new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground  this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play  this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail  he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about  the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences  this is art house at its core  beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci fi action  its this odd mash that interests me so much in this film  the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film  dont worry though  the action is there and plenty of it  however  much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath  this is not to say that action is not shown  these scenes are here and are fantastic  especially the ending where we see sashas full powers unleashed in desperation   the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the characters emotional struggle at hand  this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre 
"I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.<br /><br />I watched several documentaries about him. He is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but does this makes him a good director. Definitely NO! A complete anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors  never!<br /><br />He can't direct nor write. His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word ""art"" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.<br /><br />Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store. WHO IS HE KIDDING?<br /><br />He is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising. Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.<br /><br />Just look at Julio Medem.

Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama. All the compositional devices Bach perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained applies to this film. There isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene I feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad. Mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but I feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders I wonder how this work would have ended? As it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.,1,opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama  all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener  and the performer  intrigued and entertained applies to this film  there isnt a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad  mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor  if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended  as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited

"Answer: despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth.<br /><br />The acting in this independent film actually is quite good, despite the less-than-wonderful script. It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten, clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable. Young Anthony de Marco, as Jake, puts in a particularly good performance.<br /><br />Fortunately, the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog. Try it, especially if you're not a monster fan. This is NOT a horror flick. Even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous, and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film, ""Jake's Closet"" is suitable for mature adults.<br /><br />The whole, this time, is much better than the sum of its parts.",1,answer  despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman  your ex is creepier  nastier  and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth  the acting in this independent film actually is quite good  despite the less than wonderful script  it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten  clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable  young anthony de marco  as jake  puts in a particularly good performance  fortunately  the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog  try it  especially if youre not a monster fan  this is not a horror flick  even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous  and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film   jakes closet  is suitable for mature adults  the whole  this time  is much better than the sum of its parts 
"I've seen this movie on several different occasions. I find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it.<br /><br />Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. A lot of old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest-to-goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences, the old people walk out, usually disgusted.<br /><br />Type 2: FILM SNOBS. These people think that just because a movie bears the label of ""Independent"" that it will automatically be a load of hard-to-follow, overemotional crap that may or may not be in English. Yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured. They are really in for a surprise when they see this film. As soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the over-the-top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation, these people will be so dismayed, they will walk out. A few will stay just to see ""how bad it will get"" and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.<br /><br />Type 3: PEOPLE EXPECTING TO SEE LIVE-ACTION ANIME OR MATRIX-LIKE SPECIAL EFFECTS. Sorry folks, the martial arts are pretty solid in the film, but director Yamasato really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing.<br /><br />Type 4: PEOPLE WITH NO EXPECTATIONS. These are the people who really enjoy the film. Whether they had only heard of Blood of the Samurai, picked it at random, or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is: ENTERTAINMENT. This movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought, it was meant (if I may borrow a line of dialogue from the film) to ""really kick some ass."" And that's what it does.<br /><br />So depending on what type of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this film; however, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends.",1,ive seen this movie on several different occasions  i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it  type 1  old people  a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest to goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue  as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences  the old people walk out  usually disgusted  type 2  film snobs  these people think that just because a movie bears the label of  independent  that it will automatically be a load of hard to follow  overemotional crap that may or may not be in english  yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured  they are really in for a surprise when they see this film  as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime inspired sword battles or the over the top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation  these people will be so dismayed  they will walk out  a few will stay just to see  how bad it will get  and later theyll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends  type 3  people expecting to see live action anime or matrix like special effects  sorry folks  the martial arts are pretty solid in the film  but director yamasato really doesnt have the budget for that kind of thing  type 4  people with no expectations  these are the people who really enjoy the film  whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai  picked it at random  or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze  these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is  entertainment  this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought  it was meant  if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film  to  really kick some ass   and thats what it does  so depending on what type of person you are  you may or may not enjoy this film  however  if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting  then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends 
"I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />Intriguing.<br /><br />NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.<br /><br />Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.<br /><br />And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette!

"To fight against the death penalty is a just cause. Everyone who is sane in Europe would think so. In the USA everything is different. The film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving American justice. A young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case. But the film has a sequel. Justice in the USA is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance. Miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance. One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. This Public Attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free. But he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire. He hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance. But he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls. He apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys. One day the local cops follow their intuition, guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl, and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of. They beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and Russian roulette. He confesses. Sent to death row, he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in Massachusetts who is the husband of the Local Public Attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails. It will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice, police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality, some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance. To charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice. The best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention, just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence, which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial, hence easily discardable, with a good lawyer. The film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake, which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief Americans are supposed to have: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."" (Declaration of Independence) Life is an unalienable Right that was given to man by his Creator, which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away. Only God can take the life of a person away. The death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have. Even if we do not evoke God, we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance, and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace. If vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty. And there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of Happiness but of vengeance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",1,to fight against the death penalty is a just cause  everyone who is sane in europe would think so  in the usa everything is different  the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving american justice  a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case  but the film has a sequel  justice in the usa is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance  miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance  one person in the local public attorney offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges  this public attorneys officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free  but he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire  he hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance  but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls  he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys  one day the local cops follow their intuition  guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl  and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of  they beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and russian roulette  he confesses  sent to death row  he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in massachusetts who is the husband of the local public attorneys representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails  it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice  police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality  some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance  to charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice  the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention  just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence  which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial  hence easily discardable  with a good lawyer  the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we dont want to make a mistake  which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have   we hold these truths to be self evident   that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness    declaration of independence  life is an unalienable right that was given to man by his creator  which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away  only god can take the life of a person away  the death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have  even if we do not evoke god  we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance  and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace  if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty  and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance  dr jacques coulardeau  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne  university paris 8 saint denis  university paris 12 créteil  cegid
"I saw this film when I was a young child on television (thank-you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards.<br /><br />Trnka was one of the mentors for Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's National Film Board's best animators. Pojar was, in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka you should see ""Night Angel"".<br /><br />The symbolism is obvious, but deftly used. The oppositions of beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda.<br /><br />What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world. The invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world.<br /><br />Beautiful and haunting film.

"I'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994. A friend and I attended a Canada Day concert in Barrie, and it was a who's who of the top Canadian bands of the age. We got there about 4am, waited in line most of the morning, and when the doors opened at 9am, we were among the first inside the gates. We then waited and waited in the hot sun, slowly broiling but we didn't care, because the headliners were among our favourites. At one point, early in the afternoon, I sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier. I was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a Rheostatics t-shirt. This is the reason I have hated the Rheostatics to this day. There's nothing reasonable, nor taste-determined, nor really anything except their fandom. Snotty of me, isn't it? So, I, in my hatred of the band, have denied myself the delight that is Whale Music.<br /><br />Desmond Howl had it all. It's hard to say what he's lost, since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains (the BC region where the movie was shot is breathtaking). The life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams, phantoms, and his own past, until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in...and, trite as it sounds, breaks him out.<br /><br />Canadian cinema suffers from several problems. Generally, a lack of money, as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help (as if somehow the feature would cease to be Canadian) leads to lower production values than American or British films, and most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like, well, not like an American film. Next, Canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story, and tell it well. Third, they seem to think that gratuitous nudity (often full-frontal) makes something artistic. I'm sure anyone who watches enough Canadian movies, especially late at night on the CBC, knows exactly what I'm talking about. It's almost like a ""don't do this"" handbook exists out there somewhere and Canadian film-makers threw it out a long time ago.<br /><br />In the 90s and 00s, however, some films (such as Bruce McDonald's work and the brilliant C.R.A.Z.Y.) have broken this mold, and managed to maintain what makes them Canadian, while holding onto watchable production values and great stories. Whale Music is such a film, on the surface. Deeper than just its Canadian-isms, it's a deeply moving story of a man who's lost his grip, through grief and excess, who is redeemed by music then by love. And that redeems even the Rheostatics. :)",1,ill tell you a tale of the summer of 1994  a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie  and it was a whos who of the top canadian bands of the age  we got there about 4am  waited in line most of the morning  and when the doors opened at 9am  we were among the first inside the gates  we then waited and waited in the hot sun  slowly broiling but we didnt care  because the headliners were among our favourites  at one point  early in the afternoon  i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier  i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t shirt  this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day  theres nothing reasonable  nor taste determined  nor really anything except their fandom  snotty of me  isnt it  so  i  in my hatred of the band  have denied myself the delight that is whale music  desmond howl had it all  its hard to say what hes lost  since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains  the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking   the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams  phantoms  and his own past  until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in   and  trite as it sounds  breaks him out  canadian cinema suffers from several problems  generally  a lack of money  as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help  as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian  leads to lower production values than american or british films  and most people dont like to watch anything that sounds or looks like  well  not like an american film  next  canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story  and tell it well  third  they seem to think that gratuitous nudity  often full frontal  makes something artistic  im sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies  especially late at night on the cbc  knows exactly what im talking about  its almost like a  dont do this  handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film makers threw it out a long time ago  in the 90s and 00s  however  some films  such as bruce mcdonalds work and the brilliant c r a z y   have broken this mold  and managed to maintain what makes them canadian  while holding onto watchable production values and great stories  whale music is such a film  on the surface  deeper than just its canadian isms  its a deeply moving story of a man whos lost his grip  through grief and excess  who is redeemed by music then by love  and that redeems even the rheostatics    
"I saw this important intense film tonight. Its Richard Gere and Claire's Dane's most important and best work. Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex offender registrar administrator. Claire Danes is riveting as the woman Gere handpicks to replace him - a woman he tries to teach all he can while investigating one final case in which Gere's character is convinced one of those he is charged to monitor may be holding a young girl hostage. The subject matter is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this film will not soon be forgotten. I know I will be haunted by Gere's portrayal for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins portrayal of a serial killer has a screen portrayal terrified and so engaged me. The film opens with a shocking statistic so don't miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. Richard Gere's finest role proving the man can act. Danes can as well and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film.<br /><br />This is a gutsy film and Gere gives a multi-layered deeply felt performance.

"I'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional state, but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy. A truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow (=Oswald) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team.<br /><br />The screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie.",1,im not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made  the story takes place in a fictional state  but obviously it deals with the murder of kennedy  a truthful and honest district attorney  played by yves montand  does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man daslow   oswald  and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team  the screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end  just the part dealing with the milgram experiment about authorities is  though not uninteresting  a bit out of place  the ending sequence   explaining who icarus really is   partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence i have ever seen in a movie 
"To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses that barrier. It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory.

Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman.

"Currently, this film is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst film ever made--which is exactly why I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am saddened to report that the film, while bad, is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list. I have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one. Hardly a glowing endorsement, but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list.<br /><br />The film begin with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their belated honeymoon (by the way, they are married in real life as well). He's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (hallmark of a bad film) and are soon bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the US--both of which are not true at all.<br /><br />Oddly, after being bitten, the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital!! The first thing on anyone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but not this boob. Soon, he's having seizures--yet he STILL isn't interested in seeking help! Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history!! <br /><br />After a while, he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But, by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood. When it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to believe he's dangerous--even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road!! <br /><br />Now most of the time Moss is going through these episodes, his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person. Oddly, however, a couple times he develops bat-like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat-like. Had this been really cheesy, the film would have merited a 1.<br /><br />In the very end, in a twist that hardly made any sense at all, the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff. How all this was arranged was a mystery as was Moss' and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers--though they both have had reasonably long careers on TV playing bit roles since 1974.<br /><br />Overall, very dumb. The plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real. Not a good film at all, but not among the worst films of all time either.<br /><br />NOTE: For some reason, IMDb shows the graphic for the three DVD set for IT'S ALIVE and it's two sequels of the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE has been seen with the title ""It's Alive"", the two movies are not at all related. It's easy to understand the mistake--especially since they both came out in 1974, but the movie I just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.",0,currently  this film is listed on imdb as the 42nd worst film ever made  which is exactly why i rented it from netflix  however  i am saddened to report that the film  while bad  is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list  i have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one  hardly a glowing endorsement  but it just didnt meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list  the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon  by the way  they are married in real life as well   hes a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave  once there  they behave very  very  very stupidly  hallmark of a bad film  and are soon bitten by a bat  according to this film  bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the us  both of which are not true at all  oddly  after being bitten  the man doesnt even bother going to the hospital   the first thing on anyones mind  especially a doctor  is to get medical help immediately  but not this boob  soon  hes having seizures  yet he still isnt interested in seeking help  again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history    after a while  he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital  but  by then its too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood  when its totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine  the wife  who  like her husband  has a grapefruit for a brain  refuses to believe hes dangerous  even after he attacks people  steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road    now most of the time moss is going through these episodes  his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person  oddly  however  a couple times he develops bat like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat like  had this been really cheesy  the film would have merited a 1  in the very end  in a twist that hardly made any sense at all  the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff  how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss and mcandrews belief that this film would somehow help their careers  though they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974  overall  very dumb  the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real  not a good film at all  but not among the worst films of all time either  note  for some reason  imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for its alive and its two sequels of the web page for the bat people  while the bat people has been seen with the title  its alive   the two movies are not at all related  its easy to understand the mistake  especially since they both came out in 1974  but the movie i just reviewed starred stewart moss and marianne mcandrew and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell 
"Is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television (or the media in general) as the 1960s? No. And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time? Not really. But if we must have one, does it have to be as shallow as ""The '60s""? <br /><br />I like to think that co-writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted, especially given Couturie's involvement in the superb HBO movie ""Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam"" which utilized little original music and no original footage, letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves. This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production, but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time; like so many of its ilk, it's seen from the point of view of one family. But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s (it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont), making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade.<br /><br />The makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children's father is especially clichéd - and then when they're back on BLAMMO! it's something else. Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. In fairness, Jerry O'Connell, Jordana Brewster, Jeremy Sisto, Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try, but they're wasted (especially the latter two); it's undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton, and Rosanna Arquette (in an uncredited cameo in part 2) is always welcome.<br /><br />What isn't welcome is how ""The '60s"" drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect (and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles, no Rolling Stones... then again, there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?). Capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending, ""American Dreams"" and ""The Wonder Years"" did it all much, much better.

"Bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this. Shore Leave is really TOS' first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which they would later perfect with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). It gave both the crew of the Enterprise and its TV viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of, for example, The Corbomite Manouever.<br /><br />Looking for a place to chill out for a while, the Enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic M Class planet, and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look. Soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly perilous - but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery (McCoy has gone through the looking glass), psychological thriller (Kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past), and romantic comedy (no comment).<br /><br />TOS was the least serialized of all of the series in the Trek franchise, so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy-handed, potentially calamitous drama. Unlike later series franchise writers, TOS' production team was not afraid to literally go where no TV series had gone before. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly Shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on ST's themes.

"Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.<br /><br />Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.<br /><br />Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.",0,of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list  devil hunter  bloody moon and women behind bars  this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety  being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore  a gratuitous rape scene  and loads of nudity  gorgeous blonde ursula buchfellner plays movie star laura crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the devil god that lurks in the jungle  a big  naked  bulging eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices   employed by lauras agent to deliver a  6million ransom  brave mercenary peter weston  al cliver  and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island  but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double cross  during the confusion  laura escapes into the jungle  but runs straight into the arms of the islands natives  who offer her up to their god  franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks  crap gore  murky cinematography  rapid zooms  numerous crotch shots  out of focus imagery  awful sound effects  and ham fisted editing  the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish  it took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing   and even the sight of the luscious buchfellner in all of her natural glory aint enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry 
"Unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as actors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better.<br /><br />The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. Disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended.<br /><br />There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the end.<br /><br />Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.",0,unfortunately  this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original  nicholas cage  fairly wooden as far as actors go  imbues the screen with a range of skill from  non plussed to over the top  the supporting cast is no better  the plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse  not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold  it turns out its just a bill of poor goods  disbelief cannot be suspended  nor can a befit of a doubt be given  the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual  as the medium requires  and whomever scouted the location should be commended  there was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos  literally  at the end  disappointed  wait for the original to come on television  pour a whiskey and enjoy 
"I had the privilege to see this movie at the Intenational Film Festival of Rotterdam.<br /><br />'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $200.000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons. The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local, mostly aged men, come to relax and to go bathing. The father has to sons: a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him. To this son the traditional village, the bathhouse and his 'retarded' brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes along the movie.<br /><br />Though the story may sound cheesy or cliche, it's not. With really great performances, especially of the father and the 'retarded' son (sorry, I don't know their names) and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time.<br /><br />If you got a chance to see this movie do it. It's a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood cinema.<br /><br />",1,i had the privilege to see this movie at the intenational film festival of rotterdam  xizhao or shower is a  200 000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons  the father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional chinese village where local  mostly aged men  come to relax and to go bathing  the father has to sons  a retarded son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him  to this son the traditional village  the bathhouse and his retarded brother seem strange and annoying  but this changes along the movie  though the story may sound cheesy or cliche  its not  with really great performances  especially of the father and the retarded son  sorry  i dont know their names  and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time  if you got a chance to see this movie do it  its a great alternative to mainstream hollywood cinema 
"There was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she's always wanted after the worst life possible, beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and this utterly destroys it in the end. It sounds weird, but I like the position Dean Cain was in at the end and the choice he made. He can't hurt her because he loves her and she's the mother of his child (I think the time frame makes it clear it's his child and not his brother's), but at the same he can't forgive her for all she's done, sleeping with his brother (which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way) and then being part of his death. In better hands this would have been a better movie, but for something I caught on late night cable, it's not bad.",0,there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life shes always wanted after the worst life possible  beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with eric roberts  but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end  it sounds weird  but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made  he cant hurt her because he loves her and shes the mother of his child  i think the time frame makes it clear its his child and not his brothers   but at the same he cant forgive her for all shes done  sleeping with his brother  which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way  and then being part of his death  in better hands this would have been a better movie  but for something i caught on late night cable  its not bad 
"Predictable, told a thousand times story with the usual drama in between, a couple of pretty raunchy sex scenes intermingled with some character paranoia, 70's style incidental violin horror music that is comical at times, i couldn't help chuckling to myself.<br /><br />I usually like Defoe, and it has to be said that the acting is not all that bad, the ""plot"" develops at a reasonable pace and does keep you guessing from time to time. Its just that it's all too predictable, i felt like i was watching a made for TV drama instead of a new movie. Maybe thats the style the directors wanted, but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production.<br /><br />Don't expect too much, and if i could wind the clock back i wouldn't have gone to see it at the cinema.

"I bought a DVD of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie was shot entirely on video, so it has the look of a PBS special about it. The special effects are phoney looking, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat. There is a particularly effective scare involving a Virgin Mary statue.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the ""plot"" scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you I have no clue what happened at the end.

"I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the U.S.A.) and felt afterward that it was, indeed, a truly awful movie. But they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film, or I missed a lot. The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I've read several other comments on IMDb.com mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon. I did not see anything like that, just a bad, boring film with unlikable characters and a trite, sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills, and nary an expression touches her face. And her name makes me think of super-sizing a beverage at Taco Bell: ""I'll have the Cola Grande!""

"A chance encounter between a salesman and a hit-man changes both their lives. This is an odd film that works, an impressive effort for writer-director Shepard. In a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit-man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job, but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope. Kinnear is equally good as the salesman, a decent fellow with a void in his life. Davis is fine as Kinnear's flirtatious wife. Mainly a character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.",1,a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit man changes both their lives  this is an odd film that works  an impressive effort for writer director shepard  in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond  brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job  but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope  kinnear is equally good as the salesman  a decent fellow with a void in his life  davis is fine as kinnears flirtatious wife  mainly a character study  the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable  an extremely dark comedy 
"Julia Stiles is a talented young actress, who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential. Obviously, the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career. I sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone. It was poorly written, the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care.",0,julia stiles is a talented young actress  who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential  obviously  the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career  i sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone  it was poorly written  the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didnt care 
"Thank God this wasn't based on a true story, because what a story it is. Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren't carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.<br /><br />The story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: ""Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery"", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from Albert Finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you've got a Shakespearean/Greek tragedy on your hands.

"I would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand I was fully able to understand it for what it is.. A very incoherent attempt at a plot line.<br /><br />I don't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well. The director firstly presents the material in an extremely ""arrogant"" way and worse, extremely incoherently. It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to CARE by the end of it.<br /><br />I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life) But there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times, and a modern day earth setting, that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore, simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together. The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was based on a book, but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.<br /><br />Let's compare stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe's ""Seul contre tous"" to this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. This movie offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it's fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.<br /><br />Yes indeed it IS possible to make sense of things.... to a POINT. But as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say ""Who cares."" It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order. Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. Too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish, and in every way this film TRIES to make the viewer look foolish.<br /><br />If you have too much time on your hands, then please watch this film, taking into account what I have said of it. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning.",0,i would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand i was fully able to understand it for what it is   a very incoherent attempt at a plot line  i dont like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well  the director firstly presents the material in an extremely  arrogant  way and worse  extremely incoherently  it is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order  making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first  and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us  the viewer to care by the end of it  i respect surrealist cinema for what it is   creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life  but there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times  and a modern day earth setting  that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore  simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together  the most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story  perhaps even a very good story as it was based on a book  but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesnt seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence  lets compare stylistic cinema  compare gaspar noes  seul contre tous  to this  he gave us a coherent  extremely engaging and intellectually deep story  this movie offers no intellectual study  and while it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation  the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together  yes indeed it is possible to make sense of things     to a point  but as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say  who cares   it plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order  even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging  too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish  and in every way this film tries to make the viewer look foolish  if you have too much time on your hands  then please watch this film  taking into account what i have said of it  it is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning

"First let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan melts into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond. It also shows his range and depth as an actor. It is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well crafted. The twist in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters come off realistically. So many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking-stereotypes... I like the different approaches this movie takes. I think of sideways when I think of this movie but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall...",1,first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots  i really enjoyed them  i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan  greg kinear is pretty lackluster  brosnan melts into this character so well  that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond  it also shows his range and depth as an actor  it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year  i found the characters to be well crafted  the twist in the middle i felt was especially good  i also liked how the characters come off realistically  so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking stereotypes    i like the different approaches this movie takes  i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall   
"This romantic comedy isn't too bad. There are some funny things happening here and there, and there are some rather memorable characters in it.<br /><br />The acting, however, is amateurish (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are great fun, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the ""romantic"" part of the story poor. <br /><br />All in all, I guess it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies.

"In September 2003 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a film, first broadcast in March, that was an uplifting, confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. Not shying away from the grim reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked about documentary of that year. It attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to Jonny's charity, DEBRA. A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that Jonny Kennedy left a one million pound legacy.",1,in september 2003 36 year old jonny kennedy died  he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  eb    which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch  leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer  in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death  and the result was a film  first broadcast in march  that was an uplifting  confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man  not shying away from the grim reality of eb  the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full  produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year  it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonnys charity  debra  a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy 
"This thrown together piece of fecal matter adds together so many ludicrous scenarios that in the end it's a laugh riot of absolute hilarity. Too bad as the premise is promising (as it so often is in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter it segues off into la la land. <br /><br />Lowe is in Prison serving time for a DUI that killed off his mistress. We get to see him having nightmares just so that we know he feels real BAD about this. Then his cell mate neighbor hangs himself. Or does he? Lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly. His suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. So why do they then set him up to be killed? Ah, that's where this story could get interesting.

"OK - the Cons first: The obligatory '70's alligator (all right, correction - caiman) with nonmoving limbs is made the worse for scale miniature underwater shots (with the full length of reptile comparative to the size of the boat) utilizing a toy alligator being swirled around the toy boat in broadly lit water - even for nighttime shots!<br /><br />Unlike most primitives-killing-exploitative-Westerners films, the superstitious natives going bat**** and start massacring the vacationers seems unjustified this time. No one really abused the natives - exploited, yes, but far from abusive treatment. After all it was one of the natives (canoodling with a spoiled supermodel during a taboo full moon) that brought the curse of the River Demon on them, right?<br /><br />The vacationers are easily annoying (with the notable exception of the token old-soul/mildly blasphemous-little-girl-who-takes-a-shine-to-the-heroes that you often see in 70's Euroflicks), but far from from deserving violent death - unless they were your next door neighbors, mind you. A couple actually get killed being heroic - notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick. There are only two straight villains in the entire film, so the demises feel more arbitrary than cathartic.<br /><br />The sequence where the giant caiman crunches down and scarfs thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably strike you as unintentionally hilarious.<br /><br />The point at which the natives decide not to wipe the surviving Westerners and practically saying ""hey, you aren't so bad after all, sorry about that fuss last night"" - because they blew up the monster lizard - has you shaking your head as the corny music kicks in. You know, the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for ****ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll...<br /><br />The Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You ALL know WHY you're interested in this film in the first place, right? I thought so. If you're a Bach completist, get the DVD reissued by NoShame films earlier this year (digitally remastered with no real extras to speak of, aside from the director bemoaning the current state of international film distribution).<br /><br />The hero isn't half bad, being far from an idiot (always a plus in B films) and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief.<br /><br />Worth a look, but get it cheaply!",0,ok   the cons first  the obligatory 70s alligator  all right  correction   caiman  with nonmoving limbs is made the worse for scale miniature underwater shots  with the full length of reptile comparative to the size of the boat  utilizing a toy alligator being swirled around the toy boat in broadly lit water   even for nighttime shots  unlike most primitives killing exploitative westerners films  the superstitious natives going bat     and start massacring the vacationers seems unjustified this time  no one really abused the natives   exploited  yes  but far from abusive treatment  after all it was one of the natives  canoodling with a spoiled supermodel during a taboo full moon  that brought the curse of the river demon on them  right  the vacationers are easily annoying  with the notable exception of the token old soul mildly blasphemous little girl who takes a shine to the heroes that you often see in 70s euroflicks   but far from from deserving violent death   unless they were your next door neighbors  mind you  a couple actually get killed being heroic   notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick  there are only two straight villains in the entire film  so the demises feel more arbitrary than cathartic  the sequence where the giant caiman crunches down and scarfs thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably strike you as unintentionally hilarious  the point at which the natives decide not to wipe the surviving westerners and practically saying  hey  you arent so bad after all  sorry about that fuss last night    because they blew up the monster lizard   has you shaking your head as the corny music kicks in  you know  the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for     ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll    the pros  barbara bach  barbara bach  barbara bach  barbara bach  you all know why youre interested in this film in the first place  right  i thought so  if youre a bach completist  get the dvd reissued by noshame films earlier this year  digitally remastered with no real extras to speak of  aside from the director bemoaning the current state of international film distribution   the hero isnt half bad  being far from an idiot  always a plus in b films  and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief  worth a look  but get it cheaply 
"I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We were learning about space. All little kids want to go to space, right? Well, after I saw this, I was so scared to death that I would 'accidentally' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was some news program or something. I guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'War of the Worlds.' So, recently, I get this movie again to watch, realizing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? I don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.<br /><br />The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backwards as the security doors close. Little Max is trying to pull her in. Suddenly, we get a major close up on Max's face as he shouts (in slow motion) ""Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?""

"Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).<br /><br />It's out there for a quid.

"I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently. The sci fi channel has run worse, but not by much. A shameless ripoff of Jurassic Park, ATTACK substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are on the loose, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is pretty bad, and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable. We get some gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can get it.

"From it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances, Curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout. The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantino's name is attached to it, and the silly and out of place nod to the Rodriguez/Tarantino flick 'From Dusk till Dawn'. These things do not make a great movie, however, and this is more than evident all the way through 'Curdled'. The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas, and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing. The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool, but it's becomes annoying very quickly; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican, it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie. The film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who, because of her obsession with grisly murders, takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes. It sounds boring and it is.<br /><br />William Baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list, and even he doesn't make an impression. He hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing, he's pretty much wasted. Angela Jones, or rather; the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction, takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman, and it is always clear that it's her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role, not her acting ability. She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself. She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film, and if it weren't for her Latino accent; she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level. Curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash. Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics; but this one fails on all levels. Whether you're a Tarantino fan, William Baldwin fan, horror fan or just a movie buff; this is one to miss.",0,from its uninspiring title to the flat acting performances  curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout  the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantinos name is attached to it  and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez tarantino flick from dusk till dawn  these things do not make a great movie  however  and this is more than evident all the way through curdled  the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas  and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing  the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool  but its becomes annoying very quickly  especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican  it doesnt fit with the tone of the movie  the films plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who  because of her obsession with grisly murders  takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes  it sounds boring and it is  william baldwin is the only name on the cast list  and even he doesnt make an impression  he hasnt been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing  hes pretty much wasted  angela jones  or rather  the taxi driver from pulp fiction  takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman  and it is always clear that its her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role  not her acting ability  she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantinos masterpiece  but she doesnt have the talent to lead a film by herself  she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film  and if it werent for her latino accent  she wouldnt convince the audience that shes a weirdo on any level  curdled is a one hundred percent proof piece of forgettable trash  films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics  but this one fails on all levels  whether youre a tarantino fan  william baldwin fan  horror fan or just a movie buff  this is one to miss 
"There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. However, for that reason the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family or what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it only hints at both. While this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers.",0,there is a lot to like here  the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit  likable family  however  for that reason the film does not ring true  we see leo  who apparently just learned of his hiv positive diagnosis  essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself  as well  the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo  his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him  the young actor who plays leos brother  marcel  is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast  unfortunately  the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of hiv on a functional  appealing family or what the devastation hiv is on the victim   so it only hints at both  while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers 
"This is a great movie. I love it more each time i watch. Most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a pleasure. This is pitch perfect ensemble acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H.

"My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed Southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD. The first season was must-see TV for us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching.<br /><br />My husband and I were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up. But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. Why would a strong, middle aged woman do those things? The answer is she wouldn't. Additionally, my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family. Can't the script writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers.

"I realize several Ben Stiller movies are out or will be out this year, but perhaps he should insist on quality, not quantity.<br /><br />I was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in ""Along Came Polly."" <br /><br />Stiller's Reuben is grating, charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick is getting tiresome. He undoubtedly has comic talent, but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break, find some material that is actually funny. Because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.<br /><br />There's absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she's a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she keeps making more movies such as ""The Good Girl"" (in which she's terrific) and less like ""Along Came Polly,"" she'll have a career of which she could be proud.<br /><br />Aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working, but it's a daunting task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, as Reuben's boss Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben's best friend Sandy, there's nothing funny in this awful film. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's accent is not only stupid, it's terribly unfunny.<br /><br />The premise of ""Along Came Polly"" certainly showed promise.

"'The Curse of Frankenstein' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley's story for one word of the title, which wouldn't be so bad if the changes were any good at all. The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein's family has been completely excised and replaced with... nothing. The heart and moral centre of the story is gone. It doesn't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving, devious murderer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichés.

"Yuck. I thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written. The acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times. Why would a ""demonico"" kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for the heck of it? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle whenever she's out somewhere. We get it! You spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket. It doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! The ""Faith's"" lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance. Everyone is a throwaway character.

"So what's the big fuss out of making an INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor who's cast as a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who doesn't want to go out on an adventure??? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for whatever reasons possible, this movie greatly lacks in excitement! That doesn't mean it has no action, but look on the dark side of the picture. This has got to bare no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action-adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it!

"What is with all of the European (especially England) comments here? All i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great.

I can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood films with real actors in them. For what it's worth, Men in White is a very stupid-funny mock of a movie.

"I do not believe all the praise for this movie. The play and movie were a ripoff of Sleuth. Michael Caine wishes he were Olivier, and Reeves wishes he were Caine. Caine even had the nerve to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part. Jude Law? You mean the one that did the remake of ""Alfie""? <br /><br />This movie was made during a period of Caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would star in such award winning movies such as this, and ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"". What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is Reeves death. He deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in the $5.97 bin at Walmart.

"Ritchie's first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. Here, he raids two recent classics  'The Usual Suspects' and 'Fight Club'  and still comes out empty-handed.<br /><br />Despite parading itself as a con-mystery (with the sub-'Usual Suspects' twaddle ""the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you"" or whatever it was...) and attempting a 'Fight-Club' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. By the last third, you know you're being lead down a blind alley, and tediously slowly at that.<br /><br />Cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) watchable is Ritchie's bold way with with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there's no reason why he couldn't have made another enjoyable gangster caper.<br /><br />As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility does not equal profundity. If you want to see a great film that doesn't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch 'Lost Highway'.",0,ritchies first two films were snappy  stylish entertainment  here  he raids two recent classics  the usual suspects and fight club  and still comes out empty handed  despite parading itself as a con mystery  with the sub usual suspects twaddle  the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you  or whatever it was     and attempting a fight club twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations  the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half  by the last third  you know youre being lead down a blind alley  and tediously slowly at that  cons  chess and game theory are all great subjects  but ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material  the only thing that keeps the movie  almost  watchable is ritchies bold way with with a scene and maurice joness dynamic camera  if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot  and succumbed to tighter editing  theres no reason why he couldnt have made another enjoyable gangster caper  as it is  revolver is a waste of your time  incomprehensibility does not equal profundity  if you want to see a great film that doesnt make logical sense but makes a virtue of it  and  incidentally  which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement  watch lost highway 
"Its about time that Gunga Din is released on DVD. I cannot accurately say how many times I have watched this fine film but, I never tire of it. The lead actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team.<br /><br />I just cannot get over their exploits in India. Your first glimpse at the Sergeants Three, is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called treasure Map. The three Sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town- or so they think.<br /><br />They engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few ""residents"" in hiding. Soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base.<br /><br />Later they are sent on another mission which gives Sgt Cutter a chance to go hunting for the Gold with Din. They find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil Kali supporters. Din is sent to fetch help and Cutter gets captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din, and they are too captured.<br /><br />Faced with being killed, they watch helplessly as their Regiment comes to rescue them. The evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded Din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the British to the ambush. In doing this, Din is shot dead.<br /><br />The Soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them.

"The brilliant thing about Withnail & I is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15/16. I know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in Cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in Hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in the forest of Dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days (had some great mates - hate to think what they're all up to now - probably running the local council). I've watched it a couple of times on DVD and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection (how can i like this film and the Dambusters - doesn't seem right somehow) I certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done. I like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity. I have tried to obtain the soundtrack, but it has not been released (shame, as it's a corker). Someone told me it was originally a stage play, not quite sure how that worked but i'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearian touches/references that seem to crop up throughout the film (also spotted the Dylan Thomas ref as well) and like all little gems, there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to Easyrider as they start they're next journey. All in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making (love it!)",1,the brilliant thing about withnail   i is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery  freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15 16  i know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it  i grew up in the forest of dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days  had some great mates   hate to think what theyre all up to now   probably running the local council   ive watched it a couple of times on dvd and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection  how can i like this film and the dambusters   doesnt seem right somehow  i certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done  i like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity  i have tried to obtain the soundtrack  but it has not been released  shame  as its a corker   someone told me it was originally a stage play  not quite sure how that worked but im sure it was fun  i liked the little shakespearian touches references that seem to crop up throughout the film  also spotted the dylan thomas ref as well  and like all little gems  there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to easyrider as they start theyre next journey  all in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making  love it  
"Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story don't work and i felt its not Agatha's mistake. The cast isn't good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. The story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?!

"How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. Now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it.<br /><br />Screenwriters Jeffery Price & Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story to full life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show.<br /><br />Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story. Having read the original story, I must say I cannot agree. The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed, it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was.<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS* (They probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know NOTHING about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.)<br /><br />I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences in school. I think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on. I know I was... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through.<br /><br />And Cindy Lou Who's naive idealism, believing that nobody can be all bad, was heart rending. When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude.<br /><br />In fact, I think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content. It was already pretty restrained, but any of this adult humor (like when The Grinch slammed nose first into Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit in a story like this.<br /><br />This one's well on its way to being a Christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season.",1,how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing  now  eight viewings later  it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw it  screenwriters jeffery price   peter s  seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen  ron howards direction brought the story to full life  and jim carreys typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the show  some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story  having read the original story  i must say i cannot agree  the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story  indeed  it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he was   mild spoilers   they probably wouldnt ruin the movie for you    but if you havent seen it yet and youre one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until youve seen it  you should skip the next two paragraphs   i think just about everyone can relate to the grinchs terrible experiences in school  i think all of us  at one time or another  were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on  i know i was    and thats why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went through  and cindy lou whos naive idealism  believing that nobody can be all bad  was heart rending  when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance  cindy lou was determined to be his friend  if only everyone could have such an attitude  in fact  i think the only thing that mightve made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content  it was already pretty restrained  but any of this adult humor  like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whoviers cleavage  just doesnt fit in a story like this  this ones well on its way to being a christmas classic  taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a must see of every christmas season

"Extremely thin 'plot' of satanic rituals or some such mumbo-jumbo provides the hokey excuse to thread copious amounts of sex scenes together. Straight vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S&M, bestiality, incest, and a few other sexual proliferation's all get their time in the spotlight here.

"I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel, and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released. Many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed ""master"" director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen. ""Salem's Lot"" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini-series, directed by Tobe Hooper (he of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" fame) and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a ""Chiller Theatre"" vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick's stature would succeed where Hooper had failed. It didn't happen.<br /><br />Sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, it's all downhill. Jack Nicholson cannot be anything but Jack Nicholson. He's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here. I don't care that many reviewers here think he's all that in this clinker, the ""Here's Johnny!"" bit notwithstanding...he's just awful in this movie. So is everyone else, for that matter. Scatman Crothers' character, Dick Halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest ""shock"" sequences ever put on film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. King's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically. Kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom.<br /><br />This movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond me.",0,i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel  and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released  many reviewers out there arent old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king  the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed  master  director put this multi layered supernatural story on the screen   salems lot  had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini series  directed by tobe hooper  he of  texas chainsaw massacre  fame  and was badly handled  turning the major villain of the book into a  chiller theatre  vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise  fans hoped that a director of kubricks stature would succeed where hooper had failed  it didnt happen  sure  this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments  its all downhill  jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson  hes always crazy and didnt bring anything to his role here  i dont care that many reviewers here think hes all that in this clinker  the  heres johnny   bit notwithstanding   hes just awful in this movie  so is everyone else  for that matter  scatman crothers character  dick halloran  was essential to the plot of the book  yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest  shock  sequences ever put on film  i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick  those that stayed that is   many left  kings books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters  and often metaphysically  kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately dont really care what happens to whom  this movie still stinks and why so many think its a horror masterpiece is beyond me

A great story a young Aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates, who are just as loveable and innocent as he is.<br /><br />It's chock a block full of great, sayings , where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he's as dry as a dead dingoes donger? great characters, top acting, and it's got great sheilas and more Fosters consumption then any other three films put together. Top notch.<br /><br />And some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear, and it's full of great celebrities.

"I have no idea how to describe this movie, and also would love to provide others the same opportunity I had - seeing it with no prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it immensely but can also say I barely understood what was going on, if in fact there was anything to understand in the first place. Fans of David Lynch (tangentially) or especially Guy Maddin films should particularly enjoy this, and any fans of the comic book EIGHTBALL will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder (it came as close as any film I've seen to the tone and mood Dan Clowes creates so effectively).<br /><br />One slight note just to warn anyone easily offended - this movie, if rated, would be NC-17 for sure. Fans of male full-frontal nudity, however...hmm, well...yes.

"As a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of BSG and the stand alone feature BSG Razor I was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. Usually I have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little CGI money spent. This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous & unbelievable. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that teens don't love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex & violence & heavy dance music. Its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth & reason or political & religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me. These kids are definitely not from this planet. The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. But this old concept was far better portrayed & much more believable in the brilliant, classic original ""Frankenstein"" with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film. No surprise there! Overall this movie was bland & unoriginal & cheap looking, using recycled CGI of Caprica from BSG. I doubt I'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless of course I happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure.

"What is really sad, shows like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are the true reality TV, not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows. I think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellation's of numerous shows with a cult following. But with the more vocal backlash the fans of Jericho (which I also enjoy) and other shows, networks may start to reverse this trend. I am like others, I will not support ANY new shows until they have been given a second season. I'll then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via DVD's and online viewing.

"When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects.There's one good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this film.<br /><br />My Grade: D+",0,when the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of california  i was wondering if i got the tapes mixed up  then i breathed a sigh of relief to see paul thomas in a scene with the lovely joanna storm and laurie smith  this is being spied on by jimmy  a young tom byron   jimmys aunt  honey wilder  is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher  kay parker   i could do without the animal  robot role playing  or the incest aspects theres one good sex scene  between byron and parker  but its not good enough to save this film  my grade  d 
"I am a Christian... and I feel this movie is awful.<br /><br />Nobody but hard-core, Bible-belt Christians are going to like this movie. The message is just too in your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be way more subtle. You can't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in EVERY scene. RIDICULOUS! <br /><br />Poor direction. The reveal of people missing should have been terrifying, but it was laughable. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies: ""Oh my God! People are missing!"" That scene in the plane is just stupid. Think about it: if you found your relative's clothes next to you, you wouldn't just scream ""oh my god. they disappeared! they're missing!"" and start crying and yelling. You would first be in denial... you just wouldn't jump to that conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. I about fell off the couch I was laughing so hard.<br /><br />The music was so bad and so distracting. It was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies. ""here's my chance to do a thriller"", ""here's my chance to do action!"" STOP TELLING ME HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL! A good score supports what's happening on the screen... this movie needed more of an UNDER score, but instead it was as much in your face as the message was.<br /><br />The writing was bland. So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was the worse: ""you don't understand! People are missing!"". Brad Johnson was laughable. The two stand out performances came from the Anti-Christ and the older guy (sorry, can't remember their names) In watching the ""making of"" (to answer my question of ""what were they thinking???""), the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves... saying ""we're gonna reach wide audiences"" and ""brad Johnson is amazing"" and ""this is just like a Hollywood movie"". I came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the ""heck"" they are doing.<br /><br />I commend the effort. Getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best medium possible to do that. Look at movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF Christ, even O'BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? The bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision.

"The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately that is all the positive I can say about this western movie. I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western. I am not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a spoof. The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. Not realistic at all. A lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. A previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at President Bush. This was not a democratic or republican western.

"This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at just how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are absolutely first grade level, as in any first grader could have done them. Toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign, and a laughable story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to ""Conquest"".

"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had extensive (separate) film careers before they were eventually teamed. For many of Ollie's pre-Stan films, he was billed on screen as Babe Hardy ... and throughout his adult life, Hardy was known to his friends as 'Babe'. While touring postwar Britain with Laurel in a music-hall act for Bernard Delfont, Hardy gave an interview to journalist John McCabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname: early in his acting career, Hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed Hardy's plump cheeks (the ones on his face) and said 'Nice baby!' Hardy's workmates started crying him 'Babe', and the nickname stuck.<br /><br />Although much of Hardy's pre-Laurel work is very interesting -- notably his comedy roles in support of Larry Semon and the Chaplin imitator Billy West -- his teamwork with Billy Ruge (who?) in a series of low-budget shorts for the Vim Comedy Film Company is very dire indeed. Hardy and Ruge were given the screen names Plump and Runt: names which are unpleasant in their own right, but made worse because Ruge (although shorter than Hardy) isn't especially a runt. Seen here, Hardy looks much as he does in his early Hal Roach films with Laurel ... but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache.<br /><br />'One Too Many', an absolutely typical Plunt and Runt epic, is direly unfunny ... and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as 'That's My Wife', one of Laurel and Hardy's most hilarious films. Plump (Hardy) is the star boarder in a rooming-house run by a tall gawky landlady. Runt (Ruge) is the porter. Plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle John, whose dosh he expects to inherit. His uncle is coming to see him and to meet Plump's wife and baby. There's only one problem: Plump hasn't got a wife and baby. He's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man. Now, of course, Plump expects Runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice. Of course, the results are disastrous. It would be nice if those disastrous results were funny, but they aren't. Most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick, with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs.<br /><br />SPOILERS COMING. Vim director Will Louis (who?) shows no instinct for camera framing: the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than Hardy, and Louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame. This could be funny if done on purpose, but it's merely inept. At one point in this bad comedy, an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as Runt approaches a black laundress. 'Surely they wouldn't stoop THAT low for a laugh,' I thought. But they do. Runt steals the woman's black infant and tries to fob this off as Plump's progeny.<br /><br />Somehow, Plump acquires an infant's cot, but he still hasn't got a baby. With Uncle John coming up the stairs, Plump conscripts Runt for babyhood. This gag might just possibly have worked with a midget, or even with a truly runt-sized actor such as Chester Conklin, but Billy Ruge is only slightly below average height. Ruge's impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny, and Uncle John would have to be a complete moron to fall for it. Amazingly, he does!<br /><br />The most notable aspect of 'One Too Many' is a brief appearance -- apparently her only-ever film appearance -- by Madelyn Saloshin, Oliver Hardy's first wife. The marriage was not a happy one, although Hardy's marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of Stan Laurel's. <br /><br />Only one thing in this movie impressed me. There is a very brief flashback sequence, with Hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty. In 1916, there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks: the one shown here is done gracefully and simply. Too bad this movie has no other merits. 'One Too Many' is definitely one film too many on Oliver Hardy's CV, and I'll rate this movie just one point out of 10. Laurel and Hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately.",0,stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive  separate  film careers before they were eventually teamed  for many of ollies pre stan films  he was billed on screen as babe hardy     and throughout his adult life  hardy was known to his friends as babe  while touring postwar britain with laurel in a music hall act for bernard delfont  hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname  early in his acting career  hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardys plump cheeks  the ones on his face  and said nice baby  hardys workmates started crying him babe  and the nickname stuck  although much of hardys pre laurel work is very interesting    notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west    his teamwork with billy ruge  who   in a series of low budget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed  hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt  names which are unpleasant in their own right  but made worse because ruge  although shorter than hardy  isnt especially a runt  seen here  hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel     but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache  one too many  an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic  is direly unfunny     and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as thats my wife  one of laurel and hardys most hilarious films  plump  hardy  is the star boarder in a rooming house run by a tall gawky landlady  runt  ruge  is the porter  plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john  whose dosh he expects to inherit  his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plumps wife and baby  theres only one problem  plump hasnt got a wife and baby  hes been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man  now  of course  plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice  of course  the results are disastrous  it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny  but they arent  most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick  with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs  spoilers coming  vim director will louis  who   shows no instinct for camera framing  the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy  and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame  this could be funny if done on purpose  but its merely inept  at one point in this bad comedy  an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress  surely they wouldnt stoop that low for a laugh  i thought  but they do  runt steals the womans black infant and tries to fob this off as plumps progeny  somehow  plump acquires an infants cot  but he still hasnt got a baby  with uncle john coming up the stairs  plump conscripts runt for babyhood  this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget  or even with a truly runt sized actor such as chester conklin  but billy ruge is only slightly below average height  ruges impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny  and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it  amazingly  he does  the most notable aspect of one too many is a brief appearance    apparently her only ever film appearance    by madelyn saloshin  oliver hardys first wife  the marriage was not a happy one  although hardys marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurels   only one thing in this movie impressed me  there is a very brief flashback sequence  with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty  in 1916  there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks  the one shown here is done gracefully and simply  too bad this movie has no other merits  one too many is definitely one film too many on oliver hardys cv  and ill rate this movie just one point out of 10  laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately 
"Bette Davis' electrifying performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players. They were as perfect in their parts as Davis was in hers - they just didn't have as much to do. Some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better - it was but to give the film it's due, to condense a 600 page book down to 83 minutes is no mean feat. The first part of the book didn't even make it to the screen - it told of Phillip's childhood, then moved to Germany and Paris, where Phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist. It also chronicles his first romance - with Fanny Price, who kills herself when she realises Phillip cannot return her feelings of love. It is a wonderful book but rambling and I think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is.<br /><br />After realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter, Phillip Carey (Leslie Howard) comes back to England hoping to take up medicine. When out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress, Mildred (Bette Davis). Even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt, Phillip is obsessed. It is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew. In one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room, when they almost miss each other, she berates him with ""why would I wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available"". You just want to shake him. The only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man, a coarse sales- man, Emile Miller (Alan Hale). With Mildred out of the picture, he meets Nora (Kay Johnson) a lovely woman, who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym. She jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants (in the novel he had seen Mildred reading them.) Nora gives Phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love. When Mildred returns (Miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby), of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby (in the film it is treated as an object - always called ""baby"", never given a name or gender) - she repays him by running off with his best friend.<br /><br />At the hospital he meets Sally Athelny (Frances Dee) who is visiting her sick father. He begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family. Then surprise! surprise! Mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise! Philip takes her in. But he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how. Then follows one of the most vicious, verbal fights on film with phrases such as ""you cad, you dirty swine"", ""I only kissed you because you begged me"" and ""when you went I wiped my mouth, I WIPED MY MOUTH""!!! In the book a lot of Mildred's stock phrases such as ""you're a gentleman in every sense of the word"", ""I don't mind"", and ""Mr. High and Mighty"" were associated with prostitutes and when Phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that.<br /><br />The end of the film shows Phillip (being truly free of Mildred in the only way possible) now free to love Sally. Again in the book Sally tells Phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love. That ending, like Mildred's ""sickness"" could not be in the film - even a pre-code one.<br /><br />Kay Johnson was always called on to play sensible, believable women - which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself. Her Nora was the woman Philip should have stayed with. Frances Dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues. She was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face (""The Silver Cord"" and ""Blood Money"") but when she married Joel McCrea her career started to peter out. Her Sally did not push her talent to the limits. Apparently Leslie Howard was not very helpful to Bette Davis on the set - he was annoyed that an English actress was not given the part. He used to throw her her lines ""whilst reading a book off camera"".

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This is without a doubt the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. Film starts out with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer/prostitute in a club that caters to American GI's and she meets a black Army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they start to see one another on a steady basis. Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill. But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door. He hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so Maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out. The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. She tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her. Hermann gets out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get over everything that Maria has done since he has been locked up.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />One day Karl dies and leaves Maria just about everything in his will and Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they're marriage even though they have been married for some time now. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it.<br /><br />There are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths. Like in all Fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn Germany but as Maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white. The rebuilding of Germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of Maria. Fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla wasn't nominated for an Academy Award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether Maria purposely left the gas on. Later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad. This is only speculation and if you think I'm wrong please e-mail me. I think she was overly excited by Hermann being home and left it on by accident (Remember her putting on a dress for no reason?). Then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing. Thats the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes its by accident. But I think the reason for Fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate. In his view Maria can't have it both ways. A fascinating film.,1,   spoilers       spoilers    this is without a doubt the best film rainer werner fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by hanna schygulla  film starts out with maria  schygulla  and hermann braun  klaus lowitsch  just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive  maria decides to get a job as a dancer prostitute in a club that caters to american gis and she meets a black army soldier named bill  greg eagles  and they start to see one another on a steady basis  maria hears that her husband hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with bill  but one day while getting intimate with bill they see hermann at the door  he hasnt died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and maria breaks a bottle over bills head and he dies  hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out  the war has ended and germany must rebuild and one day on a train maria meets karl oswald  ivan desny  who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job  maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes karls mistress  she tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her  hermann gets out of jail but goes to canada to try and get over everything that maria has done since he has been locked up       spoiler alert      one day karl dies and leaves maria just about everything in his will and maria buys her own house  then hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start theyre marriage even though they have been married for some time now  but maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it  there are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths  like in all fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way  as the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn germany but as maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white  the rebuilding of germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of maria  fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in germany at that time  hanna schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film  with a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status  schygulla shows maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants  shes not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and fassbinder wanted to show maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive  schygulla wasnt nominated for an academy award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time  fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother lilo pempeit plays frau ehmke  i have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether maria purposely left the gas on  later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad  this is only speculation and if you think im wrong please e mail me  i think she was overly excited by hermann being home and left it on by accident  remember her putting on a dress for no reason    then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that hermann and karl had become friendly without her knowledge and i think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing  thats the reason for the bathroom scene  so when the house explodes its by accident  but i think the reason for fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living  fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate  in his view maria cant have it both ways  a fascinating film

"Unfortunately, this has been showing on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week or so. It's complete rubbish acting. As another member said, this movie is a good example of 'how not to act.' I haven't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is, you would have to see the movie... but that would be akin to torture.<br /><br />I cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or contrived) is equally heinous. Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. Mix that with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. She should just have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. Oh my, we just got to the scene where the leading lady's lover says ""Really me?"" after a forced crying scene from her. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed out loud.<br /><br />The sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice (minus the actors).<br /><br />The old magic potion lady? What?! Another member mentioned the 'modern' love song that was in the movie. Totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago.<br /><br />I understand the movie was considered 'Big Budget' in Thailand at the time of it's production. I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this movie. Just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film.<br /><br />I would give the King Maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating. 2 out of 10.",0,unfortunately  this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so  its complete rubbish acting  as another member said  this movie is a good example of how not to act  i havent seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time  the actors  can you call them actors   are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog  i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is  you would have to see the movie    but that would be akin to torture  i cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines  and the rest of the cast with their accents  fake or contrived  is equally heinous  another actress with the fake british accent was pretty  yes  but good lord was her accent terrible  mix that with her  lack of  acting and you have a disaster  she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl  oh my  we just got to the scene where the leading ladys lover says  really me   after a forced crying scene from her  laughable  no  really  i just laughed out loud  the sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film  some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice  minus the actors   the old magic potion lady  what   another member mentioned the modern love song that was in the movie  totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago  i understand the movie was considered big budget in thailand at the time of its production  i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie  just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good  or even mediocre  film  i would give the king maker a 1 out of 10  but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating  2 out of 10 
"Bollywood fans pretty much hold Amitabh Bachan's Mard in high regard but I think it is very overrated. Manmohan Desai collaborated before on movies like Suhaag,Parvarish,Amar Akbar Anthony,Naseeb,Desh Premee and Coolie and I have seen all of them I liked so I had very high expectations before I watched Mard and was bitterly disappointed. My main gripe about Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2,maybe Mr Desai ran out of ideas, after all he had been using that formula for years and years. 1. First of all some members of the cast is repeated from AAA, for instance the police inspector who brings up Amar, the Muslim who brings up Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few more. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses her eyesight, in Mard she loses her voice 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba)well in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. Having seen AAA for over 1000 times I noticed that straight away.<br /><br />My other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last gripe is that compared to songs in previous Manmohan Desai movies I found the songs rather disappointing. I know it has many fans that swear by it but I didn't like it one bit. It actually pains me to write this review because I am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since I was a child.",0,bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachans mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated  manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag parvarish amar akbar anthony naseeb desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed  my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part 2 maybe mr desai ran out of ideas  after all he had been using that formula for years and years  1  first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa  for instance the police inspector who brings up amar  the muslim who brings up akbar  nirupa roy and a few more  2  in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight  in mard she loses her voice 3  in aaa there is the famous song  shirdi wale sai baba well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali  having seen aaa for over 1000 times i noticed that straight away  my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous  true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far  my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing  i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didnt like it one bit  it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child 
"Omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever, ever seen. To say that i love horror movies would be an understatement, and i have seen heaps (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before have i had to sleep with the light on...until i saw The Grudge.<br /><br />Some may say that it is a rip off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (yet different) story lines, but the Grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema, i even screamed at a certain point in the movie.<br /><br />The acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he is having fun. However, while i am normally a fan of Clea DuVall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie. Of the supporting characters, hers probably got the most depth and back story, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she? The ghosts were genuinely scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (particularly the noise being made when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the ending was cool too.<br /><br />Super highly recommended. 9/10",1,omigosh  this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever  ever seen  to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement  and i have seen heaps  considering the limited availability in new zealand  thats quite a lot   but never before have i had to sleep with the light on   until i saw the grudge  some may say that it is a rip off of the ring  both based on japanese horror movies   both similar  yet different  story lines  but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie   seeing at at the cinema  i even screamed at a certain point in the movie  the acting is great  particularly from the supporting characters   kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show  she is such an enthusiastic person  jason behr is a real hottie  and william mapother looks like he is having fun  however  while i am normally a fan of clea duvalls  she doesnt really seem into this movie  of the supporting characters  hers probably got the most depth and back story  but she doesnt seem like she is all there  as for sarah michelle gellar  well  she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesnt she  the ghosts were genuinely scary  the music and sound effects were chilling  particularly the noise being made when kadee stricklands character answered the phone in her apartment   the ending was cool too  super highly recommended  9 10
"This western is done in a different manner than most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. How this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of Americana. I would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape, but it's worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excel in this movie.",1,this western is done in a different manner than most others  realism is the key here  conchata farrell comes to wyoming to work for rip torn on his ranch  how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of americana  i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape  but its worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west  cinematography is excellent  solid 9  torn   farrell excel in this movie 
"Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the Law and Order ADA's and her acting is even worse here. Her attempts at a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed, as if she can't remember where she left her keys.<br /><br />This is an important true story, so it's too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they just can't overcome Rohm's tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a Southern drawl whenever actual acting is required.",0,elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law and order adas and her acting is even worse here  her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic  nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child  at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed  as if she cant remember where she left her keys  this is an important true story  so its too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message  the rest of the cast is talented enough  but they just cant overcome rohms tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever actual acting is required

"I had some expectation for the movie, since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /><br />When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well, the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.<br /><br />The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.<br /><br />Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10.<br /><br />Guys, please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie.

"Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the gang at SNL set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level. Fortunately Chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe. It seriously is very, very bad. While meant to be a political comment on USA at the time of it's release (1974) it still remains neither funny or acutely observed. The sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom.

If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red. I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white. If you don't you will never be able to get through the film.

"Before I'd seen this, I had seen some pretty bad Christmas films. But once I saw this, ""Jingle All the Way"" looked better than ""The Godfather"". ""Santa Claus"" is a jolly film about Santa helping out some kids, but it almost feels demonic watching it. Santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil, devilish laugh that I'm sure has turned many kids off of Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits along with all of the performances and dialog. Santa lives high above Earth in the North Pole where he, and kids from all around the world get ready for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa's Christmas by making three boys naughty, and by creating diversions, like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, it's up to Santa's helper Pedro and Merlin the wizard to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /><br />Everything about this film, along with being downright bad, is so bizarre. Satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than Santa. Santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls, yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in Mexico. The reindeer are wind up toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm amazed it doesn't bring tears to kid's eyes...it's frightening. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa playing the organ while kids sing to it. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting Pitch in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing about it while Pitch dances around in pain. I think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from, than showing them this. The only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB/****. 85 mins.",0,before id seen this  i had seen some pretty bad christmas films  but once i saw this   jingle all the way  looked better than  the godfather    santa claus  is a jolly film about santa helping out some kids  but it almost feels demonic watching it  santas jolly ho ho ho is replaces by an evil  devilish laugh that im sure has turned many kids off of christmas  the plot of this massacre is very strange  which fits along with all of the performances and dialog  santa lives high above earth in the north pole where he  and kids from all around the world get ready for christmas  but santa has an enemy named pitch  or satan  pitch tries to ruin santas christmas by making three boys naughty  and by creating diversions  like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot  when pitch causes santa to be attacked by a dog  its up to santas helper pedro and merlin the wizard to get santa out of this pickle   everything about this film  along with being downright bad  is so bizarre  satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than santa  santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls  yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in mexico  the reindeer are wind up toys  and when the reindeer laughs  im amazed it doesnt bring tears to kids eyes   its frightening  everything is terrible  the first 10 minutes are simply santa playing the organ while kids sing to it  probably one of the strangest scenes is santa shooting pitch in the butt with a mini cannon and uproariously laughing about it while pitch dances around in pain  i think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from  than showing them this  the only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema  my rating  bomb       85 mins 
"One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh features several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conducting, and much more. The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath, through transparent keys, and Grayson singing, seen through the finder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you get involved from Kelly's & Sinatra's enthusiasm. Sailor's on leave, they have to take home a runaway boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls for his aunt. To set him up with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra's young and naive in this one, and in his own sung words falls in love too fast. While they're trying to contact Iturbi, who's never available, he starts to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly's now falling love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live-action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there's a lot more here that's worth a look. I'm giving it nine stars because, while it's not quite as good as the best musicals - Singin' In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - it is one of the first of their class of Technicolor big productions (perhaps Meet Me In St. Louis was the first), and better than most others.",1,one of the first of the best musicals  anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences  such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse  kelly dancing with 7 year old sharon mcmanus  sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano  kathryn grayson singing with iturbi conducting  and much more  the technicolor is perfect  with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath  through transparent keys  and grayson singing  seen through the finder of another camera  the plot is thin  but you get involved from kellys   sinatras enthusiasm  sailors on leave  they have to take home a runaway boy  dean stockwell  and sinatra falls for his aunt  to set him up with the aunt  grayson   kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi  but sinatras young and naive in this one  and in his own sung words falls in love too fast  while theyre trying to contact iturbi  whos never available  he starts to fall for another girl  barbara britton   but kellys now falling love with grayson  anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live action   cartoon sequence with tom and jerry  but theres a lot more here thats worth a look  im giving it nine stars because  while its not quite as good as the best musicals   singin in the rain  the music man  oklahoma   it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions  perhaps meet me in st  louis was the first   and better than most others 
"This has to be the WORST movie ever!!! The acting is scarier than the movie. Lots of blood, but no idea where it comes from, cuz they don't even show you the cuts. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a disgrace to horror films!!! For one if they are in Asia why is there a white cop driving past Waste Management trash cans?! There's so much of another language that you don't even know what's going on half the time.

"OK, so I rented this clown-like-Chainsaw-Massacre-esquire film, not expected much, but I did like the novel approach to a serial killer film. (from the back of the box is the following synopsis) ""At first, it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the Texas woods. But when they began to disappear one-by-one, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives. But he's out there. And he's sick. And all he wants is blood..."" So obviously from the get-go it doesn't make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with? Why a clown? Why are their dolls with the word ""food"" drawn on them? Why why why? Hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min. bore fest except where this clown lives. The characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness. One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin? She, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear.<br /><br />The music was an average affair (standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences). The actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. There was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $1-store dolls lying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie (been done too many times). I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film. I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something.<br /><br />I had to give the film a 3. It was an interesting premise (clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially) and I'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a B-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video. But ultimately, I probably would've felt like renting the Killer Klowns from Mars video again before going back to check this out.

"How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. ""Gymkata"" is a ridiculous action movie, filled (or is that empty?) with paper-thin plots, dumb characters, and preposterous situations. But take it from me, if you enjoy watching poor, yet goofy, movies, you will enjoy ""Gymkata"" a great deal.<br /><br />The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see his dad was another quasi-government agent, who has gone missing competing in this game, called, eloquently, ""The Game."" So the gymnast (played blandly by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad.<br /><br />Sounds promising doesn't it? Okay, so it doesn't but still, that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie. They can be found in the movie's strange details. Like the gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend, who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie, then all of a sudden begins to talk, and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time! Or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break ""The Game""'s non-existent rules whenever he so pleases. And of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the ""Village of The Crazies"" (Evidently that's the place's real name!). Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.<br /><br />But where this movie really shines is the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of Middle Eastern cities, so that our Gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses. It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />One interesting thing of note. A lot, I'd say about half the cast, dies from being shot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie. If these were indeed effects, my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds. More likely, this was the film's way of not paying extras. Nevertheless, ""Gymkata"" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing.<br /><br />",0,how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k ill never know   gymkata  is a ridiculous action movie  filled  or is that empty   with paper thin plots  dumb characters  and preposterous situations  but take it from me  if you enjoy watching poor  yet goofy  movies  you will enjoy  gymkata  a great deal  the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents  at least i think they were government agents  to become a spy  you see his dad was another quasi government agent  who has gone missing competing in this game  called  eloquently   the game   so the gymnast  played blandly by kurt thomas  trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad  sounds promising doesnt it  okay  so it doesnt but still  that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesnt begin to describe the joys of this movie  they can be found in the movies strange details  like the gymnasts mysterious asian girlfriend  who doesnt speak for the first half hour of the movie  then all of a sudden begins to talk  and doesnt shut up for the rest of the time  or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break  the game s non existent rules whenever he so pleases  and of course theres our heros delightful romp through the  village of the crazies   evidently thats the places real name    nice place to visit  but i wouldnt want to live there  but where this movie really shines is the action scenes  since our protagonist is a gymnast  the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities  so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses  it has to be seen to be believed  one interesting thing of note  a lot  id say about half the cast  dies from being shot with an arrow  interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie  if these were indeed effects  my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds  more likely  this was the films way of not paying extras  nevertheless   gymkata  deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing 
"I first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally, through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man.<br /><br />Particularly moving was the Funeral of Steve Biko, made even more vivid and hard-hitting by the South African Anthem played at the time. I have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed - to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in South Africa. I consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and I can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just South Africa, but how we as white people perceive black people. I have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed, but after viewing this film I physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible. The greatest reward I can honestly say I have received - to be able to say that in my own small way I have contributed and redressed the balance a little. But if more people thought like me and actually DID something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off.<br /><br />I challenge any right thinking person to watch Cry Freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in Sharpville for refusing to learn Afrikaans, the senseless murder of Steve Biko, such a champion for his own people's rights, and then, ultimately, to understand that all this is not merely a film, albeit a magnificent one, but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago.<br /><br />Yes, my friends, watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard. I couldn't. I was too upset at knowing the truth. That is the hallmark of a great film. It was obviously the intention of Sir Richard Attenborough to get this message over about South Africa. Of course he has achieved it. Unless you happen to support apartheid.

"This is the second Baby Burlesk short to be released, and probably the most popular one, is a spoof of the 1926 silent film What Price Glory.<br /><br />I watched this and I do not understand the kiddie-porn that is being claimed. It is just a cute little film. I have seen family shows that I grew up watching in the '80's and '90's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a 'mature manner'. It was more provocative because they WEREN'T dressed in diapers. There's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes. (just a joke) I read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this. That is sick. To me, if you watch this and are bothered by it, then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you. It is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film. All of the B.B. films were parodies, nothing more. The parodies/spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language. Shouldn't those be more appalling? I can watch those without issue, but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies. That is what should get under your skin. Not that they babified (not a word, I know) an adult movie from 1926, because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC those silent films were, huh? Not to mention those 'Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Code era films' so vile and filthy. They would NEVER make such filth today?

I have watched the series many times and am still enthralled.<br /><br />Just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of ""Cracker"".

"The Matador is a witty, dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from Pierce Brosnan, who has never ever been better than here, and the always reliable Greg Kinnear who has his best role here since playing Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor in As Good As It Gets. A big plus goes to the writing as well. Clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by Brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way. The story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next.<br /><br />Nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music, clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film.

"As a long time Red Sox fan, I just had to go see the movie. It was great! While there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 Red Sox season, there were great shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the movie is certainly a chick flick, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans that were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious! A must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse, date, or significant other...especially if you are a baseball fan...and even more especially if you are Red Sox fan!!!",1,as a long time red sox fan  i just had to go see the movie  it was great  while there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 red sox season  there were great shots of some of my favorite red sox players  while the movie is certainly a chick flick  it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 red sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time  i especially enjoyed the red sox fans that were part of bens baseball family  the scene where ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious  a must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse  date  or significant other   especially if you are a baseball fan   and even more especially if you are red sox fan   
"This is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change. As usual the lovers--Sally Field as almost-over-the-hill soap opera queen, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson--are working at cross purposes, seemingly unaware that they are madly in love, etc. Owing a little to Bette Davis's Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950) and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition, Sally Field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the more underrated leading men of recent years, is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome, vulnerable, egotistical and lovable all at the same time.<br /><br />The misadventures center around Celeste's fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties, and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece, aspiring actress Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue) who turns out NOT to be her niece, with ensuing plot complications. Cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to Celeste (and to Jeffrey Anderson as well)--but never mind.<br /><br />As a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are Robert Downey Jr. (soap opera director, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan). David Barnes is oh so hot for her, but she cares only about one thing: getting rid of Celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set. To this end she gets Barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck Celeste's career, but through happenstance and/or a perverse logic, all his attempts go awry, much to the delight of the viewer.<br /><br />Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show's chief writer and Celeste's alter-ego and confidant while Carrie Fisher has a modest part as the hard-as-nails producer of the show.<br /><br />I thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that I have seen (Young Doctors in Love 1982 which burlesqued TV's General Hospital and was pretty good). Soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh-out-loud one-liners and terrific performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. But see this for Sally Field who is outstanding.",1,this is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change  as usual the lovers  sally field as almost over the hill soap opera queen  celeste talbert  and kevin kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor  jeffrey anderson  are working at cross purposes  seemingly unaware that they are madly in love  etc  owing a little to bette daviss margo channing in all about eve  1950  and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition  sally field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness  kevin kline  one of the more underrated leading men of recent years  is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome  vulnerable  egotistical and lovable all at the same time  the misadventures center around celestes fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties  and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece  aspiring actress cori craven  elisabeth shue  who turns out not to be her niece  with ensuing plot complications  cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to celeste  and to jeffrey anderson as well   but never mind  as a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are robert downey jr   soap opera director  david barnes  and cathy moriarty  montana and nurse nan   david barnes is oh so hot for her  but she cares only about one thing  getting rid of celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set  to this end she gets barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck celestes career  but through happenstance and or a perverse logic  all his attempts go awry  much to the delight of the viewer  whoopie goldberg plays rose schwartz  the shows chief writer and celestes alter ego and confidant while carrie fisher has a modest part as the hard as nails producer of the show  i thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that i have seen  young doctors in love 1982 which burlesqued tvs general hospital and was pretty good   soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh out loud one liners and terrific performances by field  kline and downy  jr  but see this for sally field who is outstanding 
"This movie surprised me, it had good one-liners and laughs, + a nonstop action-packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions. This movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns. The plot is solid despite what others may think, it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end.

"I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's basically all the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.",0,im a big fan of italian films from the seventies  and i wouldnt hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time  so i did go into this film with some hopes  however  it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isnt going to go anywhere  clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more  but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that its also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting  as the title suggests  the film focuses on a rogue  in this case one that steals  womanises and smuggles stuff  thats basically all the plot that this movie has  the film does have a real seventies style to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well  it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point  although whatever that point is doesnt come across very well  seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure  and that is the case here too  shes definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film  overall  the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style  but unfortunately it doesnt have much else to offer 
"I think I've seen worse films, so I'm giving this a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been!! Possibly Xtro (nasty & dull) or possibly Creep (just plain dull), but it is a struggle to think of something worse. It's difficult to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor man's Under Siege, starring an even poorer man's Jean Claude Van Damme. The only redeeming feature was seeing Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know.<br /><br />Judging from this site, he's been stuck in TV movie hell.... Casper, be more selective.... please!!!!!!!!!!!!

"By God, it's been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago?<br /><br />The movie tells us (kids) all about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally put together--Disney-style animation, plus human actors--it was directed by Frank Capra, for pete's sake!<br /><br />Kind of an overkill. I wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film-strip's worth of information on the human body? But boy will those kids watching it learn: even now I can clearly remember Dr. Baxter being challenged by Hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood, to which the Doctor immediately answers ""sea water.""",1,by god  its been a long time since i saw this  probably about 18 years ago  the movie tells us  kids  all about human blood and the circulatory system  very professionally put together  disney style animation  plus human actors  it was directed by frank capra  for petes sake  kind of an overkill  i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film strips worth of information on the human body  but boy will those kids watching it learn  even now i can clearly remember dr  baxter being challenged by hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood  to which the doctor immediately answers  sea water  
"I am very disappointed with ""K-911."" The original ""good"" quality of ""K-9"" doesn't exist any more. This is more like a sitcom!

"Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can't remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10.

"As far as the Muppet line goes, however, this is not the best, nor the second best. This was marketed towards the kiddies, but has some dark, and emotionally upsetting adult moments, to which parents may not wish to expose their children. One of which showcases Miss Piggy going ""postal"" in a jealous rage, which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work.<br /><br />Beyond that, however, the story is progressive, and highly entertaining. One scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious! And there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun.<br /><br />I like this very much, and enjoy it still today.<br /><br />It rates a 7.6/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.",1,as far as the muppet line goes  however  this is not the best  nor the second best  this was marketed towards the kiddies  but has some dark  and emotionally upsetting adult moments  to which parents may not wish to expose their children  one of which showcases miss piggy going  postal  in a jealous rage  which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work  beyond that  however  the story is progressive  and highly entertaining  one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious  and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun  i like this very much  and enjoy it still today  it rates a 7 6 10 from    the fiend   
"Dear Friends and Family,<br /><br />I guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen, then that's their eternal damnation - just remember kids, ""birth control"" doesn't mean ""oral sex"", I don't care what the honor student says.

If she was my sister, I'd eat this guys kneecaps.<br /><br />Other than that I found out that Mongolians don't kiss the same way the French do and that baseball players named Zoo like delicate undergarments.<br /><br />I think I'd almost rather watch Richie Rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip, slap, slop.

"Vincente Minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history... He was among the first Hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color, motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment... <br /><br />'American in Paris' is the story of an ex-GI who remains in France after the war to study and paint... He falls in love with a charming gamine Lise Bourvier... Their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the City of Lights itself... The whole movie brings a touch of French elegance where technique, artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism...<br /><br />The first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of Leslie Caron in her screen debut... She is like a diamond, a touch of class... George Guetary describes his fiancée ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles, sweet and shy, vivacious and modern, graceful and awesome... The number leads to an unpretentious bistro, where Kelly and his very good friends in Paris share a gentle parody of Viennese waltzes... Later Kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him 'I Got Rhythm,' and at the massive jazz nightclub Kelly spots the girl of his dreams... He is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes, and only one clear thing is in his mind, to pull Lize onto the dance floor and sing to her: ""It's very clear, Our love is here to stay.""<br /><br />To the joyful 'Tra-La-La,' Kelly provides humor, wit and talent all around Oscar Levant's room ,and even on the top of his brown piano... <br /><br />When he meets his pretty Cinderella along the Seine river, Kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with Caron... He expresses all his emotions with 'Our Love Is Here to Stay.' The piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft, blue smoky light... They start an enchanting dance-duet juxtaposing differing elements... Caron dances with her head on his shoulder, then tries to run away in a fluid way... They move backward, away from each other, then pause to rush toward each other, for a little kiss, and a warm hug...<br /><br />The film's weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story... In one, Georges Guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage... In another, Oscar Levant imagines himself conducting a concert, and playing not only a piano recital, but the other instruments as well... He even applauds to himself as members of the audience...<br /><br />The extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure, a breakthrough in taste, direction and design... It is a blaze of love, fury and vividness... It is Kelly's major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about Paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of France's most Impressionist painters...<br /><br />The number starts at the Beaux Arts Ball after Kelly finds himself separated from Lise, and begins a sketch with a black crayon... It gathers the important parts of the film's story through a constantly changing locations, all in the style of the painters who have influenced Jerry... The tour, richly attractive and superbly atmospheric, includes the Place De la Concorde Fountain, the Madeleine flower market, the Place De l'Opéra, to his Rendez-Vous at Montmartre, with the cancan dancers in a representation of Lautrec's Moulin Rouge...<br /><br />Kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self... Caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place...<br /><br />Nina Foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one-shouldered white gown... In one of the film's most famous lines, Kelly asks her: 'That's quite a dress you almost have on. What holds it up?"" Nina, cleverly replies, ""modesty!""<br /><br />'An American in Paris' garnered six Oscars, including an honorary award to Gene Kelly...

"OK, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good. The music I could have done without (not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit this film at all).<br /><br />As for the content of the film, the director brings up the often-lacking Pagan perspective on Christ's existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life vs. the lives of mythological figures/deities such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he brings up the chronology of Christianity's origins and presents an 'ok' case, but not one that blew me away.<br /><br />If the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them, this film would have been good. However, at this point in the film, it disintegrates into a group of personally-gratifying attacks on Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" and a Christian private school which the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his old principal, (which during the course of, it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses) I felt that the director was acting sort of childish. He was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school's rules, not Christianity.<br /><br />All in all, if you're just interested in some info, watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off.",0,ok  aside from the psychedelic background imagery  the info presented here was good  the music i could have done without  not that it was bad music  just that it didnt fit this film at all   as for the content of the film  the director brings up the often lacking pagan perspective on christs existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of christs life vs  the lives of mythological figures deities such as mithra and dionyses  then he brings up the chronology of christianitys origins and presents an ok case  but not one that blew me away  if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them  this film would have been good  however  at this point in the film  it disintegrates into a group of personally gratifying attacks on mel gibsons  passion of the christ  and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth  during an interview with his old principal   which during the course of  it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses  i felt that the director was acting sort of childish  he was asking good questions but  like the film itself  the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private schools rules  not christianity  all in all  if youre just interested in some info  watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off 
"This is one of those movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you that warm, fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your face.<br /><br />Sure, we get fed the typical stereotype characters and stories, but it does do the trick: Entertain.<br /><br />Being from Sweden and living in the US for quite sometime, it is funny how we react. ""The deadbeat husband is going to kill him"", ""She (Gabriella) is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking larger-than-life ending"". We know how these things work, everything comes together at the end. And it did. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so elaborate that you didn't really think twice about it, nothing was really left for your own imagination. The closest would probably be Siv, she makes you ask yourself if she indeed was in love with Daniel, but that's about it.<br /><br />But the movie is beautiful, set in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable. Michael Nyqvist is truly genius, with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. Maybe a little too nice.<br /><br />But most of all this movie makes you feel, and that is the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify.

"Despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring Disney films I've seen, and I don't slam Disney films very often. Spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured, either by the cavalry or by Indians, both of which try to ""break"" him. Spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story. With exception to the beautiful animation of the horses, neither I or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film. It's ironic that it's titled ""Spirit"", as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of. An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this film is rated G, you will still probably have to end up explaining what ""breaking a horse"" means to your five year old.

"I know that in this episode there's other stuff apart from what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, the fact, after we had been given a very negative opinion of Jin from seeing Sun's flashbacks in ""House of the Rising Sun"", we get to see Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life.<br /><br />But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode. Before now, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it had been hinted that Sun's father was someone who was getting rich through shady, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was a mob boss, even; mobs operate in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode we learn that Sun's father is in fact the boss (or a top executive) of a Korean automotive company, and that what Jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official (who was actually going to be murdered) on his behalf.<br /><br />I may be especially touchy about this because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in Korea; that huge, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model for this fictitious car company, as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operate with these mafia-like methods, instead of like any normal automotive company of the West. it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story, and that there hasn't been an uproar in Korea over it. It feels like extraneous ""Buy American!"" propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminal, untrustworthy, third-world outfits.",0,i know that in this episode theres other stuff apart from what i am going to discuss  and in fact i think it has some virtues  for example  the fact  after we had been given a very negative opinion of jin from seeing suns flashbacks in  house of the rising sun   we get to see jins side of things and get a new  more balanced understanding of his life  but there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode  before now  in the scene where jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt  it had been hinted that suns father was someone who was getting rich through shady  illegal methods  i thought maybe he was a mob boss  even  mobs operate in korea  just like in almost every other country in the world  so it was a reasonable possibility  however  in this episode we learn that suns father is in fact the boss  or a top executive  of a korean automotive company  and that what jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official  who was actually going to be murdered  on his behalf  i may be especially touchy about this because i happen to work in the automotive industry  but i would say it is spectacularly offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in korea  that huge  serious companies like hyundai or kia  which must be the model for this fictitious car company  as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality  operate with these mafia like methods  instead of like any normal automotive company of the west  it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story  and that there hasnt been an uproar in korea over it  it feels like extraneous  buy american   propaganda  portraying foreign car companies as criminal  untrustworthy  third world outfits 
"I don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played Othello, but I've never witnessed a performance of the play, on film or on stage, wherein Othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity.<br /><br />According to the biographical notes, Fishburne never received any professional training as an actor. Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. Instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles, Fishburne's portrayal is focused more on Othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. In a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by Fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been.<br /><br />The acting throughout is superb, and the (abridged) speeches gain grace from their light editing.

"I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Granted, it's Shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not. But this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not, that may prevent many from just not caring about a Shakespeare based story.<br /><br />The largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often during character's interacting, it's nearly difficult to distinguish who's lines are who's. Granted, I believe this movie is dubbed in English. Certainly they could've obtained voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic, literary lines.<br /><br />It would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1, although perhaps that's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget. Still, it's absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10",0,i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie  granted  its shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not  but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not  that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story  the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters  often during characters interacting  its nearly difficult to distinguish whos lines are whos  granted  i believe this movie is dubbed in english  certainly they couldve obtained voice actors which couldve added a bit more drama to these classic  literary lines  it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1  although perhaps thats based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget  still  its absolutely painful and boring  if you insist on hamlet  do yourself a favor and read the book again  1 10
"Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens.

"where would one start a review of the film Snitch'd? James Cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since Encino Man. his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop McClure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking, and discovers a gang war to rival that of Police Academy 1, and i mean the one where Jones is racially vilified by his new partner, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will EVER HEAR.<br /><br />Cahill's grasp of effects, both visual and aural is electrifying, the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd, a real gritty like underground thriller. also, kudos to his brilliant use of makeup, such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue! YUCK! i feel the world of film is much less from James' passing, his memory will linger on and on and on, reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, Snitch'd. his insightful director's commentary released a coke-hit up the nose of any discerning film goer, truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets, captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl.<br /><br />but i ask you, why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap? i'll tell you why, because thats life in Santa Ana baby, its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices, oh no. there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft, tattooed underbelly of street life in LA to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a School For Special Children's production of Double Dragon: The Play.<br /><br />the only qualm i have with this film, is that there was never a sequel made. come on Steven Spielberg, come on George Lucas, come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23, how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man, James Cahill.<br /><br />he discovered Eva Longoria you know. oh yeah, that he did.<br /><br />Jonah",1,where would one start a review of the film snitchd  james cahill  god rest his soul  made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man  his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure  which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor  said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking  and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1  and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner  but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear  cahills grasp of effects  both visual and aural is electrifying  the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitchd  a real gritty like underground thriller  also  kudos to his brilliant use of makeup  such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue  yuck  i feel the world of film is much less from james passing  his memory will linger on and on and on  reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production  snitchd  his insightful directors commentary released a coke hit up the nose of any discerning film goer  truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets  captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl  but i ask you  why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap  ill tell you why  because thats life in santa ana baby  its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principles offices  oh no  there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft  tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special childrens production of double dragon  the play  the only qualm i have with this film  is that there was never a sequel made  come on steven spielberg  come on george lucas  come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23  how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man  james cahill  he discovered eva longoria you know  oh yeah  that he did  jonah
"I can't add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here - great acting, balanced writing, multi-faceted characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, great commentary on millennial American life. The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tony's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh's interesting history as an outsider muscling in, Ralphie's total irredeemable viciousness, Chris' dual desires in life, and so on.<br /><br />I have to dig into some of the criticisms however, especially the 'it glorifies violence/belittles Italian-Americans' one.Most of the writers and actors are Italian-American, would they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef, Dr. Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos. Indeed, Dr Melfi's ex-husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of Italian-Americans have ever had Mob connections (certainly smaller than the proportion of African-Americans involved in crime, dare I say it. In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes).<br /><br />Most of the characters don't really choose the life they have; family background or circumstances largely corner them into it. Outsiders (even of Italian stock) who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2, for example. If you criticise this show, I assume Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist, or Will & Grace made you want to go homosexual? Presumably you won't listen to rap music that discusses gangs, or r'n'b which discusses promiscuity, or rock music which discusses drugs (or any other combination)? People aren't as stupid as some of you make out....<br /><br />Not everything is perfect however. A lot of characters have only appeared once, when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's ladyfriend (supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1).",1,i cant add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here   great acting  balanced writing  multi faceted characters  a great anti hero in tony  great commentary on millennial american life  the integral use of psychiatry coupled with tonys mother issues are especially fresh and humorous  several other characters add a lot of depth   heshs interesting history as an outsider muscling in  ralphies total irredeemable viciousness  chris dual desires in life  and so on  i have to dig into some of the criticisms however  especially the it glorifies violence belittles italian americans one most of the writers and actors are italian american  would they attack themselves  there are several positive italian american characters   artie bucco the chef  dr  melfi and her family and the cusamanos next door to the sopranos  indeed  dr melfis ex husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of italian americans have ever had mob connections  certainly smaller than the proportion of african americans involved in crime  dare i say it  in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes   most of the characters dont really choose the life they have  family background or circumstances largely corner them into it  outsiders  even of italian stock  who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends   matthew and his friend in season 2  for example  if you criticise this show  i assume frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist  or will   grace made you want to go homosexual  presumably you wont listen to rap music that discusses gangs  or rnb which discusses promiscuity  or rock music which discusses drugs  or any other combination   people arent as stupid as some of you make out     not everything is perfect however  a lot of characters have only appeared once  when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes   tracee the dancer  meadows friend ally  uncle juniors ladyfriend  supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1  
"A hint I think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread.<br /><br />I was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it ""mandatory"" or ""compulsory"".<br /><br />I think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing.<br /><br />The Global Warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to ""do right"". It appeals particularly to more ""liberal"" leaning people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to ""be good"" going.<br /><br />And that's the problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one at that. He just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would. The political appeal is just too great.<br /><br />And there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance, reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to ""do right"".<br /><br />Another interesting question is how did the Environmental movement get hijacked by such people?",0,a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread  i was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it  mandatory  or  compulsory   i think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing  the global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to  do right   it appeals particularly to more  liberal  leaning people because it doesnt have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to  be good  going  and thats the problem with the film  al gore is a politician  and a very successful one at that  he just cant help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would  the political appeal is just too great  and there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance  reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to  do right   another interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people 
"To say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks. As the other commenter says, this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 (it is especially, incredibly insulting to gays). It is awful - and not in a ""so bad it's funny"" sort of way either - it's just plain awful. No, I have to say it: IT STINKS! (sorry skunks).<br /><br />From the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for. The ""plot"" is incoherent, the characterization non-existent, the acting is of the over the top mugging ""look at me I'm being funny!"" school and so it goes on. The set pieces are clumsily set up (if at all) and are badly executed, it's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe, I don't remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs).<br /><br />To be fair to the makers, they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title ""Also starring Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor"" (since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted Ms. Kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: ""...and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus."" Uranus - ""Your Anus"" geddit? geddit? huh? huh?? Your Anus? The humour really is that cheap.<br /><br />It says strange things about the ""comedies"" of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say ""sh*t"" out loud.<br /><br />I paid fifty pence (about $1.00) for this movie in a sale.

"Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Let's get right to it: This is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh*t on it. It's just an awful movie. It's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film. What's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf. Kane f*cking Hodder. Someone's trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his film career...<br /><br />Anyway, former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf, too. It's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it. But it does have moments of near-rampant nudity. But that's about all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black blur zipping around the screen. And when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence, we're presented with something that resembles a full-motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation.

"As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah!<br /><br />Theology-wise, puh-leeze!!! God is still made to look and think like humans...and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. Being the lightweight comedy it is, it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /><br />There are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, audiences - from Christians to atheists.- got something out of this besides a few laughs, such as what prayer should really be all about.

"Annie's wig does not look good. she is not cute and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie sticks out in the movie, as her outfits look like Halloween costumes. terrible acting and terrible plots. This movie is such a change from the 1982 version. I think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role. Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie. Not appealing at all.

"I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as ""The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen"".<br /><br />Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it. I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film.<br /><br />The simple answer is - they didn't. Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative. Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them.<br /><br />I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from. But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened.<br /><br />They even change the true meaning of the books title ""Rancid Aluminium"" by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title.<br /><br />A real mess of a film from start to finish.",0,i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as  the worst film i have ever seen   even if you ignore the dodgy accents  low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it  i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film  the simple answer is   they didnt  characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative  even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches its climax you dont care what happens to any of them  i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from  but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened  they even change the true meaning of the books title  rancid aluminium  by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title  a real mess of a film from start to finish 
"Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon,when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun. I mean,the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness! It was the first movie I watched with this theme(drugs/marijuana) that is not really criticizing it,only making jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow,who lives in a small town in U.K. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide since he was full of debts. The problem is that Grace, who imagined to have some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things, specially her house that she loves so much. She never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until Matthew,her gardener who is very found of smoking pot, decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale.",1,saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun  i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness  it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana  that is not really criticizing it only making jokes about it  grace trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in u k  and has many financial problems because of her dead husband  who committed suicide since he was full of debts  the problem is that grace  who imagined to have some money saved for her  discovers that she needs to pay all of her husbands pounds in debts to not lose all of her things  specially her house that she loves so much  she never worked before  and is in a tragic situation until matthew her gardener who is very found of smoking pot  decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale 
"The best film about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids. The real intrusion or help of 'friends' -or executioner if we leave-. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. The mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality. A couple who thinks in a 'special' marriage, live a painful story in their future own history.<br /><br />Who likes contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells their own history if they leave the future in another hands, if they don't know WHAT is the marriage. That the problems are true, that the life demand a real engage, guaranties, from each one. That the real victims of the divorce are kids, with real name Andrea in the film- or names. That the abortion is only an easy exit: sadness, regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion. That the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families. The gossip of the 'friends', the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone.<br /><br />Maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the deep of their hearts, they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, Why they like marriage? A truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple: of each one of their decisions, of each one actions in their lives. The family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her, only by existing. The screenplay is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, ¡the almost cynical priest! An excellent direction and script.

"You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A sappy, trite verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks.

I liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage. It is very clean you can see it with family. Very nicely done. Songs are OK too. I think the writer director is great. The movie shows how marriages progress thru time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogs are quite good. The movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization. Also shows perfect is after all not so perfect. Shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The movie is very well written and directed.,1,i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage  it is very clean you can see it with family  very nicely done  songs are ok too  i think the writer director is great  the movie shows how marriages progress thru time  they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story  some of the dialogs are quite good  the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization  also shows perfect is after all not so perfect  shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new  the movie is very well written and directed 
"This 1953 Sam Fuller movie contains some of his best work, and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major Hollywood studios to do his stuff. The story line goes something like this. A tough hard broad (read prostitute) is riding the subway one hot summer day, and gets her pocketbook picked by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and the dame) don't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies. This opening shot without dialogue, and mostly in tight close-ups is a beaut,one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the movie. Playing the babe known as Candy is Jean Peters, who was never better nor better looking. One forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well. The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark, and set his style with 1947's Kiss Of Death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh, and although he's a little ""softer"" here, he's still scary. These hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty all the way. The standout performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter,who plays Moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral. Ritter received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost out to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as the B girl (read prostitute) in ""From Here To Eternity."" Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves to Oscar them even though their performance is usually awful. See for instance Shirley Jones in ""Elmer Gantry. Set among the docks and dives of New York City, with crisp black and white photography by the great Joe MacDonald,and some very good art direction. Especially good is the set representing the New York City subways and Widmark's shack near the river. Made at the height of the cold war and red scare, the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie, played by Richard Kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal American.",1,this 1953 sam fuller movie contains some of his best work  and its sad that he couldnt continue to get the backing of major hollywood studios to do his stuff  the story line goes something like this  a tough hard broad  read prostitute  is riding the subway one hot summer day  and gets her pocketbook picked by skip mccoy  what skip  and the dame  dont realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies  this opening shot without dialogue  and mostly in tight close ups is a beaut one of the many that fuller uses throughout the movie  playing the babe known as candy is jean peters  who was never better nor better looking  one forgets how beautiful she was  and she handles this role very well  the pickpocket is played by richard widmark  who had already made his mark  and set his style with 1947s kiss of death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh  and although hes a little  softer  here  hes still scary  these hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there  but its noir and nasty all the way  the standout performance belongs to the wonderful thelma ritter who plays moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral  ritter received a well deserved oscar nomination for her performance  but lost out to the boring but popular performance of donna reed as the b girl  read prostitute  in  from here to eternity   hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad  and loves to oscar them even though their performance is usually awful  see for instance shirley jones in  elmer gantry  set among the docks and dives of new york city  with crisp black and white photography by the great joe macdonald and some very good art direction  especially good is the set representing the new york city subways and widmarks shack near the river  made at the height of the cold war and red scare  the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie  played by richard kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal american 
"Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney. That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br /><br />But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me. Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like? The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true. Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!

"The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. Basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters just ""showing up"" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I might add)? All in all it wasn't ""bad"". I rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.",0,the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story  but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable  basic elements such as character development were glossed over  at best  inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads  a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside  characters just  showing up  in the gardens during a stormy night  at very convenient times  i might add   all in all it wasnt  bad   i rated it a 4  based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott

"I have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it's awesome. But the only thing with it was that in the beginning, there was too much talk of who's going out with who. I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it. But on the official site, they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it. What's even happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a pretty good actress. She has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard from her since. I know for sure about Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for Accounting at RD Films.

"This superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely at home in the story that apparently was supplied by Billy Wilder. One would love to know more about how much he had to do with it, because it's an exceptionally clever variation on the sterile master/fertile servant tale - nearly an allegory of the entertainment industry, run by dried-up numskulls, but made into a vibrant world of art and play by an exploited underclass of nobodies and non-WASPs.

"This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was silly, all the way to the end. It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980's. I would have given it a one, but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile. I think the worst thing was the underwater scene's held off of the dock. The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were, and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air, this air tank would kind of appear. I would avoid this, unless there is nothing else on the shelf.

"Having heard so much about the 1990s Cracker series without seeing any of them, I looked forward to this eagerly. Surely the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /><br />The polemics, backed by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were overpowering. The production tried to be super-modern, but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated. Robbie Coltrane sleep-walked through the two hours, coming up with unexplained and unlikely ""insights"", and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots. As a result, the tension never built up and the next-to-final scene (no details for fear of spoilers) was as laughably bad a piece of TV drama as I have seen for a long time.<br /><br />No, I don't want to see any more of these, but I will go back to the DVDs of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation.",0,having heard so much about the 1990s cracker series without seeing any of them  i looked forward to this eagerly  surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong  how wrong i was   the polemics  backed by frequent  repetitive and violent flashbacks  were overpowering  the production tried to be super modern  but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated  robbie coltrane sleep walked through the two hours  coming up with unexplained and unlikely  insights   and the police were portrayed as one dimensional bumbling idiots  as a result  the tension never built up and the next to final scene  no details for fear of spoilers  was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long time  no  i dont want to see any more of these  but i will go back to the dvds of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation

"It's rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie (eg. Big Fat Greek wedding; Me, Myself & Irene). There were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably profane. All around, it was a cute movie with likable characters. I thought the ending was a little abrupt. It feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish. The acting left a little to be desired, but was made up for by the pace of the story. If I'd known it was a Farrelly brothers movie I would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it, but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie.

"The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' several times. Yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored, like they never happened. The lead character was irritating throughout the movie, and at one point my fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some genuinely spooky/scary moments, but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me. It's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser.",0,the potential was there  i saw creep and thought  oooh  this is getting interesting several times  yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored  like they never happened  the lead character was irritating throughout the movie  and at one point my fella and i both shouted that we wanted her to die  there are some genuinely spooky scary moments  but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me  its another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while  but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve  the one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy  but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know youre on to a loser 
"I saw this Documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat Cinema at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival.<br /><br />I absolutely was into it. I love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes. It is amazing set-design. The scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies.<br /><br />And the music is so nice.<br /><br />I rate this experience 9/10.<br /><br />* spoilers ahead *<br /><br />The Documentary tells about awesome Blues-men, with black-and-white old-looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. It is really amazing. But this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing I might dislike in this Documentary. It is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those Blues songs in a modern way. I didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome Blues songs.

"I have been watching this show since I was 14 and I've loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just plain funny! You will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and funnier everyday and my favorite part is when Benny always has her last comments on George after every punchline about his fat giant head.*laughs* I would laugh and I'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented,funny,spectacular. This is a cool-funny-family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy it--I did! And if you haven't watched it yet I suggest that you start watching because you wouldn't want to stop watching it. Even though there aren't anymore brand new episodes I still enjoy the re-runs. Still funny.

Arthur is middle aged rich 'kid' who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind. He likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he don't know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird).<br /><br />This is a damn funny film. I watched this film because a very famous Indian film 'Sharabee' is based on the character of Arthur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur' I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Its very corny at times. There are so many fantastic one liners in the film. Its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiancé's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'. Duddley Moore sure has some comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a 'small' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film. I don't know that actor. I don't think he did a great job but may be if I watched more of his work I may agree in future. Movie has some flat patches but not very long ones. looking forward to watch the sequel.,1,arthur is middle aged rich kid who drinks like a fish  arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind  he likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat  he spends money on people he dont know and finds everything funny  arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress liza minnelli  she looks really weird   this is a damn funny film  i watched this film because a very famous indian film sharabee is based on the character of arthur  although sharabee is definitely inspired by arthur i think they are two different films  arthur is just fun  its very corny at times  there are so many fantastic one liners in the film  its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments  my favorite scene is when arthur meets his fiancés father and he keeps talking about the moose  duddley moore sure has some comic timing  he is very good with words and body language  i loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a small country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions  john gielgud got an oscar for this film  i dont know that actor  i dont think he did a great job but may be if i watched more of his work i may agree in future  movie has some flat patches but not very long ones  looking forward to watch the sequel 
"Cecil B. deMille's 1922 parlor-to-prison tearjerker Manslaughter finds the lovely Leatrice Joy as a good-at-heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with. Her recklessness leads to imprisonment, which in turn leads to her regeneration. Thomas Meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in Lydia (Joy) but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released, it is up to her to rescue him!<br /><br />If the plot doesn't sound too bad, you'll be floored by the woeful presentation. The quality of deMille's direction is very low, and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him. The photography is standard and flat, and the editing is hardly more dynamic. One could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct. DeMille gets to dress Miss Joy up in so many different types of clothes (evening gowns, golfing costumes, motoring costumes, piles of furs) that it's subtitle could be 'Fashions of 1922'<br /><br />One thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting, which is mostly flat and wooden. When it is not, it is merely routine silent gesturing, rolling eye balls, twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements. What would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films, is here merely dull to watch. The only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is Lois Wilson, who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally. She is convincing and endearing in tearful close-ups, as long as you don't read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak. Like I said, everybody else is droningly routine, Joy, Meighan, even Julia Faye. Her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom.<br /><br />The worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it. Meighan's character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of America is declining in it's moral stance, and going right back to the decadence of Rome. (insert absurd flashback) This movie's moralizing has been described as Victorian, but it's further than that. It has so little bearing in reality that I have a feeling audiences at that time didn't take it any more seriously than modern viewers could.<br /><br />This movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a 'typical' silent movie, with it's archaic moral structure, wooden acting and bad direction. DeMille shows that he could be a terrible director, with no sense of pacing, camera placement, or skill in handling either script or actors. I can't imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously. Boring, slow and idiotic, I recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only.",0,cecil b  demilles 1922 parlor to prison tearjerker manslaughter finds the lovely leatrice joy as a good at heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with  her recklessness leads to imprisonment  which in turn leads to her regeneration  thomas meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in lydia  joy  but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released  it is up to her to rescue him  if the plot doesnt sound too bad  youll be floored by the woeful presentation  the quality of demilles direction is very low  and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him  the photography is standard and flat  and the editing is hardly more dynamic  one could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct  demille gets to dress miss joy up in so many different types of clothes  evening gowns  golfing costumes  motoring costumes  piles of furs  that its subtitle could be fashions of 1922 one thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting  which is mostly flat and wooden  when it is not  it is merely routine silent gesturing  rolling eye balls  twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements  what would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films  is here merely dull to watch  the only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is lois wilson  who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally  she is convincing and endearing in tearful close ups  as long as you dont read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak  like i said  everybody else is droningly routine  joy  meighan  even julia faye  her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom  the worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it  meighans character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of america is declining in its moral stance  and going right back to the decadence of rome   insert absurd flashback  this movies moralizing has been described as victorian  but its further than that  it has so little bearing in reality that i have a feeling audiences at that time didnt take it any more seriously than modern viewers could  this movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a typical silent movie  with its archaic moral structure  wooden acting and bad direction  demille shows that he could be a terrible director  with no sense of pacing  camera placement  or skill in handling either script or actors  i cant imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously  boring  slow and idiotic  i recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only 
"I'm guessing the writers have never read a book of any kind, much less a Dickens novel, and certainly not David Copperfield, and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay, possibly an adaptation of Copperfield, though just as likely anything else, from which they randomly discarded about a third of the pages and then shuffled the rest, along with some random pages from a screenplay that someone's eighth grade nephew had written for an English class, and for which he had received a failing grade. <br /><br />If the casting was a bad joke - e.g., Richards as Kramer playing Micawber - which it was, then the direction and acting were the poorly- delivered punch lines. Getting beyond Kramer as Micawber, if possible, Ham was such a complete ogre, hunch-back and all, that I was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitch-fork and torch wielding mob of villagers. Uriah was almost as much of a clown figure as Micawber. Mr. Murdstone evoked about as much terror as that Muppet vampire from Sesame street. The actor playing older David was, I believe, actually a woman. In any case, looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked, and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed, he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen. And while we're on that subject, in one of the many gross inaccuracies perpetrated by the half-wit producers of this embarrassment, in the unnecessary shots of David writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old, when he should be in his forties. Perhaps the greatest transgression, although it's difficult to choose, was the invented showdown between David and Murdstone as he courted a third wife in Switzerland, preceded of course by the invented death of Murdstone's second wife. While they were at it it is a wonder they didn't send Heep to the guillotine, and have him deliver Sidney Carton's famous last words. It couldn't have made things much worse really. It might have been far far better.<br /><br />There are literally thousands of small and large sins against literature throughout this miscarriage of art, and anyone who watches it runs the risk of severe and permanent damage to all aspects of their sensibility.",0,im guessing the writers have never read a book of any kind  much less a dickens novel  and certainly not david copperfield  and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay  possibly an adaptation of copperfield  though just as likely anything else  from which they randomly discarded about a third of the pages and then shuffled the rest  along with some random pages from a screenplay that someones eighth grade nephew had written for an english class  and for which he had received a failing grade   if the casting was a bad joke   e g   richards as kramer playing micawber   which it was  then the direction and acting were the poorly  delivered punch lines  getting beyond kramer as micawber  if possible  ham was such a complete ogre  hunch back and all  that i was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitch fork and torch wielding mob of villagers  uriah was almost as much of a clown figure as micawber  mr  murdstone evoked about as much terror as that muppet vampire from sesame street  the actor playing older david was  i believe  actually a woman  in any case  looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked  and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed  he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen  and while were on that subject  in one of the many gross inaccuracies perpetrated by the half wit producers of this embarrassment  in the unnecessary shots of david writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old  when he should be in his forties  perhaps the greatest transgression  although its difficult to choose  was the invented showdown between david and murdstone as he courted a third wife in switzerland  preceded of course by the invented death of murdstones second wife  while they were at it it is a wonder they didnt send heep to the guillotine  and have him deliver sidney cartons famous last words  it couldnt have made things much worse really  it might have been far far better  there are literally thousands of small and large sins against literature throughout this miscarriage of art  and anyone who watches it runs the risk of severe and permanent damage to all aspects of their sensibility 
"Interesting? Hardly. The 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we didn't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important? Nah. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was I movie I was impressed with. This is just silly garbage.<br /><br />'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?<br /><br />No, it's just plain STUPID.

"After seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out Spike Lee was directing, I was excited to hear about this event. I wasn't alive at the time, I didn't live in New York, so I expected more of a history lesson than anything. What I got was some interesting acting, a lot of sex, and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the Son of Sam. I guess the film wasn't about the Son of Sam, but it was a peek into the summer of '77. Label me disappointed.<br /><br />",0,after seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out spike lee was directing  i was excited to hear about this event  i wasnt alive at the time  i didnt live in new york  so i expected more of a history lesson than anything  what i got was some interesting acting  a lot of sex  and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the son of sam  i guess the film wasnt about the son of sam  but it was a peek into the summer of 77  label me disappointed

"This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent. He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect. The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. It may take a second viewing to remember, ""which Zapatti was which?"" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap. The ending didn't have a lot of sting. It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the movie wasn't billed as a ""huge, blockbuster"" big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack of ""splash"" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations. It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. Made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come.<br /><br />So, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!",1,this is one of the best crime drama movies during the late 1990s  it was filled with a great cast  a powerful storyline  and many of the players involved gave great performances  pacino was great  he should have been nominated for something  john cusack was good too  as long as the viewer doesnt mind his louuu siana accent  he may come off as annoying if you cant stand this dialect  the way that pacinos character interacted with cusacks character was believable  dramatic  and slightly comical at times  danny aiello was superb as always  david paymer was great in a supporting role  bridget fonda was good but not memorable  there were times when this picture mentioned so many characters  probably too many  it may take a second viewing to remember   which zapatti was which   after so many cross references  one has to stop and think just to recap  the ending didnt have a lot of sting  it was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown  this was one of the few problems with the film  since the movie wasnt billed as a  huge  blockbuster  big screen hit  it made some forget that this movie even existed  pacino and aiello were great but the films lack of  splash  in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations  it was semi successful in the home market  and viewers are still learning that this title is out there  made in 1996  it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come  so  make yourself some lemon pudding  youll see  and see this movie 
"As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",0,as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool  however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb  even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people  what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it  what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale  the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic  the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon  the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter  flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix  dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree  seriously  you just have to wonder why this movie was made  if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes  if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing  and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars 
"Wow, alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here. Wonderful. My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films. We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America. Now before you ask why am I writing a review? Instead ask why some people bash it. I'm writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films. Why do I love em, it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go. I've seen it all. Almost every horror film known to man, Argento, Fulci, Bava, Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster. I've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films. Why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place. This review is for the Devils Experiment. I find it devoid of story which is fine by me. Why do I watch horror films? So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people. The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that's all it is. Pure unadulterated violence. Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold. Why do people bash it. Cause they like a story, so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story. It make em feel better about themselves. We all want blood and gore. It's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story. The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world. Maybe I shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe I should. My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not. I've always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films. Sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place. The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody. It's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only. If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those. But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you. There is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years. They are wrong, disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom, unless she is totally cool.

"I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and I`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of Eddie Murphy so I guess this movie has something going for it<br /><br />It gets off to a bad start where Buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face .

Go on guess ? You do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at Michael Jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression , this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD<br /><br />The title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily . Obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . Not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . In fact that`s the main problem ( And boy it`s a serious one ) with this movie - The whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . I blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too .

"this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that I've ever seen on screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction. he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it's primitive in a good sense. his purity, honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art. I was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly. the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that Goldsworthy's art has. it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. Fred Frith's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound. this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect. it has no boundaries as far as age goes.",1,this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that ive ever seen on screen  andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction  he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that its primitive in a good sense  his purity  honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art  i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end  sometimes prematurely  but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly  the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthys art has  it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself  fred friths score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound  this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect  it has no boundaries as far as age goes

LOL, and you'll love the boat scene where the English guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it's midday and sunny. Bloody hilarious!!! You can tell they just didn't care about plot, they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible. Bottom line, you'll love it if you love 70's schlock.",1,cmon people  look at the title  lol  i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago  its a great  cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor  the 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie  lol  and youll love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and its midday and sunny  bloody hilarious    you can tell they just didnt care about plot  they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible  bottom line  youll love it if you love 70s schlock 
"Warning! Spoilers ahead!<br /><br /> SPOILERS<br /><br /> I've seen movie in German, so it might be, that I missed some clues.<br /><br /> Despite some weakness in the plot, it's a movie that came through to me. I liked especially Lexa Doig's acting. Sometimes I got impression, that she *is* Camille. But I can't stop wondering, what happened at the end with Bob, Cassie and baby. I belive, she, after initially being set on Bob, eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him. Otherwise it's a bit strange, that she would carry his baby and love it. It's up to viewer to decide - and I don't like such endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts .. well, I've seen him better but also worse.<br /><br /> I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story.<br /><br /> Bottom line is, I liked it very much.",1,warning  spoilers ahead   spoilers  ive seen movie in german  so it might be  that i missed some clues   despite some weakness in the plot  its a movie that came through to me  i liked especially lexa doigs acting  sometimes i got impression  that she  is  camille  but i cant stop wondering  what happened at the end with bob  cassie and baby  i belive  she  after initially being set on bob  eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him  otherwise its a bit strange  that she would carry his baby and love it  its up to viewer to decide   and i dont like such endings  dean cain was as good as ever  eric roberts    well  ive seen him better but also worse   i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story   bottom line is  i liked it very much 
"Sadly, more downs than ups. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.<br /><br />One of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was quite boring. Another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'.<br /><br />Unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon, than this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.",0,sadly  more downs than ups  the plot was pretty decent  i mean  nothing out of the ordinary  but it had a story  unlike the other modern horror flicks  the other good thing was the cast  im not saying that the acting was good  because it wasnt  but every actor actress was hot and attractive  one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so  the rest was quite boring  another down  or you could consider it an up if you want  is the excessive nudity  all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes  and all the guys showed their butts for a long time  its not that im against nudity  but this was a horror movie  not the dreamers  unless youre very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes  or watch a girl get naked for no reason  or youre a die hard fan of debbie rochon  than this is the movie for you  but if youre looking for a good horror movie  stay away 
"Kill Me Later"" has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to ""kill her later.""<br /><br />The actual execution of this premise, however, falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion. Shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around. Lack of character depth especially diminishes Selma Blair's performance, whose character Shawn vacillates from being morose to acting ""cool"" and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt. This is unfortunate, as under other circumstances Ms. Blair is an appealing and capable actress.<br /><br />Compounding matters for the worse is director Dana Lustig's insistence on using rapid cuts, incongruous special effects (e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end), and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the MTV crowd. Certainly Ms. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction, but in no way does her skill help overcome the film's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film.<br /><br />The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig)can be commended for their ability to realize this film: they were able to scare up $1.5 million to finance the film, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is no small feat for an independent film. Yet given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.",0,kill me later  has an interesting initial premise  a suicidal woman  selma blair  on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber  max beesley  who promises to  kill her later   the actual execution of this premise  however  falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion  shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around  lack of character depth especially diminishes selma blairs performance  whose character shawn vacillates from being morose to acting  cool  and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt  this is unfortunate  as under other circumstances ms  blair is an appealing and capable actress  compounding matters for the worse is director dana lustigs insistence on using rapid cuts  incongruous special effects  e g  look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end   and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the mtv crowd  certainly ms  lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction  but in no way does her skill help overcome the films inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end  clearly  lustig has a distinct visual style  however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film  the producers  ram bergman   lustig can be commended for their ability to realize this film  they were able to scare up  1 5 million to finance the film  secure a good cast  and get domestic and foreign distribution  this is no small feat for an independent film  yet given the quality of the product  the result is a mixed bag 
"This has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time. Awful acting, awful script... and they were the good points! One to Definitely miss! The jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable as to be pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I sat willing to give it a chance, hoping that it was going to improve which, alas, it didn't! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle down for a good read!

"This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see that one. This one is not so great. The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today. However, I don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like some really bad ""B"" movie where people sound like they are in some bad TV sit-com. The situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie. It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad. I don't know how they could release this movie like that.

As an adult I really did enjoy this one. I watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled at the mice.<br /><br />The music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This sequel does what Return to Neverland didn't accomplish. A good follow-up to the Cinderella story; but what becomes of Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope so!,1,as an adult i really did enjoy this one  i watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1 2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled at the mice  the music is fun and the animation is wonderful  this sequel does what return to neverland didnt accomplish  a good follow up to the cinderella story  but what becomes of drusilla  another sequel  i hope so 
"I could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in Gundam Wing, they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of Anime bliss.<br /><br />It contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months... years, and then go back to and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical Anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and English dub). It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.<br /><br />The relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch. The apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. The women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely, if at all see, which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic. It takes Heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but he gets there, and when he does, its a big pay off. <br /><br />And then there's the giant robot fighting. Fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any Hollywood epic fight scene. Any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids, as has become clear when I'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. Many of the giant robot fights in Gundam Wing contain a hefty dose of pathos, usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.<br /><br />The constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating, thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body.",1,i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing  they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts  instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss  it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months    years  and then go back to and derive new meaning from  a masterpiece in script writing  even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub   it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views  the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series  the relationship between heero and relena  and milliardo and noin are joys to watch  the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love  a word never mentioned in the series  of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment  the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely  if at all see  which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic  it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring  but he gets there  and when he does  its a big pay off   and then theres the giant robot fighting  fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene  any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids  as has become clear when im trying to recommend this series to my friends  but theyre wrong  many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos  usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete  the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring  it is a captivating  thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body 
"I've seen The Blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's.<br /><br />A strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this. A strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's, where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up. They finally believe them when the mass, now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming. It then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside. The Blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes, which is its weakness. It is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the Arctic and disposed of there. But it is only frozen, not dead...<br /><br />This movie has a typical setting for its period: teenagers and a small town. The Blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout.<br /><br />The sequel, Beware! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of The Blob movies.<br /><br />The cast is lead by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape)and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars.<br /><br />The Blob is a must see for all sci-fi fans.

"A killer, wearing a plastic white mask and black overcoat, is killing the friends of Hollywood producer Shawn Banning(Danny Wolske)who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch to chest. Perhaps the psychopath is newly hired Maddy(Dabbie Rochon), an attractive, raven haired beauty with a troubled family past, plagued with nightmares. Shawn and his friends play a practical joke on Maddy, concerning a supposed Murder Club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill. When Maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person, she finds that Shawn's pals were jerking her chain. But, Shawn and his comrades are concerned about Maddy's admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities. Deciding to wait on a definite decision, each member fall prey to the white-masked psycho with Maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before. Or, is someone else behind these murders? Low budget slasher, executive produced by Charles Band, with gore murders that fail to convince. Plenty of tits on display and Allen Nabors goofy character Chris might entertain those with low expectations. The murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing, a neck sliced, an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape, an ax buried into the back of a male victim, and, to top it all, a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax(..for added effect, the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks). There are enough plot holes to drive a truck through, such as why Maddy has nightmares of murders she didn't commit, how she could murder someone so violently(..with blood all over her)winding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her, and how Shawn could go so long, allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed, and a continual desire to join the supposed club that doesn't exist.<br /><br />What bothered me the most was the film's desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone, later proclaiming it to be an accident. The film builds Maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past. Her family disowned her for an abortion. She has black-outs and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact. In a lot of slashers, the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring, but this film goes out of it's way to point the finger at Maddy. When the twist occurs, we're left rooting for Maddy, yet we know she's not right in the head. It's a tough sell caring for this chick. She does look great in a man's Army shirt, though. And, Rochon isn't afraid to let her puppies breathe, either. Low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite Brinke Stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what Maddy did, calling her a murderer as beloved Troma producer Lloyd Kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edge-wise to protect the daughter he truly cares about. Cult siren Julie Strain has a minor cameo, showing her tits(of course)as the opening murdered male's girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer.

"After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love. The primary reason to see ""Before Sunrise,"" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As ""Celine,"" this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. <br /><br />If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as ""Jessie"" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. <br /><br />After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. <br /><br />Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason, she probably won't show, while Jesse, who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to Vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.<br /><br />Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, ""Before Sunrise"" is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel, ""Before Sunset.""",1,after a chance encounter on the train  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna  discussing life and love  the primary reason to see  before sunrise   is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines  as  celine   this sexy  brainy  soulful brown eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid twenties  risking overstatement  celine is practically the ideal woman  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural  unpretentious  introspective  and selflessly loving  we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak  for her sincere  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating  further  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing   if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar  ethan hawke as  jessie  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob  sort of a maynard g  krebs of the nineties  attempting to appear detached and nonchalant  he sort of drags himself through certain shots  his pants fit poorly  his tee shirt is coming untucked  his wavy dark hair  his most attractive feature  needs a good washing  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee  nevertheless  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two week train ride around europe  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine  his oft cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation  when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence  we know he is getting somewhere   after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes  bars  and silly diversions  they agree that because they may never see one another again  they should make the most of it  jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up   given his boundless luck in the romance department  it is especially irksome when jessie  as the very definition of a naive jerk  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp  he contents himself with a half baked plan  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu  to reunite at the same spot in half a year  when the appointed time comes  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another  perhaps even married and pregnant  for whatever reason  she probably wont show  while jesse  who ends up working at target or  if hes lucky  the local library  will go back to vienna  desperate to see her again  only to wind up alone  despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion   before sunrise  is a beautiful movie  i highly recommend both it and the sequel   before sunset

"Deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn, every single turn, in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film, and it often doesn't make any sense, although they do usually catch you by surprise. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has so many twists. The screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters, but you can't catch all the development because of the twists. The performances particularly by Caine are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can direct. The visual effects are fair, but than again most are actually in a play and are fake. Twists way to much, but still works and is worth watching.",1,deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn  every single turn  in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film  and it often doesnt make any sense  although they do usually catch you by surprise  the story is very good  except for the fact that it has so many twists  the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters  but you cant catch all the development because of the twists  the performances particularly by caine are amazing  the direction is very good  sidney lumet can direct  the visual effects are fair  but than again most are actually in a play and are fake  twists way to much  but still works and is worth watching 
"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g ""Manos  Hands of fate"") and then there are the awful bad films. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between ""one guy running around with a light bulb"" and ""non existing"". The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The Plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse.

"Cliché-ridden story of an impending divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6 year-old child. Corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red herring zombie sub-plot and, worst of all, absolutely no payoff, either emotionally or dramatically.<br /><br />Does no-one teach creative writing any more? The true sign of a weak storyteller - when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement - just end the story. I'm compelled to ask, ""what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place!?"" <br /><br />Good, but wasted, debut by child actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable.

"Let me give a quick summery of the film: A rotten, rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam: a rapping genie. Like all genies, he grants 3 wishes but, being good natured, also helps Max with his personal life, as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime. During all this, Kazaam raps from time to time, (also showcasing Shaq's dismal rap skills).<br /><br />This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to stick to sports. I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible. The characters are either unlikable or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialog is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke. I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws.",0,let me give a quick summery of the film  a rotten  rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam  a rapping genie  like all genies  he grants 3 wishes but  being good natured  also helps max with his personal life  as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime  during all this  kazaam raps from time to time   also showcasing shaqs dismal rap skills   this movie proves what we all know  athletes need to stick to sports  i admit that it never looked like an oscar worthy movie  but everything about this waste of film is horrible  the characters are either unlikable or stupid  the plot is not even worth mentioning  the dialog is a joke  and shaq is only a quarter of the problem  hell  even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke  i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big  no pun intended  at the time  i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time  shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws 
"It's a hideous little production, apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches. It's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the cold, inhuman, unfriendly, sickening, even creepy kind of weird. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it re-enforces the stereotype that the French have no concept of scary.",0,its a hideous little production  apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches  its an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop motion animation  its weird  but its not the kind of fun  weird trip anyone optimistic might expect  its the cold  inhuman  unfriendly  sickening  even creepy kind of weird  there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie  after all  disney did a fantastic job with the same source material  and cosgrove hall did far more attractive things with stop motion  interestingly  this is a french production  as such  it re enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary 
"Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-running internet only fan film, done completely for the love of the series, and a must watch for fans of Trek. The production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin' it. This doesn't take away from the overall experience however. The CGI ships are fantastic, as well as the space battle scenes... On the negative side, I could tell in the earlier episodes (and even occasionally in the newer ones) that some of the actors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles, but once again, this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek. The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.",1,star trek  hidden frontier is a long running internet only fan film  done completely for the love of the series  and a must watch for fans of trek  the production quality is extremely high for a fan film  although sometimes you can tell that theyre green screenin it  this doesnt take away from the overall experience however  the cgi ships are fantastic  as well as the space battle scenes    on the negative side  i could tell in the earlier episodes  and even occasionally in the newer ones  that some of the actors actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles  but once again  this doesnt take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek  the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here  and  as a whole i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9 
"I've seen this film in avant-premiere at Imagina Festival in Monaco.<br /><br />I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, I was waiting to see the final result. I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />It is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. Clearly inspired by some comic books, such as the ones from F. Miller. In this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent ""Sin City"" adaptation from R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) no Grey or any middle color, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film.(can't wait for scanner darkly)<br /><br />The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. The direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise.<br /><br />The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end. Despite a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations)the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms...)gives this movie a great interest.<br /><br />Despite it is an animated film, this one is obviously not made for children. You won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. It is far closer to a good film noir.<br /><br />I found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film: we still feel the well known Paris, but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I regret a few mistakes. The montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some poor dialogs. Even though the technical is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like ""final fantasy"" did). Those little things makes it a 7/10.<br /><br />Altogether, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (luckyly, they didn't ask John Woo to do the job!).<br /><br />To conclude, it is a film with blasting visuals, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. Watch it if you can!<br /><br />Please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.",1,ive seen this film in avant premiere at imagina festival in monaco  i saw the first trailer four years ago  and from this moment  i was waiting to see the final result  i havent been disappointed  it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render  clearly inspired by some comic books  such as the ones from f  miller  in this optic  it goes one step further than the excellent  sin city  adaptation from r  rodriguez  this time   almost  no grey or any middle color  but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film  cant wait for scanner darkly  the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements  such as direction or plot  the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium  and that is a really good surprise  the futuristic story  paris 2053  makes it a classic sci fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end  despite a classic base plot  an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes  genetics  absolute power of certain firms    gives this movie a great interest  despite it is an animated film  this one is obviously not made for children  you wont find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral  only the cold reality  it is far closer to a good film noir  i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film  we still feel the well known paris  but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism  nevertheless  i regret a few mistakes  the montage is sometimes a bit flat  one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some poor dialogs  even though the technical is excellent  it shows its limits in some romantic sequences  a bit like  final fantasy  did   those little things makes it a 7 10  altogether  it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can  the director  christian volckman  knows how not to fall into potential traps  luckyly  they didnt ask john woo to do the job    to conclude  it is a film with blasting visuals  an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction  watch it if you can  please excuse me for the spelling mistakes 
"This movie is a ripoff of James Cain's novel, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. Apparently, the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story--perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties! Despite this, the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie. In some ways it's a lot better and in other ways, it is definitely not.<br /><br />The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people. In fact, the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking. The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair (particularly on the back and shoulders) and his lady love is, to put it frankly, unattractive. They are a very, very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version. And the ill-fated husband is really, really obese and loves to walk around shirtless--and his counterpart in the American film, Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking (and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads, actually). And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film--since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed ""dish"" like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway--I am 100% sure she would have had dozens of better offers! Whereas, the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable.<br /><br />Part of the Italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex. The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway, they never actually get around to sex! This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic. In addition to the casual sexuality of the film, it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life--with lots of sweaty people, a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath.<br /><br />The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film. And what you get due to brevity isn't all good. The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film--with grainier footage, relatively poor orchestration and sets. It sure ain't a pretty film, but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic. But it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot. Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over. And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film--and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats (the best part of the American film).<br /><br />So which is the better film? Well, a lot of this probably depends on you. As for me, the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic (though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles)--but it packed a great ending. And the Italian film was much, much more realistic--until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed. So neither film is exactly great, but I'd give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better. It's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film.",1,this movie is a ripoff of james cains novel  the postman always rings twice  apparently  the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story  perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties  despite this  the movie isnt really just an italian version of the hollywood movie  in some ways its a lot better and in other ways  it is definitely not  the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people  in fact  the male and female lovers are a bit icky looking  the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair  particularly on the back and shoulders  and his lady love is  to put it frankly  unattractive  they are a very  very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version  and the ill fated husband is really  really obese and loves to walk around shirtless  and his counterpart in the american film  cecil kellaway is definitely better looking  and probably better looking than the other two italian leads  actually   and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film  since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed  dish  like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway  i am 100  sure she would have had dozens of better offers  whereas  the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable  part of the italian films believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex  the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway  they never actually get around to sex  this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic  in addition to the casual sexuality of the film  its also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life  with lots of sweaty people  a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath  the movie is also pretty fast paced compared to the over long american film  and what you get due to brevity isnt all good  the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film  with grainier footage  relatively poor orchestration and sets  it sure aint a pretty film  but the neo realistic like style makes the film seem more realistic  but it cannot make up for the short cuts in the plot  many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over  and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film  and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats  the best part of the american film   so which is the better film  well  a lot of this probably depends on you  as for me  the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic  though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles   but it packed a great ending  and the italian film was much  much more realistic  until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed  so neither film is exactly great  but id give my nod to the italian one being a bit better  its too bad they couldnt have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film 
"When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. The stunts are very much like the Matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far. Another reason why I the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie. The way Gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act, VERY ANIME.

It's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain BAD, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both!

"Near the closing stages of Baby Mama, one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess'; I really couldn't say it any better than that. And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again, the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time. A lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour. Consisting mainly of very routine, cliché jokes based around an odd couple (rich and poor) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world, the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic.<br /><br />As a story on finding love, it's not that bad, but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent, characterisation is notably weak, resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles. As characters themselves, both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces, but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness; so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times, the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles; we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting, but rather their dynamic. Unfortunately however, although this dynamic works best, or at least better than the individual personas, as mentioned above, it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula.<br /><br />Kate (Tina Fey) is a successful business woman who has hired working class, dumb-blonde Angie (Amy Poehler) to be her unlikely surrogate, and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl (Dax Shepard), both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences. Yes, it's the typical odd-couple premise, and one that we have already seen in this year's What Happens in Vegas, yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters. Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air. In fact, the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man. Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama, most of those moments were because of this man, and the remainder usually fell to Shepard.<br /><br />It's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera, and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough. Yet, for a film about babies, multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping, this isn't necessarily a good thing. Baby Mama is grade-A, hammy, plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar. So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature, but I simply didn't care for the world they inhabited. The dialogue, along with sets, costumes, and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy; these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any way so why should I care? At the end of the day however, a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests, and the frequency of its laughs; Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments. Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair. I'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings, but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored. In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable, but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch, Baby Mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",0,near the closing stages of baby mama  one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess  i really couldnt say it any better than that  and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again  the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyones time  a lacklustre cast  mundane script and vague  caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isnt taxing on the ol noggin  but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour  consisting mainly of very routine  cliché jokes based around an odd couple  rich and poor  trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world  the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic  as a story on finding love  its not that bad  but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy orientated odd couple tangent  characterisation is notably weak  resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles  as characters themselves  both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces  but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness  so while we may eventually come to find the characters interactions with each other amusing at times  the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles  we dont feel for the characters and dont find them inherently interesting  but rather their dynamic  unfortunately however  although this dynamic works best  or at least better than the individual personas  as mentioned above  it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula  kate  tina fey  is a successful business woman who has hired working class  dumb blonde angie  amy poehler  to be her unlikely surrogate  and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl  dax shepard   both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences  yes  its the typical odd couple premise  and one that we have already seen in this years what happens in vegas  yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters  kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air  in fact  the movies only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door man  of the few times that i laughed during baby mama  most of those moments were because of this man  and the remainder usually fell to shepard  its a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its scripts themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera  and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough  yet  for a film about babies  multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping  this isnt necessarily a good thing  baby mama is grade a  hammy  plastic tinsel town with capital bore topped with sugar  so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature  but i simply didnt care for the world they inhabited  the dialogue  along with sets  costumes  and the scripts general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the directors incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy  these arent characters and that isnt our world in any way so why should i care  at the end of the day however  a romantic comedys ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests  and the frequency of its laughs  baby mama has little going on in any of these departments  of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair  im sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings  but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored  in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable  but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience  a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch  baby mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining    a review by jamie robert ward  http   www invocus net

The music made them more dramatic that they actually were.<br /><br />There is a lot of symbolism in here, so the elitist critics label this ""a thinking person's horror film.""

"In THE BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a real envoy from the United States who was responsible for truly opening up Japan to International relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Commodore Perry basically pushed into Japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived just a bit later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance--as many of the Japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty. All this is true and shown in the film. According to some other sources I found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese Geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film (hence, the title).<br /><br />My first reaction the first time I saw this movie was one of surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat?! When he's being diplomatic in most films, he says please and thank you as he pummels people!!!! So seeing him playing a man who is NOT a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed. In fact, I can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen photos of Harris and Wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all.<br /><br />However, despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting, the film is still very watchable. The color cinematography is nice, the film shows some nice insights into Japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad. All in all, a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting.<br /><br />PS--Read through the trivia for this film. You find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where Wayne apparently knocked him out!! Based on what I've read about Huston and the way he got along with actors, this is an incident I tend to believe. And, it's also a nice example of John Wayne ""diplomacy"".",1,in the barbarian and the geisha  john wayne plays townsend harris  a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s  before him  commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853  harris  who arrived just a bit later  worked through the details and helped ensure compliance  as many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty  all this is true and shown in the film  according to some other sources i found  the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film  hence  the title   my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise  john wayne as a diplomat   when hes being diplomatic in most films  he says please and thank you as he pummels people     so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed  in fact  i cant think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role  by the way  ive seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all  however  despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting  the film is still very watchable  the color cinematography is nice  the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isnt bad  all in all  a likable and watchable film despite its odd casting  ps  read through the trivia for this film  you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director  john huston  where wayne apparently knocked him out   based on what ive read about huston and the way he got along with actors  this is an incident i tend to believe  and  its also a nice example of john wayne  diplomacy  
"*Possible Spoiler*<br /><br />'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting.<br /><br />'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this. It seemed as if HE wasn't even interested in doing the sequel. His acting was good but it could have been better. I really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion, they're not even worth mentioning. But I'll do it. The character of Alison isn't even hardly shown in the first part of the film. All of a sudden she's the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role didn't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else, anybody else. The director, Mike, was a confusing character. He seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't seem like his death was necessary. The acting for this role was good, nothing great but better than Salem's.<br /><br />The plot was real lousy if you think about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, makes his way onto the set of 'Cabin by the Lake', the movie based on his script. He stumbles upon the director and in a short time, the director is dead and Stanley is running the show. Yeah, out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him. There's some killings, not a whole lot, and the one's that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character gets chewed up by a motorboat. And one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been hard up for excitement.<br /><br />I just have to say that I was not impressed with the filming of the movie. The way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast. Also, the new cabin by the lake was poorly created. We aren't shown it but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more, but it didn't work in this one.<br /><br />There were too many characters in this sequel. All of them except for a few had no reason to be there. The acting of what little is showed was really bad and...they just didn't have a purpose in this movie.<br /><br />All in all, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off. 'Cabin by the Lake' I can take but this was just not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this one and so should you. It's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second. Not to mention that the writing was horrible. Put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep.<br /><br />So, we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. By the way he talks, it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself. Quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright!<br /><br />(Did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one? They were all done in a tank. Never, never reveal the secrets of filming.)<br /><br />",0, possible spoiler  return to cabin by the lake is a useless movie  the acting was not good and the plot wasnt even remotely interesting  cabin by the lake is a good tv movie  the sequel was not  judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this  it seemed as if he wasnt even interested in doing the sequel  his acting was good but it could have been better  i really dont want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion  theyre not even worth mentioning  but ill do it  the character of alison isnt even hardly shown in the first part of the film  all of a sudden shes the center of attention next to stanley caldwell  the role didnt make sense and it should have been thought out a little better  dahlia salem was absolutely terrible  her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else  anybody else  the director  mike  was a confusing character  he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didnt seem like his death was necessary  the acting for this role was good  nothing great but better than salems  the plot was real lousy if you think about it  stanley  who is presumed dead  makes his way onto the set of cabin by the lake  the movie based on his script  he stumbles upon the director and in a short time  the director is dead and stanley is running the show  yeah  out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him  theres some killings  not a whole lot  and the ones that are shown are ridiculous  one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene  another character gets chewed up by a motorboat  and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning  these writers must have been hard up for excitement  i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie  the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast  also  the new cabin by the lake was poorly created  we arent shown it but only in a few scenes  and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless  it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more  but it didnt work in this one  there were too many characters in this sequel  all of them except for a few had no reason to be there  the acting of what little is showed was really bad and   they just didnt have a purpose in this movie  all in all  return to cabin by the lake is a sequel picking up from where the first left off  cabin by the lake i can take but this was just not impressive  judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you  its nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow  nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second  not to mention that the writing was horrible  put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep  so  we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well  by the way he talks  it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself  quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright   did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one  they were all done in a tank  never  never reveal the secrets of filming  
"Some unrealistic movie spoilers included.<br /><br />From real life experiences, this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning. I'm currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man. This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences. From the very start to name a few: the bomb cart, the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts, the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC, having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs, to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy, the sniper scene.

"More TV movies ought to be made like this one. I saw it way back in '93 when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrific, giving very gritty and realistic performances. Weber was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed ""Hoosiers,"" which was somehow both formulaic and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple realism that is so appealing. If you like TV movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting, see it if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story.",1,more tv movies ought to be made like this one  i saw it way back in 93 when it was first on tv  helen hunt and steven weber were both terrific  giving very gritty and realistic performances  weber was especially good  turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester killer  this film really increased my respect for hunt as an actress  the director also directed  hoosiers   which was somehow both formulaic and exciting  but the direction in both of these works has the same stark  simple realism that is so appealing  if you like tv movies that arent predictable and filled with overacting  see it if you can  the side story about hunt and faheys affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story

"Sorry everyone,,, I know this is supposed to be an ""art"" film,, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch. Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a sound track was brutal. The loooonnnnng shots were too long. How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. I really had a hard time just getting through this film. The performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, uninspired, stuff can you take? The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene.

"Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. And, while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to, I couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN!

And, technically the stunts and camera-work are good, so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, Rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped ""romance"" and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo, none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark! And, while the bad guys are using AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers!

"I'm a fan of both actors/singers especially Gackt and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer,I just think this is a silly one.After a long waiting time,I watched it at last and here's my comment...<br /><br />I consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first applause goes to acting,generally that Japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.Yet in MoonChild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it,especially Gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,I like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for HYDE part,his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.I didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel of the film is story.It has some cheesy moments but it's OK for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals.An interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of American cinema,actually Moon Child is somehow can be seen as brother with Interwiew,yet original on it's own.Only problem that MoonChild is it's a bit slow sometimes,I'm a Japanese movie fan and I used to that but it's not change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters.But all in all;this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo I hope to see their other movies in future,and I recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10",1,im a fan of both actors singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer i just think this is a silly one after a long waiting time i watched it at last and heres my comment    i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it instead of it my first applause goes to acting generally that japanese movies hasnt got brilliant and acting yet in moonchilds all cast is simply wonderful and got into it especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones as for hyde part his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor respectively as his character do throughout the movie i didnt like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget it still has brilliant moments but the real jewel of the film is story it has some cheesy moments but its ok for me and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals an interesting note aside this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful not handsome beautiful actors of american cinema actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew yet original on its own only problem that moonchild is its a bit slow sometimes im a japanese movie fan and i used to that but its not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters but all in all this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes as for actors singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire action sci fiction and romance films 8 10

"When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, I thought it was too harsh but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.<br /><br />Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was OK...nothing great. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Wait for it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.",0,when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies  i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct  i am a big fan of the wayans brothers  i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks  little man  however  had very few laughs and the jokes were stale  obviously  the joke will revolve around marlon wayans  who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison  he and his partner  tracy morgan  steal a diamond meant for a gangster  things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington  in order to get the diamond back  the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep  of course  he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond  the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour  all these talents  however  cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny  the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok  i mean  it was not 100  believable but it was ok   nothing great  i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses  wait for it on cable or television  it really is not worth any amount of money 
"The Omega Code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency. There was a bit (but precious little) of good acting, primarily by the two prophets and Rostenberg, who only appeared once and had no lines. Otherwise the acting was decidedly bad. The plot line was rather weak, and only partially based on already questionable Biblical interpretation. Certainly not one of the year's best.",0,the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency  there was a bit  but precious little  of good acting  primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg  who only appeared once and had no lines  otherwise the acting was decidedly bad  the plot line was rather weak  and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation  certainly not one of the years best 
"Apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Hitler and Stalin Era. Nuremberg (and a lot of forgotten trials all over Europe) was a revenge and injustice of the winners. What do you think, why were not any American, British, French or Soviet defendants after the WWII? There were no American, British etc. war crimes? There were no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans had war crimes too, but in Nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (That was also a book title in America, 1941.)<br /><br />This film is an awful, ignoble American brainwashing instrument, full of error, lie, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly... Why wasn't enough the Nuremberg process itself? This film is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hate and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so forth.

"I'm not entirely sure Rob Schmidt qualifies as a ""Master"" in the genre of horror, since he previously just directed one horror film called ""Wrong Turn"" and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre, but fact is that he made with ""Right to Die"" one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the ""Masters of Horror"" franchise. There was a similar underdog story in season one, when William Malone made on of the best episodes with ""The Fair Haired Child"" even though his other long feature films ""Fear Dot Com"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"" sucked pretty badly.<br /><br />The story of ""Right to Die"" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery, the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney (Corbin Bernsen of ""The Dentist"") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, Abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff. Meanwhile Abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. After a few victims, Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. ""Right to Die"" is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TV-series concept like ""Masters of Horror"". It's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard.

"This film definitely gets a thumbs up from me. It's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on Eastern European people had me in stitches throughout most of the film. It's plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film. The one person I was most impressed with in this film was Hilary Duff. It's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the 'chick-flick' genre she's used to. Her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed. It is the best performance I have ever seen from Hilary, and I have seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah is described as 'The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song, 'I want to blow you... ... ... up'. You also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour, but also her facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout. I strongly recommend this film.",1,this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me  its witty jokes and even its occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film  its plot is clever and 100  original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film  the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff  its plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the chick flick genre shes used to  her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well executed  it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary  and i have seen most of her films  her character  yonica babyyeah is described as the britney spears of eastern europe and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song  i want to blow you            up  you also feel sorry for her  as her performance really grasps you  yonica is a very complex and confused character  joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour  but also her facial expressions and so on  john cusacks witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout  i strongly recommend this film 
"This was a terrible film. There was no story line whatsoever. To top it all off, when they couldn't explain the blood and gore (the only good part) ... they threw in a few aliens!

Two things: How could Vinny say ""welcome"" when he didn't have a tongue? Its a pity Mr Jones didn't have a bigger role.

"This film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they didn't quite come together. I don't know who made it, but it has a slightly Disney-esque feel. While parts of it are improbable (like when a pre-teen runs for a public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normalcy (whatever that is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. The acting is alright. Strangely, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit...off. It's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend, her grandmother, and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to watch Frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys, but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces. I read somewhere that she isn't really ballerina, but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star Mischa Barton didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in ""Lawn Dogs"", ""Lost and Delirious"", and her small but shocking performance opposite Haley Joel Osment in ""The 6th Sense.""",1,this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients  but somewhere along the way they didnt quite come together  i dont know who made it  but it has a slightly disney esque feel  while parts of it are improbable  like when a pre teen runs for a public office  and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously  there is a healthy dose of normalcy  whatever that is  to keep things balanced and in perspective  the acting is alright  strangely  the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing  but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit   off  its interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend  her grandmother  and her two passions  ballet and baseball  being a baseball player myself  it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys  but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces  i read somewhere that she isnt really ballerina  but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful  overall  it was a good film about honesty and ambition  but its star mischa barton didnt quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in  lawn dogs    lost and delirious   and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in  the 6th sense  
"i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had. only £300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism involved in the story) i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story, the more sadness you feel. more so towards Heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned.<br /><br />this is one of my favourite British films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again. i think that it's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all.",1,i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had  only £300 000 and 7 weeks to write  film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself  although this film is not for the masses  as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo eroticism involved in the story  i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story  the more sadness you feel  more so towards heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned  this is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again  i think that its a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all 
"I love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say ""silent hill"" ( which i found to be quite good, but still, was missing something ) and movies that keeps you guessing, this i thought was one of those movies. At first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down. I mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of ""stolen"" themes from that movie in here.. All in all i would say, watch silent hill instead of this one, its better, its more scary, it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better.. And best of all, you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one.. This just seems to be one of those ""i like that movie so I'm gonna re-make it in my own really bad version"" kinda movie..

"I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their ""real"" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable.

"Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal 'Crocodile' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is 90 years old, over 30 ft long (!) and it kills for fun! During the film, he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they're not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again. But 'funny' for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended.",0,fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately  blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid  redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down  crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal crocodile  directed by a disappointing tobe hooper  and lake placid  blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously  the saltwater crocodile supposedly is 90 years old  over 30 ft long     and it kills for fun  during the film  he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes   dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area  the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location  even though its a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this  the lagoons and nature looks marvelous  every other aspect is simply disastrous  theres a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable  the dialogues are downright painful to listen to  you wont believe some of the lines these actors have to say  i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake theyre not that stupid  early in the film  one of the characters refers to jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than spielbergs great white shark  the visual effects in blood surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress  i wont say too much about the acting since its secondary in flicks like this  the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast  you guessed right  blood surf is a very bad film  so bad it becomes fun again  but funny for a whole other reason than james hickox intended

"I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars but, other than his, I have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love, and sacrifice (three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common).<br /><br />Here the major theme is class division. Stella is a story from depression era America. That said, it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake (if you ask a Stanwyck fan or two) was not exactly appreciated. Fans of the original never gave it a chance. Furthermore, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, not exactly a time of great financial trouble in America (as the depression was).<br /><br />Now is the time to remove the rosy-coloured glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and see that this powerful story still rings true, is as timely and relevant as ever, in its updated format.<br /><br />Yes, class divide is the major theme here. Stella is among the working poor, single, with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams. She works in a bar, doesn't have much money, lives in a crummy apartment. You get the drift. In the morning, she doesn't really want to get out of bed. On her wall, pictures of movie stars she idolizes.<br /><br />A man sees her dance at the bar. He's wealthy, educated, from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with Stella's. His major concern is what ivy league college to attend, her's is how to pay the rent, how to be 'happy.' They have an affair. They like each other. Stella ends up pregnant. Stella tells the guy the news. His response? ""How about an abortion?"" She replies, ""I just wanted a room full of balloons."" He supplies the balloons, and the proposal, but she sees his heart is not in it, and has too much pride to accept. She sends him packing.<br /><br />Her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles--the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father. Stella, alone and unloved, and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday, makes the ultimate sacrifice.

Everything is right about it. Beautiful score, artful cinematography, great set design (contrast between the two lifestyles; the messy apt. and the decorated mansions), wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast, with Bette Midler, in particular, Oscar-worthy.<br /><br />This is a film which is much more significant and well-made than you've been led to believe.",1,i think it was ebert who gave stella four out of four stars but  other than his  i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions  love  and sacrifice  three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common   here the major theme is class division  stella is a story from depression era america  that said  it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake  if you ask a stanwyck fan or two  was not exactly appreciated  fans of the original never gave it a chance  furthermore  this version of stella was made in the 1990s  not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america  as the depression was   now is the time to remove the rosy coloured glasses  in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in america  and see that this powerful story still rings true  is as timely and relevant as ever  in its updated format  yes  class divide is the major theme here  stella is among the working poor  single  with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams  she works in a bar  doesnt have much money  lives in a crummy apartment  you get the drift  in the morning  she doesnt really want to get out of bed  on her wall  pictures of movie stars she idolizes  a man sees her dance at the bar  hes wealthy  educated  from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with stellas  his major concern is what ivy league college to attend  hers is how to pay the rent  how to be happy  they have an affair  they like each other  stella ends up pregnant  stella tells the guy the news  his response   how about an abortion   she replies   i just wanted a room full of balloons   he supplies the balloons  and the proposal  but she sees his heart is not in it  and has too much pride to accept  she sends him packing  her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles  the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father  stella  alone and unloved  and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday  makes the ultimate sacrifice  she gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter  and perhaps live vicariously  and with hope  knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for  now  for the movie  everything is right about it  beautiful score  artful cinematography  great set design  contrast between the two lifestyles  the messy apt  and the decorated mansions   wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast  with bette midler  in particular  oscar worthy  this is a film which is much more significant and well made than youve been led to believe 
"From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her?! The show not the same as before. Its way worse.<br /><br />The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can't replace someone from the beginning! That is like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! It's not right! The niece who replaced her is just, ugh! Awful. She doesn't fit into the storyline at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece can't replace her.

"Not since The Simpsons made it's debut has there been a sitcom that I didn't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes. It has of course been said that The Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not this one though.<br /><br />The first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became. They even went to school sometimes. The following seasons the character where fledged out. Eric, the sarcastic twit, Donna, his levelheaded girlfriend, Kelso, the dim bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie, the spoiled rich floozy. As for the adult characters there was Eric's mom, the ""can you believe she is so ditzy"" suburban mom, Eric's dad, the straight arrow who of course wasn't such a hard ass as he seemed, Donna's goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom. Everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.<br /><br />Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. It's a tough character to play because it doesn't allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the Kelso character, played competently by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.<br /><br />Hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time, although I will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.<br /><br />Jackie, played by Family Guy voice artist Mila Kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice, which actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and Eric because they were f...... hilarious together. Too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with Eric and Donna.<br /><br />Last I will say that the casting of guest actors were always great. A few favorites: Fez' humongous girlfriend in the mid-seasons, Pastor Dan, the totally awesome Leo played by the equally awesome Thomas Chong, another one of Fez' girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty catholic girl.<br /><br />Coming up next on Fox, whatever.",1,not since the simpsons made its debut has there been a sitcom that i didnt want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes  it has of course been said that the simpsons killed the sitcom  not this one though  the first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became  they even went to school sometimes  the following seasons the character where fledged out  eric  the sarcastic twit  donna  his levelheaded girlfriend  kelso  the dim bulb  hyde  the conspiracy theorist and anti establishment punk  fez  the pervert exchange student and finally jackie  the spoiled rich floozy  as for the adult characters there was erics mom  the  can you believe she is so ditzy  suburban mom  erics dad  the straight arrow who of course wasnt such a hard ass as he seemed  donnas goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom  everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to kurtwood smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his red forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness  topher grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good  its a tough character to play because it doesnt allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the kelso character  played competently by ashton kutcher  i enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different  hydes character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time  although i will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons  jackie  played by family guy voice artist mila kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice  which actually fits her character  the only sad part is that we didnt see more scenes with her and eric because they were f       hilarious together  too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with eric and donna  last i will say that the casting of guest actors were always great  a few favorites  fez humongous girlfriend in the mid seasons  pastor dan  the totally awesome leo played by the equally awesome thomas chong  another one of fez girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch sabrina as a slutty catholic girl  coming up next on fox  whatever

"I saw this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm also a movie/theatre director and I know what I speak. This is not Romania anymore, but I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. Just empty images.<br /><br />What most of Romanians don't know, this movie is for the french viewers, not for us. They really believe that is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I don't really know if we can call this a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we've got such an image in Europe. This WAS a reality, but isn't anymore.

"I saw this movie in my childhood. And after 10 years I did not remember anything about this movie but I found out it I also don't know how I was able to find out this movie. Its my life. My all times favorite movie. My words will fall short of true meaning what I have inside for this movie. I follow this movie. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, scary and martial arts. The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm. It's a masterpiece of Hong Kong Cinema.<br /><br />Sinnui Yauman, is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging, deep in the woods, a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near. The trek alone is perilous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple.<br /><br />Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple. She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love.<br /><br />Ling Choi Sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods. There's great martial arts, even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms. The movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, leaping from tree to tree, with elegant long gowns and scarves, but the movie genuinely flows, and everything is effective.<br /><br />Tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster, which cant be good, and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice.<br /><br />In the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue, and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls, and bring Ling's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation.<br /><br />A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details. One is touched in many ways by this movie, you'll laugh, cry, and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. And though at the end, Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow, we never know if Tsing was afforded a reincarnation, but we do know her.",1,i saw this movie in my childhood  and after 10 years i did not remember anything about this movie but i found out it i also dont know how i was able to find out this movie  its my life  my all times favorite movie  my words will fall short of true meaning what i have inside for this movie  i follow this movie  its a brilliant mix of fantasy  comedy  romance  horror  erotic  scary and martial arts  the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm  its a masterpiece of hong kong cinema  sinnui yauman  is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film  written by songling pu and directed by siu tung ching  a chinese ghost story has it all  ling choi sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging  deep in the woods  a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near  the trek alone is perilous with wolves  and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple  ling choi sin meets tsing  a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple  she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress  but when she meets innocent ling choi sin they fall in love  ling choi sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place  while tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods  he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods  theres great martial arts  even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms  the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics  with magic and flying through the air  leaping from tree to tree  with elegant long gowns and scarves  but the movie genuinely flows  and everything is effective  tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster  which cant be good  and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice  in the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue  and go with yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls  and bring lings ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation  a beautiful story that truly pays attention to details  one is touched in many ways by this movie  youll laugh  cry  and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography  and though at the end  yin and ling choi sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow  we never know if tsing was afforded a reincarnation  but we do know her 
"TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />In late 19th century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school at Rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (Stephen Fry) and stands up to the school's resident bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie).<br /><br />Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably Gordon Parry's superior 1951 version - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV's ""Where the Heart Is"") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It's pleasant enough, and watchable, but it's also rather staid and dull, distinguished only by Fry's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school's most dubious 'traditions', and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old Pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is typical UK TV fodder, the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with 'prestige' product, even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this. The UK publication 'Radio Times' described it as ""daintily odd"" and raised a querulous eyebrow over ""all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys"".

I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work I probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . When I was a child I wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count <br /><br />Judging by this film version of TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN I guess Pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist Tom Long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . Having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the 1950s so I guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . There`s also a romance involving a young girl called Hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories ? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative <br /><br />This is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . It`s inoffensive but I`m surprised by its high rating by the IMDB voters . I wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who`d just seen the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy ?,0,i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child   when i was a child i wasn t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count  judging by this film version of tom s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one   having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn t have in the 1950s so i guess there s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere   there s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories   perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative  this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source   it s inoffensive but i m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters   i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy  
"The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. After that, it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I couldn't stop thinking of Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point. The thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed $22 million in the box office and only cost about $1.5 million to make.

"- Having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of New York City, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He's hoping to find the simple life. But, building a house proves to be anything but simple. As the headaches and the bills start piling up, so do the laughs. Will Mr. Blanding's ever get his dream house? <br /><br />- What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas. Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. He is so good at playing the put upon husband. Loy is a always a joy to watch. The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect. And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine.<br /><br />- The movie is definitely a product of its time. I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three bedroom, four bathroom house on $15,000 income a year. Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful.<br /><br />- However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the Blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today. And that's where the comedy comes in. How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole ""wife in love with best friend"" subplot.

"Everybody knows that Gregory Widen's original ""The Prophecy"" didn't really require a sequel, but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable. Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel, meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action, more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery. The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel, and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental. If it wasn't for Walken's performance (and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig), ""The Prophecy II"" surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release. The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth. The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beals) from getting born. For you see, her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly ""monkey"" and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel's evil dominion. Thus, just as in the first movie, he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown. ""The Prophecy II"" is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity. Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious, the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you. His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences. On a slightly off-topic note, I often felt like ""The Prophecy II"" ambitions to look similar to ""Terminator II""  Gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location, where the final battle takes place, looks very similar to the steel factory where ""Terminator II"" ended as well. Coincidence, I guess? Overall, this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of Christopher Walken's unique acting charisma (and who isn't?).",0,everybody knows that gregory widens original  the prophecy  didnt really require a sequel  but you also dont need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable  part two is a very prototypic example of a straight to video sequel  meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action  more witty one liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery  the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel  and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental  if it wasnt for walkens performance  and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig    the prophecy ii  surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release  the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth  the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales  jennifer beals  from getting born  for you see  her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly  monkey  and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriels evil dominion  thus  just as in the first movie  he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown   the prophecy ii  is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you dont make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity  whenever the storyline becomes too tedious  the makers luckily enough always insert a near brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you  his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences  on a slightly off topic note  i often felt like  the prophecy ii  ambitions to look similar to  terminator ii   gabriels resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location  where the final battle takes place  looks very similar to the steel factory where  terminator ii  ended as well  coincidence  i guess  overall  this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case youre a fan of christopher walkens unique acting charisma  and who isnt   
"Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney keeping the Miramax brand) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. THE FLOCK is a prime example.<br /><br />A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU.<br /><br />Richard Gere gives his best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. The cinematography, pacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and I saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around or excess camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is handled with restraint, but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick.<br /><br />Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the ""rights"" of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. Each such step was met with praise by Liberals, who celebrated the Warren Court's ill deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagree. In 2007 how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office. Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can tare anyone's family to shreds.<br /><br />Richard Gere is a Liberal, but he gives his best in his performance here.

"(SPOILERS IN FIRST PARAGRAPH) This movie's anti-German sentiment seems painfully dated now, but it's a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda. It was made back when Cecil B. DeMille was still a great director. (Ignore all his later Best Picture Academy Awards; he never made a very good sound film.) This movie lacks the comedy of most of Pickford's other films, and really it was DeMille's movie, not Pickford's. The vilification of the Germans can be compared to the way ""The Patriot"" of 2000 did the same to the British. The only good German in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austreheim. They even had Pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a German submarine. So what'll get the Americans more stirred up to war? The sinking of the Lusitania, or watching America's favorite Canadian import sinking in it? All throughout the film DeMille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another, barely escaping death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution, and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed. The way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in ""Jurassic Park"" were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors. If I was any more gullible to such propaganda I would punish myself for having a part-German ancestry. <br /><br />Was it a good film? Aside from a humorous running gag about Americans abroad thinking they're untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained. You'll find it more than a little melodramatic, and obviously one-sided, but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before Potemkin's false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movie's potential for propaganda. It made me wonder: what became of Cecil B. DeMille? Somewhere between the advent of sound and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" he seemed to lose his ambition. Ben Hur looked expensive, but not ambitious. In a sentence, this movie is for 1) Film historians, 2) Silent Film Buffs, 3) Mary Pickford fans, or 4) DeMille fans, if such a person exists.",1, spoilers in first paragraph  this movies anti german sentiment seems painfully dated now  but its a brilliant example of great war time propaganda  it was made back when cecil b  demille was still a great director   ignore all his later best picture academy awards  he never made a very good sound film   this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickfords other films  and really it was demilles movie  not pickfords  the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way  the patriot  of 2000 did the same to the british  the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim  they even had pickford take an ill fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine  so whatll get the americans more stirred up to war  the sinking of the lusitania  or watching americas favorite canadian import sinking in it  all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another  barely escaping death  hypothermia  depravity  rape  execution  and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed  the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in  jurassic park  were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors  if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a part german ancestry   was it a good film  aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking theyre untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained  youll find it more than a little melodramatic  and obviously one sided  but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before potemkins false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movies potential for propaganda  it made me wonder  what became of cecil b  demille  somewhere between the advent of sound and  the greatest show on earth  he seemed to lose his ambition  ben hur looked expensive  but not ambitious  in a sentence  this movie is for 1  film historians  2  silent film buffs  3  mary pickford fans  or 4  demille fans  if such a person exists

Where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the Interstate. The location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by Martians. But these Martians are totally inept, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons... including one set on eradicating the Martians, too! The Martians dead-pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them... leave earth. J. J.

"A powerfully wonderful movie. You are held in a death-grip once you let yourself get involved with the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson(Don Cheadle), is torn in a life crisis of balancing his career with his family. He notices his former college roommate Charlie Fineman(Adam Sandler)and wants to touch base. He finds that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the 9-11 attack on America, is no longer in touch with reality...choosing to involve his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games. The former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their former bond. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts(Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try and bring Charlie out of his grief...but it is Alan that accomplishes in getting his friend to emerge from his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's attorney/guardian. Also in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtrack featuring the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders.<br /><br />NOTE: I have never been a Sandler fan; but I found him outstanding in this role.

"This document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the United States thought about the September 11th attacks. This film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on U.S. soil. The aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives. I believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point. It also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not abusively so.

"After reading the reviews, it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work. How utterly boring. Oh how about the good ol' days and there was nothing like it. Of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other.<br /><br />I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with Dan'l Boone graced the Saturday afternoon matinées. This was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing, yapping, farting, giggling, snot monsters like myself or was-self. And it was a movie theatre filler at the time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />IMDb insists that every critique contains something about the plot. Problem is was that it was rather a template. Here goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy/hero)gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people. Hooray! <br /><br />All of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it. That was just about the plot line of every Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers film ever made. If you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just don't ask for surprises.<br /><br />One must remember the context of the times. There was no or little TV. None for kids. There was school. There was the great outdoors. There were toy guns. No Cyber time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers. Even the girls got into it.<br /><br />This movie was the entertainment. And it is just as mindless as anything produced today. It had a purpose originally of being propaganda. But quickly came to be kids movies.<br /><br />Our fathers had experienced the real thing. And it wouldn't be until Sam Peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities. Not until his directorship did anyone die slowly, with great pain and miserably. Until Peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair. Thanks Sam.<br /><br />To see a movie had little or no blood, the adults didn't mind. They wouldn't have tolerated it I think. No guts spraying the shattering plant life. So this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory. Gung Ho was suitable for kids then.<br /><br />You will see that I assigned a four to this rating. Why would I do that? Well. It is a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood. But it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms. Basically Gung Ho transitted to become a romance novel for children.<br /><br />Should people watch it. Of course. I am not saying to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple.

"Remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. The boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. The boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. A corker of a concluding scene! A Message From Charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present.

"At first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick, and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction. However, the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected, and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the World War II era Army. The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn.<br /><br />The obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values. The locations are great, the effects and action are weak. Imagine if ""Saving Private Ryan"" had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way Vin Diesel's Caparzo had (except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. Yet, the denouement, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and Boyd's racist Captain being effected by this, is compelling, as are the sequences of of Turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.<br /><br />In short, ""Black Brigade/Carter's Army"" doesn't quite succeed. But it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke.

"This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government.<br /><br />Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples. He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A-List about him. The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti-hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti-hero. That is not very normal. Jean Peters gave a so-so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold. That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool-pigeon.<br /><br />The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk. There is a fight scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was pretty gritty and exciting.<br /><br />I think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this film. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone.",1,this is a pretty decent example of film noir  the setting is the early 50s with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us government  richard widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples  he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a list about him  the interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film  an unlikeable anti hero  that is not very normal  jean peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold  that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the stool pigeon  the plot had its fair share of twists and turns  wisecracks and tough talk  there is a fight scene near the end of the movie  in the subway station  that was pretty gritty and exciting  i think noir fans  like myself  will enjoy this film  for non noir viewers  it may seem a little dated and the whole commie thing a tad overdone 
"So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt's a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves along, but Pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better earlier roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on `Homicide: Life on the Street' or in the brief series `Wonderland.'<br /><br />Vote: 6",1,so so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis  who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west  the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book  pitts a serial killer on the lam  unbeknownst to dave  and juliette is his poor  not all there companion  this is a good cast and the story moves along  but pitt isnt belivably scary as a serial killer  although it is one of his better earlier roles  the best thing is here is michelle forbes  who always manages to shine  whether in her roles on  homicide  life on the street or in the brief series  wonderland  vote  6
'Cry Freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth.<br /><br />The first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and Editor Don Woods (played fanatically by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods looking for answers on Biko's death.<br /><br />Although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods'.

"This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film. One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time. Clearly by the ""Sex in the City"" standards, Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However, when judged from the prospective of 1925 America, he was fantastic. Likewise Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair, American ""manifest destiny"" arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step to such films as Gentleman's Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget.<br /><br />However, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific. Although, some attack Brando's accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film.<br /><br />Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. Her speech when she first meets and speaks with Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema. The dialog between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film's end is equally good. Of course, it doesn't have the mouth-sucking, spit-swapping and worse, that exemplifies love in today's movies, but that makes it all the better. It portrays true love and passion, and not just ""heat."" If this movie doesn't touch you, then you are just too young, too cynical or dead.",1,this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen  yes  i can agree that some parts may seem dated  but this does not distract from the film  one should try to observe  criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time  clearly by the  sex in the city  standards  charlie chaplin was horribly boring  however  when judged from the prospective of 1925 america  he was fantastic  likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed race love affair  american  manifest destiny  arrogance and prejudice  and the complexity of different cultures  it is a natural next step to such films as gentlemans agreement  its purpose  however  was not just social commentary  rather  it is entertaining and enjoyable  with innumerable lines that one just doesnt forget  however  even when taken only as a love story  it is terrific  although  some attack brandos accent  he is at his near best in nuance and characterization  buttons and umeki  who both won oscars  and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film  taka  the real star  does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando  while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty  her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema  the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the films end is equally good  of course  it doesnt have the mouth sucking  spit swapping and worse  that exemplifies love in todays movies  but that makes it all the better  it portrays true love and passion  and not just  heat   if this movie doesnt touch you  then you are just too young  too cynical or dead 
"The location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film, Balta Street in Budapest but it could really be in any place. The small number of sets reflect a middle European design but it could be a shop around any corner. The film is not about Budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters.<br /><br />Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments. Mr Pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children. Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas. You even sense that quiet Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone.<br /><br />The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again, simple yet profound. The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days. <br /><br />All the acting is magnificent. Even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other perfectly. He was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days. Some of her other films are worth catching. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. Gold stars all round to the performers.<br /><br />It is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to (The vague re-make 'You've Got Mail' was dire) but in this case it is true. The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.",1,the location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film  balta street in budapest but it could really be in any place  the small number of sets reflect a middle european design but it could be a shop around any corner  the film is not about budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love  reflected in most of the main characters  alfred kralik and klara novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance  and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully  hugo matuschek  the owner of the shop  is having trouble with his wife  she only a voice at the end of the phone  ferencz vadas has a secret affair  ilona novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments  mr pirovitchs life is centred around his wife and children  pepi katona plays santa claus to a girl at christmas  you even sense that quiet flora katchuck  while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone  the script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama  it moves effortlessly from scene to scene  it is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again  simple yet profound  the dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days   all the acting is magnificent  even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect  james stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other perfectly  he was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance  margaret sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days  some of her other films are worth catching  as mr matuschek  frank morgan is amazing  his moment of truth is very moving  gold stars all round to the performers  it is a well worn phrase that they dont make them like they used to  the vague re make youve got mail was dire  but in this case it is true  the director lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit  charm and warm humanity 
"I saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? The victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man. They drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or,duh, burn him. Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame, who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid. The Egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film. Where is the mummy? Really just a curse unleashed. This does not hold a torch to Universal Mummy films in the least.Watch this movie if you need sleep, because you will dose off.",0,i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless  an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas  the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man  they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or duh  burn him  quentin alias mr  fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame  who is unhappy in marriage  wow  love plot  the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid  the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film  where is the mummy  really just a curse unleashed  this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least watch this movie if you need sleep  because you will dose off

This was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that I can see) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination. I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED that's just so unbelievable. What a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that.,1,this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk  the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it  all you have to do is read all the positive comments  not a single negative that i can see  to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination  i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled thats just so unbelievable  what a bunch of headless overpaid suited turkeys there must have been  or just maybe still are  running around to do that 
"I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. I have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart-breaking than his drug addiction. Here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass?<br /><br />At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I didn't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good TV episode?<br /><br />At any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the end, and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life. But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that",1,i just caught an episode about brad  the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started  i have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart breaking than his drug addiction  heres this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks  and immediately upon arriving he insults lance armstrong  one of the greatest athletes who ever lived  and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general  understandably  he is soon asked to leave  most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back  but what i wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass  at any rate  i was confused about how the show was put together  since it shows brad at the height of his addiction  we see footage of him pan handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine  i didnt even know that was legal to show  but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that  do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good tv episode  at any rate  it is an enlightening show  because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over peoples lives  sometimes its hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addicts indifference  although i have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean cut  there are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost  but still  and maybe i should warn about spoilers here  everything has a little too much of a happily ever after feel at the end  and i have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life  but still  its a show about people trying to help other people  and you can never complain too much about something like that
"An excellent film depicting the cross currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Solid directing and writing along with fine acting, especially the performances by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful ""Crash,"" written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in ""Apart From That,"" but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled and their stories as resonant as any of those in ""Crash."" For those viewers who appreciated ""Crash"" this is a must see film.

"I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in Paris. A very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers, all of them just at about the same psychologically stages. Many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age & our first feelings about sexual relations. it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism, but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the likelihood of the story. You can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere. I fund the young actresses of talent, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing.

"When I first saw this movie, it was titled TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of a double feature. Glenn Ford, an armament expert is called on to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high explosives. The tension is slow and steady; and this black & white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on TV; the tension and drama has lost most of its impact. This is still a good movie as far as early 50s standards go.<br /><br />Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham.

"A fierce, shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote ""My Beautiful Laundrette"", (this is the best thing he's done since then). It's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much. They've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels. The only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. He has his own motives but Kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion. This is a film in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen. In some respects it's a bit like ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" but it's an altogether tougher piece of work. The director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to build instinctively. And it is beautifully acted.<br /><br />As the eponymous mother Anne Reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. There is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance, and that very fine actor Daniel Craig displays shadings to his character than even Kureishi hasn't tapped into. If the film strikes a false note it is, perhaps, in the character of the talentless daughter, caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should that be the other way round) and even messier life, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless. The film is also extremely beautiful to look at (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must rank, unhesitatingly, as the best British film of the year.",1,a fierce  shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote  my beautiful laundrette    this is the best thing hes done since then   its about intelligent people whose lives dont add up to much  theyve squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels  the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex  he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion  this is a film in which people and places feel familiar  where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen  in some respects its a bit like  sunday  bloody sunday  but its an altogether tougher piece of work  the director  roger michell  allows scenes to build instinctively  and it is beautifully acted  as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture  there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived in performance  and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi hasnt tapped into  if the film strikes a false note it is  perhaps  in the character of the talentless daughter  caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces  or should that be the other way round  and even messier life  but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless  the film is also extremely beautiful to look at  dop alwin kuchler  and must rank  unhesitatingly  as the best british film of the year 
"Steely, powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine rugged form) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection. Fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (an amiable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace, sustains a suitably gritty, but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio (a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a nice, loose and engaging on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching. The ravishing Edwige Fenech alas isn't given much to do as Tony's whiny girlfriend Orchidea, but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin' spot. The polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise impressive.

"I love the series! Many of the stereotypes portraying Southerrners as hicks are very apparent, but such people do exist all too frequently. The portrayal of Southern government rings all too true as well, but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the South as well. Some things never change, and we see the ""good old boys"" every day! There is a Lucas Buck in every Southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen, and the storybook ""po' white trash"" are all too familiar.

"OK, I didn't know what to expect when I saw the cover to Fido, honestly when I came across it in the video store I was tempted to rent this movie, but nothing about it really grabbed my attention. But when I was looking around in Netflix, they were advertising this like crazy if I liked ""goofy"" scary movies, so I figured to just give it a shot. I'm so glad that I did watch it, this was just a great movie, it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch. Like I said, it's Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead, it's just a great concept, what does happen after a mega zombie attack? As we see in another zombie comedy, Shaun of the Dead, they have fun by making the zombies left over as ""handy"" citizens. This is a very overlooked horror/comedy movie, I think a lot of people were just so blown away with Shaun of the Dead that this got the boot. But it's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie.<br /><br />In a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. This radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead. In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named Zomcon. Zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants. In the town of Willard, a housewife ,Helen, buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill's zombie phobia. Their son, Timmy, befriends the zombie, naming him ""Fido"". One day Fido's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. Timmy ""kills"" the zombified neighbor. When a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor, they capture Fido and Timmy. Helen comes and rescues Timmy and Fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, the neighbor's body is found and the murder is traced back to Fido, who is taken away to Zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed. Timmy learns through a friend that Fido is simply working in a factory at Zomcon. Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get Fido back.<br /><br />I really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's so silly but a lot of fun. Billy Connelly did a great job as Fido and really brought, no pun intended, a lot of life into the character. I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Timmy has to burry the old lady that Fido attacked and killed, his last words to her were so funny, ""you weren't really nice, but you liked flowers, so"" and he buries her in the garden. Not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend, sick, disturbing, wrong, but classic laughs. I still love how even though this is like the Leave It To Beaver-esquire type of world, there still is a lot of gore in the movie. So if you do have a chance to see Fido, take it, I promise some good laughs.<br /><br />9/10",1,ok  i didnt know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido  honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie  but nothing about it really grabbed my attention  but when i was looking around in netflix  they were advertising this like crazy if i liked  goofy  scary movies  so i figured to just give it a shot  im so glad that i did watch it  this was just a great movie  it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch  like i said  its pleasantville meets night of the living dead  its just a great concept  what does happen after a mega zombie attack  as we see in another zombie comedy  shaun of the dead  they have fun by making the zombies left over as  handy  citizens  this is a very overlooked horror comedy movie  i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot  but its a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie  in a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies  this radiation still plagues humanity  as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead  in order to continue living normal lives  communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named zomcon  zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants  in the town of willard  a housewife  helen  buys a zombie in spite of her husband bills zombie phobia  their son  timmy  befriends the zombie  naming him  fido   one day fidos collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor  who turns into a zombie  timmy  kills  the zombified neighbor  when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor  they capture fido and timmy  helen comes and rescues timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing  several days later  the neighbors body is found and the murder is traced back to fido  who is taken away to zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed  timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at zomcon  timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido back  i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it  its so silly but a lot of fun  billy connelly did a great job as fido and really brought  no pun intended  a lot of life into the character  i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to burry the old lady that fido attacked and killed  his last words to her were so funny   you werent really nice  but you liked flowers  so  and he buries her in the garden  not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend  sick  disturbing  wrong  but classic laughs  i still love how even though this is like the leave it to beaver esquire type of world  there still is a lot of gore in the movie  so if you do have a chance to see fido  take it  i promise some good laughs  9 10
"I was willing to go with the original _Cruel Intentions._ It went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this movie was, in my opinion, a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices. I didn't honestly care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I wasn't clear until I read the IMDB that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially since the title includes a number ""2,"" I expected a sequel, but then determined that it must be a companion piece. Over all, I must say that this movie read, to me at least, like a soft porn version of Les Liasons.

"It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy. There is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of the time. It has a real heart to it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a big future and I for one, am looking out for his next project. The follow up is always the most difficut thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film. Cheers to all.

"It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought ''Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it's a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />The second thing is I wonder why it got it's TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like either. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons''.<br /><br />3.5/10",0,it was 9 30 pm last night at my friends camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park  a new episode   the thing is  in my country  south park airs at 10 30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing  father of the pride  ill start by saying that i have only watched to episodes  the first time i watched it  i found it unfunny and crude for nothing  so i thought holy sh t  i have a football game early tomorrow  so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons  but yesterday  i tried to give father of the pride a second chance  i find that its a complete rip off of the simpsons  only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead  the second thing is i wonder why it got its tv 14 rating  i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar  and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual  unfunny  jokes  the simpsons is also a lot more violent  halloween specials  and crude  i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2  well ive got news for him  shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic  however  i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile  even burst out laughing once  three or four times  all in all  i dont mind father of the pride  i dont hate it  but i dont like either  ive seen way better from the simpsons  3 5 10

"Superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit, absurdness and Serbian mentality. Movie is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting, unpredictable. Best point in a film: characters, then humor itself, story and dialogs. Humor has 'inner development' , rare in Serbian movies. So, it is consequence of characterization, is well motivated, spontaneous and cogent. Also it is sharp, intelligent and lucid. Most of the movies, unfortunately, had constructed humor (devise a joke and put it into a characters's mouth) or ordinary situation comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the 'art immortality' are incorporated in this movie. Little masterpiece, hardly reachable.",1,superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit  absurdness and serbian mentality  movie is a great comedy  enjoyable  interesting  unpredictable  best point in a film  characters  then humor itself  story and dialogs  humor has inner development   rare in serbian movies  so  it is consequence of characterization  is well motivated  spontaneous and cogent  also it is sharp  intelligent and lucid  most of the movies  unfortunately  had constructed humor  devise a joke and put it into a characterss mouth  or ordinary situation comedy  burlesque  farce  some of the art immortality are incorporated in this movie  little masterpiece  hardly reachable 
If your a hard core Freddy fan then you might not like it. This seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason it holds it self up is the back story on Freddy.<br /><br />The one thing that is always great in Nightmare movies are the death scenes. But the death scenes were very crappy in this. The visual effects were great and the acting was OK but the back story was excellent. Basically Freddy's story comes full circle in this.<br /><br />I have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws: <br /><br />1. A Nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /><br />2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /><br />3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /><br />4. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors.

"Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is. I wish it were ""so bad it's good,"" but it's not. It's just dull, lifeless, and boring. It's so bad I couldn't even laugh at it.<br /><br />In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly, who as a true statement on vanity, cast himself as the male lead. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother.<br /><br />The gal, Sherry Thurig, is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy, and can act. Although you can tell she's holding back.<br /><br />All the actors seem to be holding back, especially the supporting male, Mark. I've seen less wood in a rain forest, but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting? Is he really that bad a director? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn't one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping in the poo, it's how I felt after watching his movie.<br /><br />Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out, you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks).",0,words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is  i wish it were  so bad its good   but its not  its just dull  lifeless  and boring  its so bad i couldnt even laugh at it  in response to other posters  anne marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie  the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly  who as a true statement on vanity  cast himself as the male lead  they both look like inbreeds  sister and brother  the gal  sherry thurig  is a looker  the complete opposite of anne marie   attractive  this girl is tall and willowy  and can act  although you can tell shes holding back  all the actors seem to be holding back  especially the supporting male  mark  ive seen less wood in a rain forest  but hes still better than kelly  why would kelly keep his actors from acting  is he really that bad a director  everyone else has summed the story up perfectly   there isnt one  kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime  i know how he felt stepping in the poo  its how i felt after watching his movie  yes  i tried to get my money back from the rental store  this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director  and if you search them out  youll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks  
"This Movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately they had forgotten how to act. I was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start. It actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time. Maybe it was the Musical score or the Director himself, but one thing is for sure the Make-up artist needs to get another job ! The Facial Powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces ! Would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it never hit the Theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all.

"Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted. Lame jokes abound, and every punch line is well telegraphed. The dumb one liners come at a fast pace, and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and seek out one of ""Lampoon's"" truly funny films like ""National Lampoon's Golddiggers"" - MERK",0,stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment  gerrit graham  michael lerner  zane busby  and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted  lame jokes abound  and every punch line is well telegraphed  the dumb one liners come at a fast pace  and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape  the musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie  another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school  avoid this and seek out one of  lampoons  truly funny films like  national lampoons golddiggers    merk

"This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.<br /><br />As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.<br /><br />Very disappointing - avoid it.",0,this movie is flawed on many fronts  like many before it  it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history  the production is poor  overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares  this to me was the greatest flaw   i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude  as a native texan  i grew up with the mythology  i later learned more about the history  i can accept a decent production from either perspective  although i prefer more historical accuracy   but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it  even john waynes or fess parkers versions had more life than this stolid mess  while being only slightly less accurate  very disappointing   avoid it

It ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.The rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be. The make-up was good and I have seen way worse movies then this one.

"""In the world of old-school kung fu movies, where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen, it took a lot for a film to stand out -- and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years. What is arguably Chang Cheh's finest movie continues to hold influence over the Hong Kong movie industry, from the themes of loyalty, brotherhood and revenge as explored by John Woo (who got his start in the HK movie industry working for Chang) during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's, to more modern movies like A Man Called Hero, which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film. The influence has also carried into other areas as well, from music such as the Wu-Tang Clan, TV commercials for Sprite and video games such as ""Mortal Kombat."" So what makes this movie so special? The plot -- on the surface -- is pretty simple. It deals with members of a rogue group known as the ""Poison Clan"" who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu. All of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities, denoted by their animal styles, or ""venoms"" (the lizard can climb walls, the scorpion has a deadly strike, etc.). The twist is that since the clan always wears masks, not all of them known who the others are. Thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller. We're not talking The Usual Suspects here, but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time. Supposedly, Golden Harvest was not too happy with Chang's script -- like most of his movies, they felt it was too dark and violent -- and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it. Thankfully, Chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script, which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time, if not ever, completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences.<br /><br />But what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves. Chang Cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast -- not only did he gain talented martial artists (whose moves, competed without the aid of wires or other special effects, put most modern martial artists to shame) but great actors as well. The formula proved so popular that Chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies. Getting back to matters at hand, in most old-school movies, the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts, but here the actors actually create characters. It seems that everyone has a favorite venom (mine is Philip Kwok -- best known to many as Mad Dog from Hard-Boiled -- as Lizard) and it is this personal connection to the characters that The Five Deadly Venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre. Even if you're normally not a fan of old-school movies, you need to check The Five Deadly Venoms out, if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from.""",1, in the world of old school kung fu movies  where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen  it took a lot for a film to stand out    and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years  what is arguably chang chehs finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry  from the themes of loyalty  brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo  who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang  during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980s  to more modern movies like a man called hero  which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film  the influence has also carried into other areas as well  from music such as the wu tang clan  tv commercials for sprite and video games such as  mortal kombat   so what makes this movie so special  the plot    on the surface    is pretty simple  it deals with members of a rogue group known as the  poison clan  who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu  all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities  denoted by their animal styles  or  venoms   the lizard can climb walls  the scorpion has a deadly strike  etc    the twist is that since the clan always wears masks  not all of them known who the others are  thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller  were not talking the usual suspects here  but its far above many other kung fu movies of the time  supposedly  golden harvest was not too happy with changs script    like most of his movies  they felt it was too dark and violent    and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it  thankfully  chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script  which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time  if not ever  completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences  but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves  chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast    not only did he gain talented martial artists  whose moves  competed without the aid of wires or other special effects  put most modern martial artists to shame  but great actors as well  the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies  getting back to matters at hand  in most old school movies  the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts  but here the actors actually create characters  it seems that everyone has a favorite venom  mine is philip kwok    best known to many as mad dog from hard boiled    as lizard  and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre  even if youre normally not a fan of old school movies  you need to check the five deadly venoms out  if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from  
"I attended Camp Chesapeake. It was located at the head of the Chesapeake bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar type summer camp with cabins. It was established by the Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started out as a young camper and later became a Junior, Senior counselor and later, the Waterfront director. If the camp had continued, I would have done anything within my power to become the camp director. Alas the powers of the YMCA decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the former camp some years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of MD and natural destruction by mother nature. The 350 acre site served so many with all the benefits of contact with natures offerings. A black man by the name of Curtis Ford, and his family were residents and caretakers of the property. Mr Curtis was my friend and mentor. I idolized his every being. Even as he could not swim he was a waterman. If I asked him where the fish were biting, he would designate the spot, and I would have a ball. Ther was also a Family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me for eternity.",1,i attended camp chesapeake  it was located at the head of the chesapeake bay on the north east river in md  it was a similar type summer camp with cabins  it was established by the coatesville  pa ymca  i started out as a young camper and later became a junior  senior counselor and later  the waterfront director  if the camp had continued  i would have done anything within my power to become the camp director  alas the powers of the ymca decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of md  i visited the former camp some years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of md and natural destruction by mother nature  the 350 acre site served so many with all the benefits of contact with natures offerings  a black man by the name of curtis ford  and his family were residents and caretakers of the property  mr curtis was my friend and mentor  i idolized his every being  even as he could not swim he was a waterman  if i asked him where the fish were biting  he would designate the spot  and i would have a ball  ther was also a family camp at the end of the summer  these memories will be with me for eternity 
"I have seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favourite Stan and Ollie short.<br /><br />In this one, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp! The best part is where Ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head, but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this.<br /><br />Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest. Great fun.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars out of 5.",1,i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short  in this one  stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of professor noodle  lucien littlefield   while noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab  stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room  the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp  the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head  but he doesnt seem to suffer much pain from this  dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest  great fun  rating  5 stars out of 5 
"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I am going to let him off easy. I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. The characters are good, also. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox (George Clooney)'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially engaging. The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. I'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment.",0,fantastic mr  fox is a comedy based on the classic roald dahl book  wes anderson directs  and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film  while i respect what anderson  an incredibly talented man did  the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit  anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man  and if this happened to be a bad film  it would be his first bad film  just like when you go to school and have your first bad day  this is andersons first bad day in film making  so i am going to let him off easy  i will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it  and the animation is nice  but the film gets progressively harder to get into  leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening  the characters are good  also  jason schwartzman voices mr  fox  george clooney s smart ass son  ash  and especially engaging  the film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness  but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along  im sure wes anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film  but for now  im sorry  wes anderson  this film of yours was a big disappointment 
"I like movies about UFOs, which is why I recently decided to rewatch EYES BEHIND THE STARS after seeing it when I was a kid back in the late 1970s. And now I'm compelled to write a review about it because I'm afraid I'll start forgetting everything about it FAST. You see, even though EBTS ain't bad, it's VERY dull and nondescript. The story is sorta interesting but flat. The actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing. The FX are terribly amateurish but I can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling, which, unfortunately, this one ain't.<br /><br />Also, there's very little violence and there's no nudity whatsoever, which makes this 1970s Italian sci-fi opus a TRUE oddity, because if there's one thing that distinguishes Italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade, it's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them. Oddly enough, because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements, EBTS stands out from the rest of the pact. I don't know if this can be seen as a compliment though. Personally, I can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but I think EBTS NEEDED more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry. And the special effects aren't that special.<br /><br />The story itself is actually interesting. It's a combo of THE X-FILES and Antonioni's BLOWUP: a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country. The aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model, subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth. The problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer's apartment (this taking place just before she's to be abducted herself). The man takes some of the negatives and leaves, with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives. The whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives. The majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue, in the spy vs spy variety. The UFO element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war McGuffin. But as dull as EYES BEHIND THE STARS is, it does resemble THE X-FILES a LOT! I wonder if Chris Carter saw this movie. Anyway, the best thing in EBTS are the POV shots, which are creepy and effective. But the rest is almost completely forgettable, including the goofy looking aliens.<br /><br />Even though I've been mostly negative about this film, I sorta cherish it nonetheless. I still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when I saw it as a kid. And I own the video. The film could have been so much more if it had been done properly.

"This is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever, and may be one of the best movies ever... It's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle, with lots of intrigue and suspense. This film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions, with people hiding their identities and their natures. The characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters. They are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality's and desires.<br /><br />The fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting. It has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy. There are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal. The styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film... When this happens, The director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel. These cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely.<br /><br />One thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death. The director Chang Cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death. This makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective. We actually care when people are killed in this film. This is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed. Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching. When characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain.<br /><br />At the same time, this is also a fun movie. It has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film. There is bad dubbing, The characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat. Some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic... all this just adds to the greatness of the film.<br /><br />And lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries. If you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic. Everything goes by so fast (because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre) that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is. The lighting and composition are spectacular at times. The camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing... In the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example, imagine Hitchcock moving at about twice the speed. Chang Cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it's confines. He doesn't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film, but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work. He is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people.<br /><br />This is the real package A kung fu movie that delivers on every level. It's art, it's trash, it's emotionally moving, and it's fun, it has a true sense of morality, but doesn't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action. I recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not.",1,this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever  and may be one of the best movies ever    its got a great plot that functions like a puzzle  with lots of intrigue and suspense  this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions  with people hiding their identities and their natures  the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters  they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personalitys and desires  the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting  it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy  there are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal  the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film    when this happens  the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel  these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely  one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death  the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death  this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective  we actually care when people are killed in this film  this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed  some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching  when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain  at the same time  this is also a fun movie  it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film  there is bad dubbing  the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat  some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic    all this just adds to the greatness of the film  and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries  if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic  everything goes by so fast  because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre  that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is  the lighting and composition are spectacular at times  the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing    in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example  imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed  chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within its confines  he doesnt rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film  but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work  he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people  this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level  its art  its trash  its emotionally moving  and its fun  it has a true sense of morality  but doesnt allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action  i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not 
"This ABC straight-to-TV failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Ms. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults alike into a magical, fantastical and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first in her 'time quartet', is a beautiful take on life, the universe, and time itself. Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand. Its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Ms. L'Engle's work of art. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is mushy and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost. This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that someday an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón) makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, fake and cheap motel-room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience.",0,this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time  ms  madeleine lengle brought children and adults alike into a magical  fantastical and original world like no author before her  this novel  the first in her time quartet  is a beautiful take on life  the universe  and time itself  yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand  its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book  this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms  lengles work of art  honestly  what were they thinking  the effects look cheap and ridiculous  the plot is mushy and uneven  the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost  this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen  i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent  worthy director  guillermo del toro  david yates  alfonso cuarón  makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is  a masterpiece  this adaptation can only be compared to boring  fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience 
"I remember the first time I saw this movie -- I was in the office working over the weekend & the TV was on for background noise. But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie I'd never seen or heard of, until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (the British title -- Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delightful, compelling, whimsical, & moving, all in one superbly-written, well-acted, perfectly-directed package. It's a classic that really does rank right up there with Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, & Chariots of Fire. WHY has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence? Fortunately, SOME knowledgeable critics HAVE put it on their ""Top 100 of all time"" lists. There IS hope -- 1940's Fantasia wasn't a hit 'til the '60s, & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by TV. Buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it!

"I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.",1,i agree that capital city should be on dvd  i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot  it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change  i loved rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in  i cant believe the show only lasted 13 episodes  i liked william armstrong as hudsons flamboyant charming friend in the series  when they aired this show in the new york city area  it was always late at night or at off times  the show is less than an hour long  i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting  i didnt care for sylvia but missed the actress  julia phillips lane in the previous season  i felt this show took chances and often it worked  it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london  the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts  i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british  i liked watching julia ormond in an early role  i felt this show should have lasted longer  i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour  they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america 
"This- and not a certain slightly overrated Southern Soap Opera-was the greatest epic to come out of Hollywoods greatest year, 1939.I will not not restate the obvious-Cary Grant,Victor McLaglen( who WAS a Bengal Lancer), and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. give superb comic performances.However, I want to note two other, less understood elements of this masterpiece. The Magnificent final battle sequence, as the wonderful Sam Jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment, is simply grand. It never fails to enthrall me. Yet another underrated element in the film is Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as the Guru. This is no Fu Manchu caricature, but an well drawn, articulate, historically informed ( ""Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya?He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander The Great"")villain. Indeed, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties( A German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi tract? Not quite.
